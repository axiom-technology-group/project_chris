1,"An intercity railway linking Beijing and the Xiongan New Area will start construction in March, the Beijing News reported Monday, citing a report by China Railway Design Corp. The construction of the 92.783-kilometer intercity line, with a total investment of 33.38 billion yuan ($5.22 billion), is scheduled to last for two years and be completed in Feb 2020, the report said. The line will start from Liying Railway Station in Beijing's Daxing district, pass through Beijing's new airport, and terminate at Xiongan Railway Station in Xiongxian county. According to the report, the Beijing-Xiongan intercity rail line will be divided into three sections: Beijing West Railway Station-Liying Railway Station, Liying Railway Station-Beijing's new airport, and Beijing's new airport-Xiongan. The design speed of the Liying-Beijing's new airport line is set at 250 kilometers per hour, while the Beijing's new airport-Xiongan line is 350 kilometers per hour. Meanwhile, the Beijing-Xiongan intercity line will stop at five stations, including three new added stations: Gu'an East station, Bazhou North station and Xiongan station. China announced plans in April 2017 to establish the Xiongan New Area about 100 kilometers southwest of Beijing. It covers Hebei's Xiongxian, Rongcheng and Anxin counties. A transportation plan showing how the Xiongan New Area will link with Beijing, Tianjin and other areas in Hebei province was unveiled, China Central Television earlier reported. According to the plan, four north-south high-speed railway lines and two east-west routes will pass through Xiongan. Besides railways, the network map also includes seven expressways that will connect the new area to regions near and far."
1,"Version 2.0 of China's plan to open the financial sector to foreign investors was reinforced during the weekend when a senior regulator said market access thresholds for banks and insurance companies would be lowered or abolished. Speaking on Saturday, Wang Zhaoxing, vice-chairman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, said some rules, including certain ""quantitative"" requirements on the scale, years of operation and share proportions of foreign financial institutions will be eased. The move is aimed at persuading more professional overseas banks and insurance companies to enter the Chinese market. ""We are studying withdrawing or lowering these restrictions,"" Wang told the audience at the China Development Forum 2019, a large event that has been held by the think tank of the State Council, China's Cabinet, for 20 consecutive years. Wang said the regulator will allow foreign companies to provide more diversified financial products and services in the onshore market, taking advantage of their capabilities in terms of risk control and high-standard compliance. Executives of foreign financial institutions expect the ""second stage"" of China's financial opening-up to progress at a faster pace than previous developments and feature more market-oriented competition. ""We hope progress will continue and the Chinese market can keep opening so our bank can provide more business here,"" said Bill Winters, CEO of Standard Chartered Group, who expected to see more unified competition rules. Further opening-up of the financial sector seeks to channel more foreign capital to support economic growth amid trade tensions and weaker domestic investment. Last year, Yi Gang, governor of the People's Bank of China, the central bank, announced a package of financial opening measures. During the past year, the Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission has launched 15 specific policies to open the market further. The measures include allowing foreign-funded banks to conduct operations such as underwriting government bonds, and lifting foreign ownership limits on banks and financial asset management firms. In his address on Saturday, Wang stressed that during the extended opening-up procedure, regulators will work to prevent systemic risks by strengthening the prevention of financial risks and building financial regulatory capacity compatible with the greater openness of the financial sector. Ng Keng Hooi, president and CEO of AIA Group, said: ""We are looking forward to the next stage of China's opening-up in the financial sector. As a foreign insurance company, we can bring in new ideas to facilitate the development of the domestic insurance industry."" On Friday, Bank of Beijing and ING Group, a banking and financial services corporation in the Netherlands, announced that they plan to establish a joint venture bank, becoming the first commercial lender in China controlled by a foreign shareholder. On Jan 28, the PBOC announced that it had approved an application from S&P Global to establish a wholly owned subsidiary in Beijing called S&P Ratings (China). Meanwhile, the National Association of Financial Market Institutional Investors also released a public notice confirming it had approved the registration of S&P Ratings (China) to conduct a bond credit ratings business in the interbank bond market, signaling the entry of the first foreign credit ratings agency into the domestic market."
1,"The first China International Import Expo is making a concerted effort to ensure the protection of intellectual property rights and deal with commercial disputes during the event. The event organizer, the China International Import Expo Bureau, has set up a center for IPR protection, where professionals from relevant departments have been invited to offer on-site consultation and services to participants. Wang Bingnan, vice-minister of commerce, said the expo attaches great importance to IPR protection because it is a platform for the release of new technologies and products, and it aims to create a fair trading environment and effectively safeguard the interests of all parties. According to the bureau, specific measures include a work plan for IPR protection during the expo, optimizing regulations on the exhibits and strengthening inspection. Local government departments have also formulated guidelines related to the issue and pushed forward measures to crack down on violations. The move symbolizes China's decadeslong effort to improve IPR protection. The government has made the task a priority and says the measures it has taken have proved effective. The country ranked 17th in terms of the ""most innovative economies"" in the annual Global Innovation Index released in July by the World Intellectual Property Organization and Cornell University in the United States. Last year, China moved up to second place in terms of international patent applications, with about 51,000 applications submitted. According to the Peterson Institute of International Economics in Washington, China's payments of licensing fees and royalties for the use of foreign technology recorded a fourfold increase in the past decade, reaching $28.6 billion last year, ranking fourth in the world. China ranks second globally in the scale of licensing fees paid for technology used within its borders, second only to the US. Shen Changyu, head of the State Intellectual Property Office, said the country will adopt stricter IPR protection regulations and continue to firmly uphold international rules on IPR. ""IPR protection is key to innovation-driven development and international trade, which also plays an indispensable role in the country's opening-up,"" Shen said at the 2018 China Patent Annual Conference in Beijing. He said the country will enhance international cooperation in IPR and promote the building of open, inclusive, balanced and effective international IPR rules. Jin Qin, director of the Office of Technology Transfer at Tsinghua University, said the government should place more emphasis on improving IPR protection, which can optimize the business environment and thereby facilitate innovation. Jin made the comments at the launch ceremony of the Nation Intellectual Property Protection Action Plan, which aims to improve IPR and give impetus to innovative activities."
0,"BEIJING - China's latest air pollution inspections have uncovered rampant violations of environmental rules among businesses, highlighting the tough battle ahead against pollution.  From early April to May 11, inspectors discovered that some 6,378 companies, or 66.7 percent of those examined, violated environmental standards, according to findings from a month of inspections across 28 cities in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and other nearby areas.  Of those, small-scale firms accounted for more than one-third as regulators struggled to properly regulate them, according to reports from the Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP).  Excessive emissions and insufficient pollution-control equipment were among the most common problems for the inspected businesses. The MEP has asked local authorities to shut down or halt production at companies that failed to meet environmental protection standards.  The inspections are expected to last for a year.  Earlier official data showed cities in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region saw more days with ""good"" air quality in April.  The 13 cities in the region reported good air quality on 23 days during the month on average, up 16.5 percent year on year. An average daily Air Quality Index (AQI) of less than 100 is defined as ""good"" under Chinese air quality standards."
1,"South Korea's Lotte Shopping said on Thursday that it has agreed to sell 21 Lotte Mart hypermarket and supermarket stores in China to Wumart Stores Inc for around 248.5 billion won ($230.2 million). Lotte will sell a 87.38 percent stake in Lotte Mart in Beijing to Wumart and keep the remaining shares, according to Lotte Mart China. Lotte Mart has 110 retail outlets in China. Of them, 99 are hypermarkets and 11 are supermarkets. The 21 outlets involved in the deal with Wumart include 10 hypermarkets and 11 supermarkets. Last year, Lotte Shopping picked Goldman Sachs to manage the sale of its Lotte Mart stores in China. Wumart is the leading retailer in Beijing and it makes sense to further strengthen its presence in Beijing by adding more stores from the deal, said Jason Yu, general manager of Kantar Worldpanel China, a research firm. Wumart has carried out its online-to-offline services through its mobile application Dmall to serve more consumers in the New Retail digital age, requiring more brick-and-mortar stores to shorten delivery distances between stores and consumers, Yu said. He added that consumers usually place orders using the app and the store delivers in 30 minutes. Therefore, Wumart wants to expand its store coverage to reach more consumers throughout the capital. Yu earlier said that Lotte Mart has been facing competition from Chinese retailers and e-commerce giants. Due to its limited presence, it could not build economies of scale or create an efficient supply chain, he said. According to Kantar's 2017 report on fast-moving consumer goods, the sector had sales growth of 4.3 percent year-on-year. Retailers associated with the two e-commerce giants Tencent and JD led by Walmart, Carrefour and Yonghui have market share of 12.8 percent, slightly higher than those retailers involved with Alibaba Group including Sun Art Retail, which operates leading supermarket chains RT-Mart and Auchan in China. International retailers have found a smaller market presence, falling from 11.1 percent in 2016 to 10.3 percent in 2017."
1,"Air routes and an advanced international railway network have transformed Chengdu - in landlocked Sichuan province - in major ways since China's reform and opening-up policies were introduced in the late 1970s. Now the city can align growth closely with the outside world thanks to the extensive transportation network. Every student of Chinese literature knows the famous line from Li Bai, a great poet in the Tang Dynasty (618-907): ""Traveling in Sichuan is as difficult as mounting to the sky."" That line would remind many Chinese people of Sichuan's deplorable inaccessibility in 1978. ""Forty years ago, Sichuan didn't have a single international air route. There was only a daily flight from Chengdu to Beijing. It took a day and two nights to get there on the fastest train at that time,"" said Shen Zaiwang, a senior official with Sichuan People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries. With the opening of the Xi'an-Chengdu Bullet Train a year ago, the trip takes only 10 hours. Known for its silk products in ancient times, Chengdu was a major source of cargo on the Silk Road, starting from Xi'an, Shaanxi province, some 700 kilometers away. Now, Chengdu not only has bullet trains linking to parts of China but also boasts trains linking to Europe. Last month, a freight train originating in Bremerhaven, Germany, arrived at the Chengdu International Railway Port in the first test of the China-EU Express Railway (Chengdu). It increased the number of overseas departure terminals to 22. The express railway, a direct line for freight that was launched in 2013 to connect Chengdu to Europe, has eliminated the geographic disadvantages of Chengdu as a landlocked city and transformed the city into an important logistics hub and economic exchange center between Europe and western China. Chengdu has sent 2,597 freight trains to Europe in the past five years, 25 percent of China's total. ""With the increasing global influence of the China-EU Express Railway (Chengdu), a growing number of multinational companies are establishing a presence here,"" said Zhang Tianyi, deputy director of the management committee of the city's railway port. Italy, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Israel and Moldova have located their national commodity pavilions at the port. A similar story has played out in the air. As the largest aviation hub in central and western China, Chengdu currently has 112 international air routes that enable it to expand cooperation and exchanges with the outside, while boosting domestic investment. It is home to 285 Fortune Global 500 companies and 17 foreign consulates, the most of any city in central and western China. Since its debut in the Chengdu - as part of the China (Sichuan) Pilot Free Trade Zone in early 2017 - the southwest operation center of dhgate.com said it has seen a 300 percent increase in business volume and a drop of around 30 percent in its logistics fees in the past 18 months. The company helps small and medium-sized enterprises in Sichuan sell their commodities in some 130 countries and regions. Its general manager, Zhu Rong, said the growth is largely due to the facility's proximity to Shuangliu International Airport in Chengdu. Du Jinyou, head of Chengdu's logistics office, said the city will accelerate the pace of setting up seven international railway channels, along with five channels that combine sea and rail transportation, in a bid to become the hub of the new Eurasian land bridge linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Chengdu's global air network will include business routes covering 48 core aviation hubs and economic centers; cargo-only routes directly linking with 14 key logistics cities, including Frankfurt, Chicago and Amsterdam; and another 30 high-quality routes serving the demand for tourism and culture, he said. Peng Chao contributed to this story."
1,"Zhang Fan, 33, stopped by a newsstand one recent Sunday morning near his home in Beijing to buy a magazine, only to find the stand had been shut down. Zhang, a designer living on the Guangqumenwai street in Chaoyang district, used to visit a stand just 500 meters from his residential community to buy newspapers and magazines. But since he started to read news and other material on his phone, he can count on one hand the number of times he has visited the stand in the past year. He had not even noticed it had been closed for the past four months. Due to falling demand for newspapers and magazines, newsstands in many cities have been closing. They have also been criticized for obstructing roads and sidewalks and for generally being eyesores. The Beijing municipal government has decided to upgrade and regulate the city's newsstands by turning them into ""innovative reading spaces"" and ""convenient service providers"" to better serve the public. Li Zhigang, who is in his 40s and comes from Anhui province, runs a different newsstand in Guangqumenwai. ""I haven't been given any notice of closure, but I noticed most newsstands within the Second Ring Road were torn down this year,"" he said. ""I don't know any details about the new policy, but I hope I can continue my business."" According to the Beijing Municipal Commission of City Management, the city's newsstands will be better located based on passenger flow, the number of people living in nearby residential communities, and public demand. Under the plan drafted by the commission and the Beijing Municipal Commerce Bureau, newsstands will become more like convenience stores and be ""more fashionable"". The plan has been submitted to the municipal government for approval. An official with the commission, who declined to be named, said the plan clearly states that the number of newsstands in the city should be based on public need. ""There is no easy way to solve the contradiction between people who love the printed word and have the habit of buying from the newsstands, and the owners' continued operational losses,"" the official said. ""It's also difficult to decide which department is responsible for footing the bill to upgrade newsstands."",The commission - and many people in Beijing - wants the streets to be wider and cleaner. With this in mind, it introduced a regulation in summer last year banning all 352 newsstands in the downtown districts of Dongcheng and Xicheng from selling food and drinks. Three stands were closed for selling food illegally. Since then, many stands in the two districts have closed because most of their business came from food and drinks, while sales of newspapers and magazines were highly unprofitable. There are 1,186 newsstands in the city, of which 306 - that are not in the two districts - are licensed to sell food and drinks. The closure of stands has attracted public attention, with many people, especially the elderly, strongly opposed to administrative intervention, as they have happy memories of visiting them. Some people raised the idea of introducing newspaper vending machines, which are clean and convenient, but China Post Group is unwilling to pay for them as it believes they would be too costly to set up and they would not make a profit, according to an industry insider who declined to be named. The official with the commission said: ""The new policy has considered all aspects, and attempts to solve problems. We put the public interest first. The city will not keep a newsstand running for just a few people. Also, we won't remove a stand that has a good turnover. It all depends on the market and needs."" Generally, newsstands will be closer to their customers after they are moved to residential communities or become part of convenience stores. The government will make those that remain more attractive, the official said. Newsstands may be facing pressures now, but they have had their good days. Yang Na, who is in her 50s and comes from Hebei province, started running a stand in Beijing in 1998. In 2002, she bought her first apartment in the capital for 400,000 yuan - money she made from selling newspapers and magazines. Before the internet became widely available, and with Beijing being the country's cultural and political center, most people liked to get their news from newspapers and television bulletins. In 1997, the Beijing municipal government made setting up newsstands a city-level project and approved 75 stands that year.,In 1999, the city began setting up newsstands on a large scale. Two years later, the authorities decided to regulate the stands through an overall planning, management and supply channel. The peak year was 2008, when the city had 2,500 newsstands, more than twice the number now. At that time, Yang's stand only sold newspapers and magazines. Her profit was about 7,000 yuan a month. Ten years later, she makes almost the same amount with the help of food and drink sales. ""I miss the days in 2007 when I sold several boxes of fashion magazines each day,"" she said. On Jan 9, 2007, Steve Jobs, chairman, CEO and co-founder of Apple Inc, announced the arrival of the iPhone at his company in the United States. Since then, smartphones and the mobile internet have rapidly changed the reading habits of people worldwide. Yang said: ""From 2009, business started to decline. And it's never picked up again."" During a one-hour interview with Yang at her newsstand, seven customers arrived to buy drinks; four bought cigarettes and only one bought a newspaper. The man who bought the paper said: ""It's very convenient to have newsstands. I hope they will be kept by the authorities. As for food and drinks, I don't care. If they want to ban them for safety reasons, this is fine by me."" A customer who bought cigarettes said he had not bought any newspapers or magazines at this stand for years, adding, ""It's just a cigarettes stand for me."",Yang said she might start another small business, or retire if she cannot continue to run her newsstand. ""If there is a chance, I hope I can continue my newsstand business because I have been doing this for so long and many people living nearby come to buy newspapers or magazines regularly. We have become friends despite only exchanging a few words over the years. People know me,"" she said. More important, Yang said business is not as bad as some people think. As long as she can continue to sell food, drinks and cigarettes, the income can sustain her in Beijing, despite the high cost of living. According to China Post Group, the country had 30,506 newsstands at the end of 2014 - 20,000 fewer than in 2008. With the rise of the internet, and with newsstands starting to create problems such as obstructing roads and sidewalks, some cities have taken strict and quick action. In 2009, Wuxi city, Jiangsu province, removed 1,241 newsstands. In 2012, Zhengzhou, capital of Henan province, dismantled all 421 stands in the city and authorities said newspapers and magazines could only be sold in stores. Luo Ping, a writer who lives in Beijing's Tongzhou district, wrote to the authorities last year, saying that newsstands are still an important part of the city's public cultural system and should not be neglected. She received a reply thanking her for her letter, and saying her views would be taken into account. However, she still fears for the stands' future.,""It is not easy to build a network of newsstands in a city. They are the closest cultural facilities to ordinary people,"" Luo said. ""They have a reason to exist."" Luo suggested that newsstand owners could try to sell innovative cultural products such as paper cuts and needlework to make up for the losses from selling newspapers. However, all items sold at newsstands need to be approved by the authorities. Ding Xiaozhe, 43, an accountant, said of the disappearance of newsstands near his home in Dongcheng district: ""It's a natural choice. Things that no longer fit with the times will be abandoned or fade away, which is reasonable."" Ding loves to read and was a loyal buyer of the magazines National Geographic and Chinese National Geography at newsstands. ""Every time I moved apartments, I had to carry several heavy boxes of my prized magazines,"" he said. ""I love good memories, but times change. We can read so much information on cellphones, and order digital magazines online. There's really no need to keep that many newsstands. Generally speaking, it's a waste of social resources to keep something that's old-fashioned."" Despite differing opinions about newsstands, the Beijing municipal government has decided to find a way to keep streets clean while allowing some of the stands to remain with upgraded facilities. In 2014, the central government outlined the capital's core functions as the country's political, cultural, international communications, and scientific and technological innovation center.,Since then, as an ancient and traditional city, Beijing has started to use its advantages to strengthen its position as a cultural center. Measures have been introduced to protect old streets and relics, build new cultural landmarks, improve the libraries' network and service, host cultural activities and provide subsidies to support bookstores. Meanwhile, in Russia, the government has drafted a plan, suggesting there should be a newsstand for every 1,500 residents. In Paris, the authorities have attempted to expand the business scope of newsstands and reduce rents to help the owners. They allow the stands to sell food, drinks, souvenirs and candies to increase income. In Japan, there are convenience stores on nearly every street. Each community has more than one such store, which sell newspapers and magazines. Wang Hui, 33, the mother of a 6-year-old boy in Beijing, said she often buys cartoon and other magazines at a newsstand for him on her way home. ""I want to protect his eyes by reducing the time he spends on his cellphone and other digital devices. He likes reading magazines. It's better to buy them at newsstands, because in that way I don't need to subscribe for a whole year,"" she said. ""I think that reading decides our kids' futures. No matter whether there are newsstands or other places selling newspapers and magazines, reading will always continue in some way."""
0,"BEIJING -- Beijing's sub-center, which will sit in the east of the capital, aims to accommodate 1.3 million permanent residents by 2035, according to a detailed plan published Thursday. The city sub-center will cover 155 square kilometers and be extended to the whole area of the current Tongzhou District, which totals about 906 square kilometers, according to the plan for the sub-center's development for 2016 to 2035, approved by the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council. The population density will be 9,000 residents per square kilometer at most so as to maintain a comfortable living environment, the document said. The plan pledged that the sub-center will be ""an urban area without urban ills,"" which will build an eco-friendly transport system focusing on public transport, adopt measures to control air, water and soil pollution, and develop strict management of water resources and intelligent urban management systems. ""The sub-center will not develop real estate projects on a large scale,"" the document said, adding that the market will play a decisive role in resource allocation. The plan also outlined the functions of the sub-center, measures for cultural development and coordinated development with surrounding areas in neighboring Hebei Province. Beijing is shifting some of its administrative functions out of the city center into Tongzhou to help address problems including traffic congestion and air pollution. The move is also part of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei integrated development plan. Beijing municipal government agencies have been moving their offices to Tongzhou since the end of 2017."
1,"Members of the 13th Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee have mooted the idea of a social credit evaluation system for the entertainment sector, as China steps up efforts to bring order to an industry that was rocked by plagiarism, tax evasion and payments to create fake fan followings in 2018. The social credit system, a unified system that ranks trustworthiness across several parameters, is likely to be rolled out nationally in 2020. There have already been suggestions by some of the members at the ongoing session of the 13th CPPCC National Committee that the entertainment sector needs to be brought under its ambit. Gong Hanlin, a well-known comedian and a CPPCC National Committee member, suggested a blacklist mechanism that would impose punishments for offenders, similar to the social credit system that seeks to prevent offenders from purchasing train or flight tickets. ""It is necessary to curb such behavior,"" Gong said. Gong was referring to many gray industries, such as follower buying, as pop stars' online influence can help attract numerous business opportunities, considering the purchasing power of their fans. Cai Xukun, a popular singer who has worked with numerous brands like Chanel, was reported by State broadcaster CCTV as one of those who have created huge fake online fan followings. His latest post featuring a new song on Weibo, one of China's most popular social media platforms, received about 100 million reposts. The number was roughly one-third of the Weibo users in total. Such activities have been mushrooming recently with the growing popularity of social media. Agents who can create fake fan followings are found everywhere, be it on Taobao or on WeChat. In a demonstration video by CCTV, they offer various services from basic packages of fake fans and reposts, to customized services. A basic package of 400 followers on Weibo and 100 shares only costs about 10 yuan ($1.5). ""Creating fake fan followings can have negative public influence,"" said Zhang Kaili, a well-known actress and CPPCC National Committee member. ""But public reaction on such misconduct has proved to be a more serious deterrent, though there is no regulatory punishment,"" she said. Zhai Tianlin, an actor, was charged with plagiarizing his academic dissertation during his graduate studies at Beijing Film Academy. This drew online criticism and even triggered public anger especially from those who are still struggling to get a doctoral degree. In the past, ""highly educated"" was one of Zhai's labels to attract a large fan base. Recent reports revealed that Zhai's business and filming opportunities have been hurt by the scandal. The Beijing Film Academy said in February that Zhai's suspected plagiarism was under investigation. Hou Guangming, the Party secretary of Beijing Film Academy and a CPPCC National Committee member, said that higher education of film professionals should be more comprehensive and go in parallel with the ongoing efforts to boost acting and direction talent."
0,"Younger students experience school bullying more frequently than older ones, and male students are bullied more than their female peers, a survey found.  The 21st Century Education Research Institute, a think tank in Beijing, surveyed 1,003 students from 12 schools in the city - four primary schools, four middle schools and four high schools.  It found that nearly half of students had been intentionally bumped or knocked down by classmates. About 6 percent said they are targeted by bullies on campus every day.  The survey also found that students from ordinary schools experienced more bullying than peers from key institutions, and children from poor families are more likely to be bullied at school.  Being bullied can have an adverse impact on a child's personal development and academic performance, according to Zhou Jinyan, a researcher who led the study at Beijing Normal University's Capital Institute for Economics of Education.  ""Children being bullied will find it hard to trust others,"" Zhou said. ""They may lack self-confidence and often feel anxiety, anger, resentment or depression. These emotions will further undermine their ability to control their own life.""  In recent years, bullying on Chinese campuses has been frequently reported and has attracted widespread attention and concern.  The most recent incident to trigger heated discussion took place in December at Beijing's prominent Zhongguancun No 2 Primary School. A fourth-grade student had a wastepaper basket from a bathroom thrown at him and was mocked by classmates, causing him acute stress disorder.  The Supreme People's Procuratorate, the top prosecuting authority, said in December that in the first 11 months of 2016 it received about 1,900 cases related to school bullying, leading to 1,100 arrests and 2,300 prosecutions.  Shi Weizhong, deputy director of the authority's Juvenile Procuratorial Affairs Office, said the vast majority of complaints filed with the authority involve male offenders, although the proportion of female offenders is rising.  Meanwhile, there was a notable increase in bullying reports involving middle school students 14 to 18 years old, he said.  Zhou came up with some ways to solve the problem, including boosting communication between teachers, parents and students and trying to establish more harmonious relationships among children.  She said it was ""strongly"" suggested that parents try to be involved in their children's educational experience, as their presence and companionship have proved effective in reducing bullying and its negative effects."
1,"China and the United States will implement the specific contents of the joint statement released on Saturday in Washington, covering the purchase of agricultural and energy products, the Ministry of Commerce said on Wednesday. It is one of China’s longstanding policies to expand imports to meet the growing demand of domestic consumers, as well as to boost high-quality economic development, a representative from the ministry said in a statement. US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross will visit China soon, according to the statement. China welcomes high-quality, competitive US products in the Chinese market, the ministry said, reiterating the economies of the two sides are highly complementary, and bilateral trade has vast potential to improve. In a joint statement released on Saturday, the two countries agreed to take measures to reduce the US trade deficit in goods, with China significantly increasing purchases of US goods and services, which will help support growth and employment in the US and meet the demand of China’s ongoing consumption upgrading. Wei Jianguo, a former vice-minister of commerce, said the two sides should strengthen trade cooperation in sectors that include energy and agricultural products, medical care, high-tech products and finance in an orderly manner. “China’s imports of US medical care and high-tech products are likely to surpass that of energy and agricultural products in terms of both value and variety,” he said. Lyu Xiang, a researcher at the Institute of World Economics and Politics of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said the settling down of the trade dispute also will help China build a better foundation to further support its ongoing industrial upgrading and catch up with more established foreign rivals in service businesses, he said. “Exporters from both sides are no longer in a rush to ship their goods to each other’s markets as negotiations gained a breakthrough in Washington last week,” said Li Guanghui, vice-president of the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation in Beijing. As the pillar industries among the US, the European Union and Japan are overlapping more, Li said high-tech US companies will have less concern about their previous market share being taken by European or Japanese companies in China."

Nine Chinese conductors who learned with or worked with maestro Li conducted at the event. Tang Muhai started the concert by conducting the first movement of   composed by Guan Xia, the head of the China National Symphony Orchestra. He was followed by Shao En conducting Beethoven's  which Li performed with the Central Orchestra in 1977, right after the end of the ""cultural revolution"" (1966-76). Then, Hu Yongyan conducted Mozart's  .  In 1999, Li conducted the CNSO featuring violinist Isaac Stern (1920-2001) in Beijing to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Stern's first trip to China.    In 1979, Stern became the first US musician to collaborate with the Central Symphony and teach master classes at Beijing's Central Conservatory of Music. The trip was covered in a documentary film,   and won the 1980 Academy Award for best documentary feature. Yu Long, arguably China's best-known conductor in the world nowadays, conducted Tchaikovsky's  . In January 1958, Li conducted the piece at his first concert with the CNSO after he returned from the Moscow Conservatory.   Born into an official's family in Beijing, Li started to learn music when he joined the school orchestra of Fu Jen Catholic University of Peking where he majored in history.  In 1940, he was admitted to the Shanghai Music Institute to learn the cello.  He went to study conducting at the Moscow Conservatory from 1953 to 1957. In the 1950s and '60s, he gave regular ""weekend concerts"" in Beijing to promote classical music. During the ""cultural revolution"", he initiated moves to make the yangbanxi (the eight revolutionary Peking Opera repertoire) into a symphonic piece to help the orchestra survive."
0,"Sinologists from 24 countries took a close look at China's development at a recent five-day symposium in Beijing. The event, which featured 28 Sinologists and 11 Chinese scholars, was an annual symposium jointly organized by China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism and the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. The annual event, which has been held since 2013, is a platform for academic exchanges and cooperation among overseas and domestic experts. Speaking at the symposium, Xie Jinying, the director of the bureau for external cultural relations of China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism, said: ""As this year marks the 40th anniversary of China's reform and opening-up policy, I hope the Sinologists can offer advice from diverse perspectives. ""We want to push forward communication and collaboration between the academic institutes in China and Sinologists from other countries."" The sessions at the event covered topics like prospects for international cooperation and the Belt and Road Initiative. Speaking at the event, Ole Doering, a professor at the Free University of Berlin, said that Europe and Asia should unite to build proper conditions for globalization by introducing a polycentric framework featuring cultural diversity. ""We can liberate the resources of creative humanism, as powerful narratives about truth, beauty and goodness beyond artificial boundaries,"" he said, adding that human values could be integrated through educating labor around the globe. Huang Ping, the director of the Institute of European Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that European and Chinese cultures emphasize the significance of people-to-people bonds, and that the Belt and Road Initiative could help to promote connectivity between Asia, Europe and Africa. Lious Kamwenubusa, the general director of Burundi's Press and Publication Bureau, said that China could play a role in building a world economic order and a global governance framework by using its status as the world's second largest economy. ""The Chinese government's proposal of a community with a shared future for all mankind has great significance for the global community, especially for my country Burundi,"" said Kamwenubusa. ""Both peace and prosperity are what my nation and its people need."" The symposium also had participants from the ongoing Beijing and Shanghai classes of the 2018 Visiting Program for Young Sinologists, which is also being run by the ministry. Lobzang Dorji, an associate lecturer from the Royal University of Bhutan, who is part of the program, said that the topics at the symposium could help his research on Sino-Indian relations and its impact on Bhutan because the basic prerequisite for his research is understanding China from a cultural and economic perspective, its social and political system and its foreign policies. ""I want to thank the organizers for accepting me, although China and Bhutan have not established diplomatic relations,"" he said. ""I think this kind of program is a catalyst for bridging the Sino-Bhutan relationship."""
1,"Capital force, such as venture capital and private equity funds, has played an important role in the internet industry's development both in China and the United States, said Li Ya, CEO of mobile news aggregator Yidianzixun. ""China's public market definitely wants these innovative companies to be listed domestically rather than going overseas for IPOs.""  Given this, China needs to accelerate the pace of opening up its domestic public trading market, which will further encourage innovations and help to introduce fair mechanisms for new companies to grow and compete in China, he told China Daily Website on Sunday in an interview on the sideline of the 4th World Internet Conference. The conference, which began on Sunday and ends on Tuesday, is underway in East China's water town of Wuzhen, Zhejiang province. In Li's view, internet is penetrating every dimension, every aspect of people's lives, and this phenomenon explained why Chinese government encourages the so-called the ""Internet Plus"" and internet of things. Meanwhile, China also decided to speed up AI development. In July, the State Council, or China's cabinet, articulated the country's AI development agenda, setting a goal of becoming the major artificial intelligence innovation center of the world by 2030. General Secretary Xi Jinping said in the report delivered at the opening of the 19th CPC National Congress that China will promote further integration of the internet, big data, and artificial intelligence with the real economy. As for AI development, Li said, ""in the next three to five years, people will be sure to feel the impact of the AI in their daily lives. I think one important thing is how we put human value in front of the machine algorithm, so that we can use the technology for good"". Established in 2012, Yidian positions itself as a media platform claiming to be based on a combination of machine recommendation and people's active expression of their interests.  The Beijing-based company has made further progress this year, including receiving the license for internet news information service, the first one issued since the related new regulations came into effect in June. The license will allow Yidian to gain competitive advantages over its peers, especially on content acquisition on its we-media platform Yidiaohao, the third quarter financial report of Phoenix New Media released in November showed. Li regarded the internet license as a unique opportunity for Yidian, as he quit ifeng.com in September and paid all his attention to Yidian.  ""We are in a very tough market and you have to concentrate in order to win the competition. And I think our users and our team, our coworkers and shareholders all demand the 100 percent concentration on Yidian."" Other progress is upgraded cooperation with smart phone makers - OPPO and Xiaomi, while Yidian also collaborated with universities for we-media training and made columns of Zhihu, a Chinese Q&A website, accessible on its platform. At the same time, the financial report also indicated that Yidian has gained investment of $112.1 million from Long De Cheng Zhang Culture Communication (Tianjin) Co and the other two investors, with an estimated transaction valuation of about $1 billion."

After landing her dream job of teaching at an elite school, the character is assigned to a class of defiant students who are isolated by the rest of the school, but she tries her best to help them find their true potential. Mykerji said at the Beijing event that she hopes the movie will raise public awareness of Tourette Syndrome, and will promote equality and inclusivity to those suffering with the disorder. Produced by Indian production company Yash Raj Films,   is imported by China Film Group Corporation and distributed by Huaxia Film Distribution. Following Mykerji's visit to Beijing, she also toured Shanghai and Shenzhen."
0,"A degree from a university overseas was once regarded as the calling card for better employment opportunities. However, graduates returning to China are now realizing that studying abroad no longer guarantees a well-paid job. Many are disappointed with the relatively low salaries and less competitive positions they are being offered as a result of the rising numbers of returnees and a surge in graduates from domestic institutions in recent years. The bad news for them is that competition is set to become even more cutthroat because China's universities are expected to produce a record 8.2 million graduates this year, according to the Ministry of Education. A recent report released by the Center for China and Globalization, a think tank in Beijing, shows that about 45 percent of graduate returnees are earning less than 6,000 yuan ($945) a month, while 23 percent make between 6,000 and 8,000 yuan. The salaries are chicken feed compared with the high cost of overseas study, which has risen to an average 300,000 yuan per annum as foreign universities look to earn extra revenue from international students, the report said. However, experts believe overseas education should not be viewed purely from the perspective of return on investment, because the experience can help students develop valuable, nonacademic skills. When Guo Shuai, 26, saw the Disney movie High School Musical as a middle school student, he became determined to study in the United States. Unlike the high-pressure, test-oriented school system with which he was familiar, the movie presented an alternative: a carefree atmosphere where students were independent and free to speak their minds, and enjoyed a wide range of social activities. So, when he graduated from Zhengzhou University in Henan province in June 2015, Guo did not hesitate to move to Fort Hays State University in Kansas to study for a master's in business administration. When he arrived, though, his rosy image of the US faded a little; the schedule at the university was much more intense than he had expected, and he found it difficult to blend in and make friends. Moreover, in addition to mid-term and final exams, set papers and tests were scheduled throughout the semester. ""I was almost fully occupied with the heavy workload at school, so I did not have much time to apply for internships,"" he said. When he returned to China, Guo found that his overseas degree did not make him stand out in the competitive job market. ""Since I had not applied for internships in the United States, the only thing that made me valuable to employers was my language skills."" He spent more than three months unemployed before securing a job as a translator at a financial company in Shanghai, earning about 8,000 yuan a month. Jiang Yuqiong, 25, had also harbored a dream of studying abroad since childhood, looking to broaden her horizons and see the world. She also hoped that an overseas degree would give her an edge in the domestic job market. However, when she finished a master's in accounting and finance at Durham University in the United Kingdom last year, she discovered that her qualification actually made her less competitive than graduates from schools in China. She applied to the auditing departments at the ""Big Four"" accountancy firms－KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte and Ernst & Young－but didn't receive any replies, let alone job offers. ""In my opinion, the big four prefer students with bachelor's degrees for those jobs because they can pay them less,"" she said. After spending the ""longest"" four months doubting her abilities and the value of her education, Jiang finally landed a job as a consultant at a multinational management company in Shanghai, earning more than 10,000 yuan a month.,Neither Guo nor Jiang regrets studying overseas, despite the heavy financial burden－Guo paid 400,000 yuan for his two-year program, while Jiang's 12 months of study cost 300,000 yuan－because they hoped the experience would help them earn decent salaries in their first jobs. However, for Liu Zeyang, overseas study came at a much higher cost. In 2013, Liu quit his studies at Wuhan University during his sophomore year, because he felt the school was not offering him the quality of education he had expected. He persuaded his parents to send him to the US to attend a pre-university language school. Following that, he moved to the University of Maryland where he majored in finance, a field his family thought would help him secure a good job. To help fund his studies, his parents sold a property they owned and gave him more than 1 million yuan. ""Knowing that my parents had sold the property, my feelings were complicated; I told myself that I must study hard to repay their sacrifice,"" the 24-year-old said. However, he was not interested in finance and found the course too demanding and stressful. ""After three semesters at the university, I applied to postpone my graduation and returned to Beijing last year."" After he returned, Liu worked for two startups, but he quit his jobs to start a business selling healthy meals to people who want to lose weight. Xiong Bingqi, deputy director of the 21st Century Education Research Institute in Beijing, said China's economic growth and rising household incomes mean more parents are willing to send their children overseas to study. ""Going abroad to study is no longer just for the elite,"" he said. According to a survey of 6,217 people who plan to study overseas, conducted by Vision Overseas Consulting Co and Kantar Millward Brown, the students' main objectives are to broaden their horizons and gain a wide range of experience. The survey found that 73 percent of respondents plan to return to China after graduation, while 40 percent simply want to enhance their resumes. Ministry of Education data show that in 2007, only 44,000 people returned to China after studying overseas, but last year, the number had risen to 480,900. However, the number of people choosing to study abroad during the same period only rose from 144,000 to 608,400, according to the ministry. Shi Yan, of the Chivast Education International consultancy in Beijing, said more people are returning to China because they are finding it difficult to land jobs overseas and the domestic employment market is more appealing. However, she added that one of the biggest obstacles to securing a job is that they miss the prime job-seeking season. ""In China, the job-seeking season for graduates starts in October or November, which is when most employers start accepting resumes and doing interviews,"" she said. ""However, most Chinese students studying overseas will only graduate and be ready to apply for jobs in May."" Zhao Hongxue, a senior human resources expert at Huicai International Management Consulting in Beijing, said finding a job has not been easy in recent years because of the rising number of students graduating from domestic universities. The deeper talent pool means businesses are now paying more attention to the personalities and abilities of prospective employees, regardless of academic status or family background, and irrespective of whether they are domestic students, graduates returning from overseas or expats, she said. However, overseas study still provides returnees with one advantage, according to Zhao－their experience tends to make them more independent and equips them with a global mindset and better communication skills, which are all important for future promotion opportunities."

Due to stricter environmental regulations in Beijing's Yanqing district, he'd had to sell his entire flock of sheep - more than 300 - for just 330 yuan ($50) a head, far lower than the 1,300 yuan he'd paid for them two years earlier. Yet he was soon lifted from despair by a trailer promoting the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, which inspired him to organize a ski and snowboard team composed primarily of pastoral farmers. With the hillsides free of sheep manure and the grass rejuvenated from a reduction in grazing, Zhangshanying town broke ground on the Winter Olympics Forest Park, a winter sports-themed construction project. The development has proved transformative for many local young people. ""The town Party secretary told me not to feel sad about the loss of my sheep and urged me to consider doing something else,"" Lang, 28, said. ""The idea of establishing a ski team struck me, and I decided to organize one before the Winter Olympics."" He said children in Zhangshanying were accustomed to helping with small tasks for the nearby Shiqinglong ski resort from an early age, ""so people in the town who could ski generally had an average of 10 years' experience"". Haituo ski team, also known as the ""farmer ski team"", was established on Sept 11, comprising 18 members with an average age of 26. ""Skiing is like a natural skill for us,"" Lang said. ""But after our ski team was set up, our skiing skills have become more professional."" On Dec 14, 11 members of the team were offered an opportunity to train with the Swiss Ski Association in Beijing, with qualified skiers earning first-level teaching certificates to help pass on their talents. Earlier this year the team went to Jilin province to hone their skills under the guidance of China's national ski team. Over several months, the Haituo team members have developed a series of new methods to teach aspiring students how to best traverse the slopes. ""You can't use many professional words to teach children how to ski, but we just need to use more familiar descriptions such as 'stand on your snowboards like you're leveling the frosting on a cake' to better relate to young students,"" said Yan Qingsheng, 23, one of the team members. The number of trainee candidates for the ski team has surged to 5,000. ""I hope people who go skiing in Yanqing can stay on for more coaching, and a larger skiing population will be created,"" Yan said. ""The Beijing Winter Olympics are also a great opportunity for Zhangshanying and the villagers,"" he added. ""But if skiing infrastructure is fully set up and no one comes to ski, the whole idea will be invalidated."" For former shepherd Lang, doing his best to make the 2022 Beijing Games a success is his Olympic dream. ""When the ski trails are completed, we hope to help athletes do something with their skis and snowboards to more actively participate in the Winter Olympics,"" he said. xinwen@chinadaily.com.cn"
0,"BEIJING - Beijing's historic north-south Zhongzhouxian, the central axis, is to apply for World Heritage status in 2035, the municipal administration of cultural heritage said Wednesday. Fourteen historical places along the axis, including Qianmen, the Forbidden City, Jingshan Park, the Drum and Bell Towers, Chairman Mao Zedong Memorial Hall, the Monument to the People's Heroes and Tian'anmen Square have been identified as the key heritage sites. Preservation work of these sites should meet the requirements of the application by 2030, said Shu Xiaofeng, director of the administration. First created in the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368), the original Zhongzhouxian was 3.7 kilometers. The Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties extended the length to 7.8 kilometers from Yongdingmen in the south to the Drum and Bell Towers in the north. Situated at the city's center, Zhongzhouxian separates the districts of Dongcheng and Xicheng. ""It is like the backbone of Beijing's urban spacial structure,"" said Beijing historian Li Jianping. Beijing authorities earlier unveiled a general plan for the development of the Zhongzhouxian from 2016 to 2035. A plan to prepare the Zhongzhouxian for its World Heritage application is now being made. ""The application aims to better protect the city's history and culture,"" said Shu."
0,"Beijing has named 52 primary and secondary schools as the first batch targeted to bring winter sports onto campuses ahead of the 2022 Winter Olympic Games in China. According to the Beijing Municipal Commission of Education, nearly 140,000 students have taken skating and skiing lessons in the past two years. The authority will cooperate with the capital's Sports Bureau to design winter sports syllabuses and in giving professional instruction to students. In Chaoyang district, related curricula have been set up in six primary and secondary schools, according to the commission. The city government will give further support to winter sports by providing financial backing this year. Thirty-one pilot schools in Haidian district opened up winter sports curricula. A school in northwestern Beijing, Dongbeiwang Central Primary School, has included floor hockey－an ice-free version of ice hockey－into their school sports curriculum. The city will also establish high-level school clubs to promote the popularity of winter sports. The authority also advised building more ski runs based on seasonal features and site conditions. In Haidian and Yanqing districts, schools are being encouraged to create outdoor ice rinks when winter weather conditions allow, while in summer, synthetic ice was a good choice for campuses to open up skating practice curricula. The advanced winter sport teaching facilities were also discussed as school options to address the difficulty of promoting winter sports on campus, according to the commission. Beijing will put more effort into raising the number of qualified winter sports instructors, improve school curriculum designs and hasten construction of winter sports venues to add more flavor to the upcoming Winter Olympics in China, the commission added."
0,"HELSINKI - A key ceremonial segment of Helsinki was converted on Monday night into a ""cultural China world"" in a joint celebration of the Chinese New Year by the cities of Helsinki and Beijing and the Finland-China Society. This was the 13th time that the Chinese New Year has been celebrated out in the open in the Finnish capital, with emphasis on the outreach to Finnish population. This year the event occupied the prestigious Civic Square opposite the parliament building. Pang Wei, deputy director of Beijing's Municipal Bureau of Culture and Tourism and head of the Chinese delegation for the event, described the the evening as exchange of heart and feelings. Talking to Xinhua, she noted that although it is really cold outside, the people are showing the passion. ""They really appreciate Chinese culture"". With the clock approaching six p.m. in Helsinki, or midnight in Beijing, Jan Vapaavuori, mayor of Helsinki, and Chen Li, Chinese Ambassador to Finland, addressed the crowds. Chen noted that the square the event took place is called ""People's square"". It represents the fact that Chinese new year is not only a traditional festival for the Chinese, but also an urban festival for the city of Helsinki. Chen recalled the recent visit to China by Finnish President Sauli Niinisto and the joint action plan approved. He noted in particular the ongoing winter sports year of China and Finland. Vapaavuori said the Chinese New Year celebration brings joy and life to wintery Helsinki. ""It is always a happy event. Since its first edition it has grown into a major event."" The program at the Civic Square included, among others, Kun opera, dancing, musical performance and Chinese martial arts. CHINESE PICKED UP AT EARLY AGE Among the many small exhibits offered as part of the event, Jenny Law, the co-owner of a new day care operation ""Little heroes"", told Xinhua their day care center offers tuition in mandarin, although the main language is English. She believed they are the first day care center to offer Chinese. They have children between the ages of one and five. The Helsinki public primary school system is offering Chinese now as one of nine languages from the first school year. Delegation head Pang said she had been particularly delighted with a special performance arranged on Monday morning for pre-school age children. ""We had 3-to-5 year olds watching the program. I am really happy they start learning Chinese culture at an early age"". The Finland-China Society has been an organizer of the Chinese New Year in Finland from the start. Enthusiast Leena Vilponen had traveled to Helsinki for the event from the west coast town of Pori. She said it is the Chinese culture that attracts her, adding that the local chapter of the society in Pori has been arranging its own New Year events as well. HARD-WORKING CHINESE POPULAR IN FINLAND This year's event was preceded by Finnish media focus on the popularity of the Chinese immigrants have gained and also maintained in Finland in recent years. In a large feature, Sami Sillanpaa, a correspondent at Helsingin Sanomat, noted that while attitudes towards immigrants in Finland have hardened in general in recent years, the Chinese have maintained their good reputation. ""They give their contribution to society and do not cause problems. That is just what is expected from the newcomers,"" Sillanpaa wrote. Pang said she had not heard about that discussion but said that evening during a short visit she could see that Finns and Chinese get on well. At the end of 2017, there were 12,000 Chinese speakers in Finland, including Cantonese speakers as well. Chinese are the fourth largest foreign ethnic group in Finland."

The event took place at the Beijing Confucian Temple, where emperors from the Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties used to go to remember Confucius. Some of the guests took part in traditional rites to remember Confucius. Born in 551 BC, Confucius, a well-known Chinese philosopher and the founder of Confucian culture, has his birthday marked for more than 2,000 years. Yang Yuedi, a student of the Confucius class from the Beijing 21st Century International School, took part in the ceremony for the first time. ""I learned about benevolence and righteousness, respect, and kindheartedness from Confucius' thoughts, and I'm trying to be a gentleman like Confucius,"" said Yang, the 5th grade student. Dong Ting, the deputy secretary-general of the China Next Generation Education Foundation Chinese Study Education Research and Development Foundation, has been a volunteer at the ceremony since 2010. ""I felt honored to take part in the ceremony in 2010, and I've decided to follow Chinese culture since then,"" Dong said. Now as the vice-president of the Eastern School, Dong brought students and their parents to the ceremony this year. ""I'd like to help develop and expand Chinese traditional culture."" The ceremony was also the closing event of the 21-day sixth edition of the Beijing Confucian Temple Guozijian Chinese Studies Cultural Festival."
1,"BEIJING - The United States violated World Trade Organization (WTO) rules and its own public commitment by launching a Section 301 investigation unilaterally and threatening punitive tariffs against China, according to the Chinese Ministry of Commerce Tuesday. In accordance with the WTO rules, its members are forbidden to unilaterally assume when others break WTO rules and are not allowed to unilaterally stop tariff concessions or other obligations without WTO authorization. Meanwhile, the United States has breached its own public commitment made in the Statement of Administrative Action in 1994. The statement declared that the US trade representative should decide that its rights under the WTO framework are infringed only based on the decision of the WTO dispute settlement mechanism. The United States on April 3 announced tariffs on a proposed list of Chinese goods worth $50 billion, covering industries in aerospace, information and communication technology, robotics and machinery. The list was authorized by the US Trade Representative's office, which in August 2017 initiated an unfounded investigation under the Section 301 of the US Trade Act of 1974 to probe China's intellectual property and technology transfer practices."
1,"A new type of subway train, which is expected to run between downtown Beijing and the Daxing international airport that is under construction south of the city, will offer passengers a unique experience thanks to cutting-edge technology and design. The train launched its first trial run on Saturday in Beijing, its developer CRRC Qingdao Sifang Co said on Monday. The trains are named after ""Baijing"", or ""White whale"", and each features the world's most advanced fully-automatic driving system that not only allows driverless operation but enables the vehicle to wake up, self-check and go dormant automatically, according to Liu Jiangtao, a senior designer of CRRC Qingdao. ""The system liberates human labor from routines such as daily examinations ... and it also enables the trains to establish arrival times more precisely,"" Liu added. Liu said that each train's structure is made mainly of extruded aluminum with several hollow cavities. This means the train is resistant to air loss, so passengers feel less vibration and hear less noise. Each train is designed to run at a speed of 160 kilometers per hour, and it will take about 20 minutes to get from Caoqiao, one of the subway stations in southern Beijing's Fengtai district, to the new airport, covering 41.3 kilometers. The Beijing Daxing International Airport, at the junction of Beijing's Daxing district and Langfang, a city in neighboring Hebei province, is designed to take pressure off the overcrowded Beijing Capital International Airport in the northeastern suburbs. The trains, as well as Beijing's airport subway line, are expected to go into formal operation with the new airport in September. Liu said the trains' interior design follows aviation standards and is divided into a business-class carriage, six regular carriages and one for luggage, with a maximum passenger capacity of 448. Passengers will feel more comfortable as the size and spacing of seats are wider than in China's Fuxing bullet trains, Liu said. There are also USB charging ports at the seats and luggage racks between carriages. Liu said that the trains are part of a series designed for intercity and metropolitan transportation by CRRC Qingdao, with speeds ranging from 100 to 200 kilometers per hour. This series of trains will also run on several other lines in China that connect a major city to suburban areas or neighboring cities, according to Liu."

""China has been the priority on educational collaboration. ... That means we are still looking for an increase, not only in terms of numbers (of Chinese students studying in the Netherlands) but also for a sharper focus on quality,"" Pulles told Xinhua after the Orange Tulip Scholarship award ceremony in Beijing on June 29. ""This year marks the 10th anniversary of the OTS scholarships in China. The past decade has seen remarkable growth in the scholarship program,"" he said. In 2008, the value of OTS scholarships available to students on the Chinese mainland was about 10,000 euros ($11,572) offered by one Dutch institute for higher education. In 2018, this total had reached nearly 770,000 euros offered by 20 Dutch institutes for higher education, according to Nuffic Neso China. Headquartered in The Hague, Nuffic is a Dutch organization for internationalization in education, which has 11 offices around the world, including one in Beijing. Pulles said educational cooperation between the Netherlands and China has continued to maintain momentum, adding that universities interested in collaborating in the fields of science and research visit the Dutch embassy every week. There are more than 200 partnerships between the two countries in higher education and 30 partnerships in secondary education, according to Nuffic Neso China. Overseas students from China and the Netherlands are acting as informal ambassadors to strengthen mutual understanding and foster friendship between the two countries, Pulles said. The Netherlands is a good place for Chinese students to pursue their studies abroad, and the country is friendly to foreign students due to the open-mindedness of the Dutch people and their willingness to understand different cultures and lifestyles, he said. ""Holland is the 17th largest economy in the world. Some of the world's biggest multinationals, including Philips, Heineken, KLM, Shell, ING and Unilever, are Dutch,"" he said. ""International graduates can apply for a one-year residence permit to help them find a job or start a business."" Pulles advised Chinese students to participate in university and community activities, like voluntary work and students associations, and to make friends with international students. Over 8,000 Chinese students are studying in the Netherlands, representing the second biggest group of international students there. There are around 2,000 Dutch students currently in China. ""I think studying in China is attractive, because China will become so important. ... If you look to the future as a young (Dutch) student, I would say you should spend some time in China, because sooner or later it will become useful for your career,"" Pulles said. ""The educational levels of universities in China are increasing rapidly. ... You can find good education here."" The China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative will also provide more opportunities for bilateral educational cooperation, Pulles added."
0,"China will operate more ""Fuxing"" bullet trains everyday as a new train diagram will be put into operation beginning April 10. According to China Railway Corp, the national railway operator, China will begin carrying out the new train diagram with adjustments to routes, speeds and train numbers. The diagram shows that eight pairs of ""Fuxing"" bullet trains traveling at a speed of 350 kilometers per hour will be added to the Beijing - Shanghai railway. The total number of ""Fuxing"" bullet trains running every day across the country will reach 114.5 pairs, linking 23 municipalities and provincial capitals. The ""Fuxing"" train, also known as ""Rejuvenation"", is a new bullet train model mainly developed based on China's railway standards and technologies, and aims to adapt to China's environment and rail transport patterns. The adoption of ""Fuxing"" trains in June has shortened the Beijing-Shanghai travel time to 4 hours and 24 minutes. After the new diagram is put into operation, the travel time between Beijing and Shanghai will be further reduced to 4 hours and 18 minutes. Travel time between Beijing and Hangzhou, and between Beijing and Hefei will be cut by 36 and 20 minutes respectively, according to China Railway Corp. More express and large cargo freight trains, such as China Railway Express, a freight train between China and Europe, and freight trains to transport coal, will be added, too. The trains are expected to transport an extra of 200 million metric tons of coal thanks to the enhancement of the transport capacity, according to the China Railway Corp."

Five-meter-high waterfall, a pond rippling with reed and flutes of luminous champagne, the magical   art exhibition at downtown Beijing's Lang Yuan Vintage park touches the hearts of a wider public. The event, named after the  fable by ancient Chinese poet Tao Yuanming, forges a spectacle where every visitor will explore an ethereal place entirely detached from modern civilization and experience the wonderful harmony between man and nature. The whole space of   glitters with water imageries. Visitors may dare through the waterfalls or simply stroll around this dreamy place. ""It is like reopening a world forgotten by human beings,"" Jean-Charles Penot, artist of the show, said to China Daily website. ""A long time ago, people still visited this cave which is connected by nature. Today we reopen this door so people can reexplore the genesis of life with the power of water and how water brings life and hope to people."" Growing up in a coastal town near Bordeaux of France, Penot was deeply influenced by his grandfather and became a nature lover himself. ""He taught me to grow vegetables, showed me the beauty of the forest, names of every single plant,"" Penot said. ""My grandpa taught me how to respect nature and how nature will always give you back."" An illustration book in his grandfather's collection guided Penot to the expeditions around China. ""I imagined myself coming to China to work on these amazing architectures with so much harmony with the landscape. This was why I decided to come here,"" he said. Fascinated by the scenery and exotic experiences at remote ethnic villages in Southwest China, the artist would stay weeks with villagers, learning local traditions and ways of living. ""All the time I had with Yao people and Blang people gives me the inspiration that I try to bring back to Beijing."",For Penot, Chinese ethnic culture is an inexhaustible source of new ideas. The culinary installation  derives from his latest trip to Blang people in Yunnan. ""Our food is connected with the landscape,"" the artist said. ""We now have no idea where our food comes from, who grew it on which landscape,"" he said referring to the problem faced by most city dwellers. ""If we have this beauty as these people in the village [which is] to know the source of our food, we will eat better, and meanwhile, better preserve the environment."" By combining videos, lighting, installation art and gastronomy, Penot tends to make the theme more accessible to not merely art lovers. ""I try to connect people who don't go to art galleries. It's more difficult to get them interested to see an exhibition."" He also sees the profound significance of building the bond between children and nature, especially in Chinese urban regions. ""Kids now in Beijing were born in the city. A 6-year-old may not even touch mud. It is almost a duty to convey this message, in an artistic way, that to reconnect with nature."" On the opening day of the exhibition, children were invited to see this immersive art show and create wall paintings with chromatic highlighters. The exhibition will run until June 19. As a major art zone in CBD Beijing, Lang Yuan Vintage has been launching a wide range of activities for city residents, including an upcoming handicraft fair during the Dragon Boat Festival holiday."
0,"An automated high-speed railway line linking Beijing and Zhangjiakou, host cities of the 2022 Winter Olympics, will be tested in 2019, said its manufacturer on Thursday. ""The fully automated train will be built using environment friendly materials,"" said Wang Run, a deputy to the 13th National People's Congress and chairman of CRRC Changchun Railway Vehicles Co. The 174-kilometer intercity railroad is a high-speed rail line, with a designed speed up to 350 km/h. Construction work on the line began in April 2016 and is expected to be completed by the end of 2019. There are 10 stations along the line, under the government plan. Travel time between Beijing to Zhangjiakou in Hebei province will be shortened from the current three-odd hours to within an hour after the trains start normal operations. Wang said the new carriages can save more than 7.5 percent of the energy consumed to power the trains presently. It will complete its trial run on a route linking Beijing and Shenyang in Liaoning province in the summer of next year. The new trains are designed specifically for viewers and athletes to travel between Beijing and Zhangjiakou during the Winter Olympics in 2022 and also have a media carriage with Wi-Fi service and TV screens for live broadcasting, an athlete drug-testing area and a storage area for winter sports equipment. ""The Olympic trains will be more intelligent and environment-friendly than the Fuxing (Rejuvenation) bullet trains that were put into operation on the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed rail line in September last year,"" said Feng Hao, a researcher at the Institute of Comprehensive Transportation at the National Development and Reform Commission. Wang Dujuan, another NPC deputy and chief engineer of China Railway Hi-Tech Industry Co, said the 2022 Winter Olympics will offer a unique platform for China to showcase its high-speed train manufacturing technologies, related services and supporting facilities to global visitors and potential clients from the government and private sector. She said the railroad can still transport people to take part in various winter sport activities in Zhangjiakou after the Games, as well as support coordinated development of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei. CRRC Changchun shipped metro trains for the Rio Olympics in Brazil and operated the system for the duration of the Games in 2016. Wang, from CRRC Changchun, said the smart train is also designed to run on different line gauges, meaning it could meet the demands of running between China and other countries and regions related to the Belt and Road Initiative."
0,"Re-TROS, a Chinese post-punk rock band based in Beijing, will launch a tour in North America, as it strives for increased global recognition  Chinese band Re-TROS made its debut in the United Kingdom in May. On the first night, it performed at The Cavern, a small nightclub in Liverpool, where the Beatles used to play regularly.  Then three days later, it performed at the Liverpool Sound City  a major annual event of Liverpool.  ""We experienced a different atmosphere at each venue. It felt great,"" says Hua Dong, the band's lead vocalist and guitarist, adding that at the festival, he met some of his favorite musicians, such as John Cale, one of the founding members of the legendary rock band Velvet Underground.  ""I saw many elder people wearing T-shirts with images of Velvet Underground at the festival - which is different from China. In China, outdoor music festivals are packed with young people.""  Re-TROS, short for Rebuilding the Rights of Statues, is a post-punk rock band based in Beijing, which was founded by Hua Dong in 2003.  Hua, who was born in Nanjing, in East China's Jiangsu province, gave up studying German at the M in Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg, in Leipzig, to focus on his music.  The band has a sizable fan base in China thanks to its music, a combination of post-punk beats and synthesizers. This April, it toured more than 20 Chinese cities.      Since 2006, the band has been performing abroad including Helsinki, in Finland.  In 10 days, the band will give seven shows in Chicago, Boston, Toronto and Montreal, as it promotes its upcoming album titled Before the Applause.  The band's debut album, Watch Out! Climate Has Changed, Fat Mum Rises ... was released eight years ago. And the single, Cut Off! was released in 2005.  With its new album, the band aims to showcase change.  ""This album is different from our post-punk music. We listen to various kinds of music and experiment. We have a new drummer, who brought us fresh and exciting ideas.  ""The process of making this album was long, and at certain point we had no idea where we were heading.  ""But this new album showcases what has inspired us during the past eight years,"" says Hua.  A 12-minute single from the album, At MOSP Here, was released early this year.  One of the key forces behind the band's international expansion is Modern Sky, China's biggest indie music label, which Re-TROS signed with in 2005.  This March, Shen Lihui, the founder of Modern Sky, announced the launch of Modern Sky UK in Liverpool in collaboration with David Pichilingi, who has over 25 years experience in the international music business, and is the founder of Sound City.  The UK venture is the second overseas office of Modern Sky.  In 2006, the label opened its first overseas office in New York.  Pichilingi, who was very impressed by the Chinese artists at the Modern Sky and Strawberry Music festivals held in Beijing in 2016, says: ""The diversity is strong.""  Speaking about the band's forays abroad, Hua says: ""The overseas events are massive opportunities for Chinese bands to be seen by audiences worldwide. For Re-TROS, we want to have regular tours abroad, such as to the UK and the United States, which will enable us to keep a constant link with our fans abroad."""
0,"The International Center for Theoretical Physics – Asia Pacific has opened in Beijing, giving a fillip to scientific research and collaboration in the Asia-Pacific region. “Setting up this institute is a worthy idea,” said Professor Chen-Ning Yang, a joint winner of the Nobel Prize in physics in 1957 and a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, at the inauguration ceremony on May 13 for the International Center for Theoretical Physics – Asia Pacific. The center, a nonprofit organization located on the campus of the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, aims to promote scientific research in the region and is recruiting researchers from home and abroad. The International Center for Theoretical Physics, a research institute that runs under the auspices of UNESCO, was founded in Trieste, Italy, in 1964, after a proposal by Abdus Salam, a Pakistani theoretical physicist who was a joint winner of the Nobel Prize in physics in 1979. Established six months ago, the new regional organization operates jointly with the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. It was set up with the support of UNESCO in conjunction with the academy, the National Science Foundation China and the Abdus Salam International Center for Theoretical Physics in Trieste. Professor Quevedo Fernando of the University of Cambridge, director of the International Center for Theoretical Physics, said the center’s mission is to promote the development of science and benefit more people. The new regional offshoot will contribute to fulfilling this mission, he said. Professor Xie Xincheng, a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and deputy head of the National Science Foundation China, said the International Center for Theoretical Physics – Asia Pacific will function as a platform for young scientists to learn from each other, broaden their networks, enhance their research ability and disseminate the results of their research. Those in attendance at the opening ceremony included scholars and professors of physics from Hong Kong and Beijing, students from the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and staff of the International Center for Theoretical Physics – Asia Pacific."
0,"The Palace Museum in Beijing has teamed up with Chinese Internet giant Tencent to launch its first music album, which ties in with 11 of the most famous paintings in the museum's collection. Shan Jixiang, the curator of the museum, which is also known as the Forbidden City, called the event Ancient Paints Can Sing ""a wonderful hyperlink"". In the collaboration, the museum presented 11 masterpieces, including the scroll   by Song Dynasty artist Zhang Zeduan (1085–1145) and   by Gu Kaizhi (c. 345–406), as the inspiration. Tencent's musical arm invited public contributions of original music to accompany the paintings, while the museum's scholars provided literarary background and veteran musicians helped select the best musical creations. ""The Forbidden City is the carrier of traditional culture and embodies the wisdom and creativity of the Chinese. It is the most important duty of the Palace Museum to explore and spread the spiritual wealth,"" Shan said. The museum aims to further integrate new technologies into their collections to help make traditional culture more engaging, Shan said. The Palace Museum and Tencent formally established a partnership in July 2016 to promote the integration of traditional culture and digital creativity. The museum aims to increase its attraction and influence among tech-savvy young people through the application of games, cartoons, music, apps, artificial intelligence and cloud computing."
1,"As the global telecommunications community scrambles to commercialize fifth-generation wireless technology, more efforts are needed to ensure that data is safely stored, analyzed and used to prepare for a 5G-enabled world, tech tycoons said at the ongoing China Development Forum in Beijing. ""If a computer is the brain, 5G is the nervous system, data is the blood, and memory, as well as storage, is very much the heart of all these things,"" said Sanjay Mehrotra, president and CEO of Micron Technology Inc, a memory-chip manufacturer from the United States. ""More data will be created by billions of devices, and it has to be analyzed and processed quickly. That all happens in the memory and storage devices that Micron makes, and that provides deeper insight for the experiences of human life as well as for businesses,"" he said at the weekend. He added that 5G will reshape people's daily lives and business operations, making remote surgeries and self-driving vehicles a reality. To realize such potential, efforts are needed to ensure that data is safely and efficiently stored and processed. As one of the world's largest makers of memory chips, Micron has been in China for more than a decade. With about 3,700 employees in the country, it has an engineering center in Shanghai and a chip packaging and testing plant in Xi'an, capital of Shaanxi province. To offer better localized products and services, Micron also has sales, marketing and customer labs in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, Guangdong province. Yang Yuanqing, chairman and CEO of Lenovo Group, the world's largest manufacturer of personal computers, said 5G will play a direct role in fueling the development of the digital economy and also ignite a cross-sector creativity boom. ""Traditional sectors need to pounce on the opportunities brought by 5G to upgrade themselves and create greater dividends by significantly boosting efficiency,"" he said. Yang added that the ""intelligent era"" will be driven by three key elements - data, strong computing power and algorithms - and next-generation, superfast technology will affect all three. ""About half of the 5G applications will be about its integration with traditional sectors,"" he said. Wu Manqing, general manager of China Electronics Technology Group Corp, a State-owned company, said efforts will be needed to help people better understand what the new 5G era will mean. ""A 5G-enabled world could be either extremely big or small. With tons of faster connections, our network will grow increasingly large and we will pursue more connections. On the other hand, we may go increasingly deeper to explore just one or two connections, which may make our world smaller,"" he said. According to Wu, 5G will also feature interaction between the physical and digital worlds, and efforts will be required to ease pressures on people and their fear of the unknown. A report from the Global System for Mobile Communications Association, which represents the interests of mobile operators worldwide, predicts that China will become the world's largest 5G market by 2025. With an expected 460 million users of the next-generation, superfast network, user numbers will surpass those in Europe (205 million) and the United States (187 million) combined, the report said. Mats Granryd, the association's director-general, said that after spending billions (of dollars) in the past decade deploying 4G networks to all corners of the country, Chinese mobile operators are now set to invest a further $58 billion over the next two years to prepare for and begin the rollout of the 5G network."
0,"China will push for legislation on preschool education to regulate teacher behavior and standardize the operation of such institutions, Vice-Minister of Education Tian Xuejun said on Thursday.  ""We are conducting research to introduce a preschool law, and have started the procedure to push for the legislation,"" he said during a news conference in Beijing.  He made the remark after a series of abuse scandals in kindergartens across the country that caused great harm to minors' physical and mental health.  ""I am deeply saddened about the child abuse cases. Such incidents have exposed some problems, including poor management and loose supervision in the preschool system,"" he said.  ""Speeding up the legislation... will offer a legal guarantee when setting up kindergartens and regulating the management of such institutions,"" he said.  In one recent case, parents said their children were abused at an RYB Education kindergarten in Chaoyang district in Beijing. Police investigated and accused one female teacher of using sewing needles to ""discipline"" children who didn't take a nap.  The 22-year-old teacher, surnamed Liu, was detained under criminal law by police and the kindergarten apologized for the incident.  Beijing's education department has ordered tighter management of preschools, especially in improving moral codes of conduct applied to teachers. Three Chaoyang education officers have been investigated for weak supervision of private kindergartens, according to Beijing police.  Tian said the case has exposed the conflict between the public demand for and insufficient development of preschool education.  He said education departments will formulate strong supervision measures and beef up investigations to keep kindergartens operating legally, then improve the quality of instruction.  Zheng Xinjian, director of juvenile prosecution under the Supreme People's Procuratorate, said that to tackle the issue, prosecutors will severely punish those who harm minors' rights and compromise safety at schools or kindergartens.  Prosecutors will be sent to schools and kindergartens to publicize the laws, especially to raise the awareness of teachers and kindergarten managers."
0,"All primary school and kindergarten teachers in Beijing will be required to receive 40 hours of training on the core values of Chinese socialism and traditional Chinese culture by 2020, the city's education commission announced. As a pilot program, teachers from six schools in Doncheng and Tongzhou districts will be the first to receive the training, starting in November, the Beijing Municipal Commission of Education said. The training sessions will include courses on traditional culture and crafts. All courses will be given online and via mobile applications. All teachers must complete the 40-hour training sessions by 2020. To better educate children, the teachers must be better educated first. Also, a teacher must have deep affection for traditional culture, said Li Yi, the commission's deputy director. The courses are all online so the teachers can be flexible. The commission will monitor teachers' progress in completing the training sessions and see if they've done their homework, Li said. It also will analyze which sessions receive more hits so the content can be better adjusted in the future. The increasing proportion of ancient Chinese literature in the curriculum echoes the Ministry of Education's efforts to raise awareness of traditional culture among primary and middle school students. Students who begin Grade 1 in September will find ancient Chinese literature and science in their textbooks the first time such material has been introduced to new students since the establishment of the People's Republic of China. According to education authorities, the set of Chinese language textbooks for the six primary grades contain 132 works of ancient Chinese literature, taking up about 30 percent of the content of each textbook. That's an increase of 80 percent over the set of textbooks previously published by People's Education Press, a publishing company under the Ministry of Education. Education Minister Chen Baosheng pledged in March to boost students' knowledge of traditional Chinese culture, and one of the measures was to design suitable textbooks."
0,"As one of 13 pilot cities in a nationwide housing reform, Beijing has planned to supply a total of 1,000 hectares of rural collective land for constructing residential buildings for rent by 2021. At present, the Beijing government has signed contracts with villages and companies on construction work expected to start soon on some pieces of collective land, Economic Information Daily reported. In July last year, the central government chose 13 cities including Beijing, Shanghai and Shenyang to carry out pilot reform of building residential buildings for rent on collective land. Beijing had arranged 204 hectares of collective construction land by the end of last year, said Guan Aijun, an official from Beijing Municipal Commission for City Planning and Land Resources Management. Another 200 hectares will be added in 2018, he said. In addition to Beijing, other pilot cities are also stepping up exploration. Chengdu in Southwest China's Sichuan province, for instance, has launched a total of five pilot projects. Some experts said with the continuous progress of urbanization, housing demand in China's cities — especially megacities — continues to grow. The pilot reform will help solve the housing problem for migrant workers and improve the economic and social environment in suburbs. At the same time, the reform has also widened channels for collective economic organizations and farmers to increase their income, so farmers can obtain long-term and stable benefits, experts said."

The event will begin in Hunan and Shaanxi provinces on June 28, with people from the two areas driving to Beijing for an opening ceremony on July 1. Participants will then drive to Manzhouli, a city in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region that borders Russia. They will enter Russia on July 5 and attend a launch ceremony in Moscow. After the ceremony, participants will be divided into three groups and take road trips along three different routes: Moscow to Ulyanovsk, a city about 900 kilometers east of the capital; Moscow to Kazan, capital of the Republic of Tatarstan, Russia; and Moscow to St. Petersburg. During their trips, participants will visit a series of red tourism destinations, including the former residence and the tomb of Vladimir Lenin, a Russian communist revolutionary and politician, and a building near suburban Moscow where the sixth National Congress of the Communist Party of China was held in 1928, which is now a museum. Xue Yaping, a senior official with the administration, said the event has been organized to boost exchanges and cooperation between China and Russia on red tourism, while deepening ties between people in the two countries. Tourism authorities and associations in Beijing, Inner Mongolia, Hunan and Shaanxi, as well as travel agencies and car rental companies in Beijing, are supporting the event, Xue said."
0,"At a recent exhibition at the Beijing University of Technology, 21-year-old Polish student Oskar Czajkowsk introduced his graphic design work, the pattern of which, seen from a distance, looks like two interlocking and opposing Cs. The work, on closer inspection, appears less symmetrical as the upper ends of the Cs differ from each other in shape－one looks like the beak of a raptor and the other, the head of a dragon. ""The white-tailed eagle in the Polish emblem is regarded as the symbol of our country. And I learned that the Chinese usually identify themselves as 'the descendants of the dragon',"" says Czajkowsk, who studies at the Poznan University of Technology. ""I portrayed the intertwining eagle and dragon to represent the close relationship between the two countries."" His work was in the running to be chosen as the logo for the Sino-Polish University Consortium Under the Belt and Road Initiative, which was founded in March 2017. It won the second prize in the first art-and-design competition held by the consortium. The exhibition displays some 200 of the winning designs out of the 900 works in the competition. The consortium comprises 15 Chinese universities, including BJUT, Beijing International Studies University, Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture, and Chongqing University, as well as 12 universities from Poland, such as the Opole University of Technology and the Poznan University of Technology.,The consortium aims to facilitate cooperation in higher education between the two countries and create a bond by organizing various activities, such as the exhibition. This time, the competition attracted participants from 31 universities and institutes in China, Poland, Ukraine, South Korea and Estonia with nearly 900 entries covering logo design, crafts, painting, photography, costume design and digital media. Entries were required to show either the history, culture, art or technology of China or of the participants' countries. Chen Lizhong, a postgraduate student from BJUT's school of art and design, prepared for the competition for many months. He was not only a contestant but also among the designers of the brochure, the main illustration and the cloth bags used in the event.,""The national flags of China and Poland feature the color red. So we used red in the main illustration. We wanted all the visual elements of the event to show the characteristics of both countries,"" says the 26-year-old, adding that he had to learn about Polish culture. Chen's schoolmate, 23-year-old Song Peng, was familiar with Polish arts and crafts as her teacher had once suggested that she design tableware based on the culture of the European country. Song then used the stylistic pattern on Polish pottery as the inspiration of her design. She says: ""I tried to distill the cultural messages into a representative image of Polish culture and then made a series of products embodying the core images."" For this competition, she created jewelry based on images related to a poem in the Chinese classic, The Book of Songs, and won a prize. Wu Bin, vice-president of BJUT, says an art and design competition is more inclusive than an academic event, as it allows students from various educational backgrounds to join in and broaden their horizons. Besides, Wu says: ""I hope that through promoting mutual learning and understanding between BJUT and Polish universities, our art-and-design discipline could be further developed and meet international standards. ""Next year, we will take the competition to Poland."" Wojciech Zajaczkowski, the Polish ambassador to China, who attended the opening ceremony of the exhibition, supports the idea. And he hopes that the competition will become a source of inspiration for students from both countries. Speaking about the contestants, Wu Xing, deputy director of BJUT's school of art and design, says most of the contestants were from engineering universities whose strengths are not in art and design, but it was a good chance for them to improve these abilities. ""The contest also helped to inspire the students to develop their artistic skills and promote interdisciplinary studies."",He adds that schools of art and design in engineering universities will only stand out when they find ways to learn from such majors as mechanical engineering and software. Meanwhile, BJUT is running workshops on Chinese painting and calligraphy, traditional tie-dyeing techniques and shadow plays for visiting Polish students after the competition. Polish student Dorota Wozniak says she found similarities between the two cultures. ""We both have exquisite porcelain and traditional paper craftwork,"" she says. ""But there are more cultural similarities for me to discover. A single trip is not enough."""
1,"With their success in popularizing mobile internet applications in China's massive consumer market, local companies are striving to establish a beachhead in the industrial internet, a new front widely recognized as key to integrating the digital and real economies. For example, Haier Group, China's largest home appliance maker has built an industrial internet platform, a network of industrial apps that collect and analyze data from consumers, suppliers and factories boasting machines with internet-connected sensors. The system, COSMOPlat, is designed to allow companies to customize products at speed and scale while boosting productivity and cutting costs. Chen Lucheng, vice-president of Haier, said in addition to making Haier's own factories more flexible, the industrial internet system is empowering companies by bringing them closer to consumers and suppliers The platform involved 320 million users and 3.9 million enterprises last year, covering electronics, textiles, equipment, construction, transportation and chemical engineering. Based on the open platform, Haier has also launched a string of internet-connected smart factories around the country, hoping to boost efficiency. Zhang Ruimin, chairman and CEO of Haier, said the most important characteristic of the internet era is the zero-distance relationship with consumers, highlighting the importance of integrating users and enterprises in the new manufacturing age. Haier's move is part of broader efforts by Chinese companies to drive digital transformation on the nation's sprawling assembly lines. The push is fueled by strong government policy support as well as manufacturers' desire to upgrade their plants. Former Vice-Premier Ma Kai said in a speech earlier this year that the industrial internet has become a new battlefield for global manufacturing and technology companies. The sector remains in its infancy, but it is gaining importance as it provides an opportunity to further enhance China's manufacturing prowess. The State Council unveiled a guideline in November that aims to build three to five industrial internet platforms, which will reach international standards by 2025, and lead the world in key areas by 2035. Specifically, China will build around 10 cross-industry platforms by 2020 to accelerate digital transformation at enterprises. China also aims to encourage over 300,000 industrial enterprises to move their business to cloud platforms and cultivate more than 300,000 industrial apps by the end of 2020. Qianzhan Industry Research Institute forecast that the market size of China's industrial internet sector will reach 10.8 trillion yuan ($1.64 trillion) in 2025, without disclosing the figure for this year. ""Accelerated steps on the industrial internet are of significance to China's advanced manufacturing amid fierce competition from abroad. It will help promote the deeper integration of the nation's real economy with the internet, big data and artificial intelligence,"" said Yang Chunli, a researcher at the China Center for Information Industry Development, a Beijing-based think tank. ""To compete globally in the internet and manufacturing, China must foster national platforms, which will act as the main pillars of future industrial transformation. Key industries such as automobiles, digital, energy and aerospace are some of the potential areas in which to establish such national platforms,"" Yang added. The view was echoed by Qu Xianming, an expert with the National Manufacturing Strategy Advisory Committee. Qu said that as China promotes the in-depth incorporation of technological advances with socio-economic development, innovation will account for an increasingly large part of the real economy. ""Industrial growth will benefit considerably from the strategy, which can drive the long-predicted convergence of the IT and industrial fields in China,"" Qu said. According to the 2017 report of the World Intellectual Property Organization, China is the only middle-income country among the world's top 25 most innovative economies, where it is ranked 22nd. China now has more researchers than the United States, outspends the European Union in research and development, and ""is on track to beat all other nations in its yearly production of scientific papers"", the science magazine Nature reported. But more efforts are required to leverage such technological and innovative prowess to drive the nation's real economy. The industrial internet is an efficient way of injecting such innovation into the manufacturing of consumer electronics, automobiles, clothing and other items, Qu added. According to a recent report from the Alliance of Industrial Internet, China's industrial internet sector is still in its infancy, as a group of Chinese companies, including Sany Heavy Industry Co Ltd, started tapping into the sector several years ago. Last year, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, China's top industry regulator, selected 206 smart manufacturing pilot projects, of which 28 are related to industrial internet innovation. Now, around 50 percent of the world's industrial platforms are provided by US companies and China still faces a gap with developed countries in terms of the function, degree of commercialization and integrity of the overall ecosystem, according to the report. Yang from the China Center for Information Industry Development also noted that a group of companies including China Aerospace Science and Industry Corp, the nation's largest missile maker, and Haier did quite well in industrial internet but some of them focus on certain vertical areas with limited users and resources, which still lag behind world-leading platforms such as General Electric's Predix and Siemens' MindSphere. ""However, most industrial platforms across the world are in the early stage of commercialization and are still exploring the market. In other words, China stands almost at the same starting point as developed countries,"" Yang said. ""Even though some companies have started to map out the industrial internet, they have just launched their products and the service system still needs to be improved,"" she added. In addition to traditional manufacturing companies, telecom carriers are also entering the field. China United Network Communications Group Co, the nation's second-largest mobile carrier by subscribers, established a new unit at Xiongan New Area earlier this year, as part of its broader effort to help build it into a high-tech and smart area. China Unicom Xiongan Industrial Internet Co Ltd, as the new company is called, is designed to co-ordinate innovative business teams and related resources such as cloud computing, big data, internet of things, and the industrial internet for Xiongan New Area. Hao Liqian, chairman of the new company, said China Unicom aims to build globally pioneering network infrastructure and application platforms in Xiongan. Yu Xiaohui, chief engineer at the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, a government think tank affiliated with the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, said a key source of innovation will be smart manufacturing driven by big data. ""Two years ago, big data was chiefly used to help companies do targeted advertising or recommend personalized news in the consumer market,"" Yu says. ""But now the global industry has reached a consensus that big data is the core to powering the new industrial revolution."""
0,"American novelist John Shors, 49, has seven novels under his belt, and all of them are set in Asia. His latest novel   is a love story that takes place on the Great Wall. Unbound is based on an ancient Chinese folk tale about Lady Meng Jiang. Shors fleshed out the original story with fictional side characters and subplots. While the folk tale ends with the tragic deaths of Meng and her husband Fan Xiliang, Shors concluded his version on an upbeat note. Christine Branstad, the wife of the US ambassador to China, Terry Branstad, has read   and recommended it to friends and family, both in China and in the United States. Commenting on the book, she says in an email: ""My husband and I have both read it and loved the beauty of the story and that portion of the history of the Great Wall. It is a true gift to be able to share that story with the world."" Speaking about his work at an event at Beijing's Bookworm store on March 14, Shors said: ""In the West, there are so many novels written, especially within historical fiction, from a sort of European standpoint. And I think there's an amazing part of the world, Asia, that's really underrepresented in Western literature."" The tall, slim and soft-spoken author backpacked across 10 Asian countries when he was 24. And, in 1999, when he was backpacking again in Asia with his wife Allison, Shors discovered the love story behind India's Taj Mahal that inspired his first novel, Beneath a Marble Sky. Since then he has written stories set in Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia and Japan. Shors has always had a keen interest in the ancient Wonders of the World. He has written about the Taj Mahal, Cambodia's Ankgor Wat and now China's Great Wall, by which he has been captivated for almost 10 years. ""I wanted to see the Great Wall, I wanted to walk it, I wanted to understand it, and of course, I wanted to write a book about it,"" says Shors. To create an accurate portrayal of Chinese culture for the book, Shors spent four months researching before putting pen to paper in 2014, including a two-week trip to Beijing in 2013. Then, he walked along the Great Wall for almost a week and felt the texture of the bricks, in an effort to imagine spending time on it from the perspectives of his characters in the book. ""My time on the Great Wall allowed me to see its beauty,"" says Shors. ""This is a graceful, elaborate structure that is far more than a never-ending pile of stacked stones."" Shors admits to his limitations of having to rely on English translations of Chinese historical accounts. ""But I try to get as original source material as possible,"" says Shors.,At home in Boulder, Colorado, Shors kept an English translation of Stories to Enlighten the World, a collection of short stories compiled and edited by Feng Menglong during the Ming Dynasty. During the two-year writing process, he consulted about six experts on Chinese culture and history, including a few from the University of Colorado and one from China. Referring to Shors' efforts to get the details right, Jeremiah Jenne, a Chinese history teacher at IES Abroad in Beijing, says: ""The research John did on material culture is really strong, like some of the descriptions of the clothing, weapons and food."" The book is titled Unbound because its heroine, Meng, has unbound feet and what Shors calls an ""unbound spirit"". Women's empowerment is an important subject in the story. As Shors sees it, Chinese women in the Ming Dynasty pushed boundaries in very subtle ways, for instance, in writing good poetry and getting out of home to travel. So, Shors wanted his heroine Meng to reflect the powerful roles women played in China's history. ""I think there's a concept in the West that historically women in Asia were powerless. I just don't think that's accurate,"" says Shors. ""I wanted to show women as they truly were, perhaps repressed but yet powerful in their own way."" Women of modern China perpetuate Shors' notion. For his side business, Shors organizes annual trips for small groups of readers to the Asian settings of his books. In a 2016 tour to China, five of the six tour guides in Shors' group of 10, were female. ""They were super strong. If I had a problem, I would just say, please fix this problem, and they would fix it,"" says Shors, smacking the back of his hand on his other palm. Meanwhile, Shors is looking for opportunities for Unbound to be published in China. And he doesn't expect there to be more criticism coming from Chinese readers than from other parts of the world. ""I think they'll understand that as an American, I've done my best,"" says Shors. ""The vast majority of the book is historically and culturally accurate."" Speaking about the book, Huang Jiakun, Shors' agent in China, says: ""He has probably set an example for Chinese writers on how to tell China stories."" Huang, who also worked with Shors when the Chinese version of his fourth book The Wishing Trees was published in China in 2011, says she considers Unbound a ""faithful, interesting and innovative approach"" to Chinese traditional folk tales that will appeal to readers beyond China."
1,"As the first China International Import Expo is less than one month away, the host city Shanghai has reached the final stage of its preparations, as products from all over the world have been arriving in the city. Designed to be a world-class event on a par with the most renowned exhibitions in the world, the inaugural import expo combines country exhibitions, enterprise exhibitions and forums to promote free trade and an open global economy. The event, which will be held at the National Exhibition and Convention Center from Nov 5 to 10 in Shanghai, was first announced in 2017 by President Xi Jinping, who called it ""an important policy statement and action demonstrating China's embracing of greater openness"". According to the China International Import Expo Bureau, a total of 2,800 companies from the G20 member states, as well as 50 countries and regions involved in the Belt and Road Initiative, will participate in the expo. Around 160,000 buyers from more than 80,000 domestic and overseas enterprises have also signed up for the event. In addition, 80 countries and three international organizations have confirmed their participation in the event, said the bureau. As the event is drawing near, goods from foreign exhibitors have arrived at local customs. Shanghai has opened green channels for the products, significantly cutting the time needed for them to be unloaded and stored in local warehouses. So far, it is estimated that products from more than 1,500 exhibitors have arrived in the Chinese mainland, while those from another 1,000 have been or are being shipped. Gao Rongkun, director of Shanghai Customs, said that the customs department has drawn on the experiences from the 2008 Beijing Olympics and 2010 Shanghai Expo to design measures for the upcoming event in November, such as offering a one-stop service for exhibit registration, clearance and supervision, and reconciliation. Several other measures were published in June, including the expansion of categories of imported exhibits for agricultural and livestock products, and the simplification of export and disposal procedures for exhibits after the expo. Fang Hui, general manager of the operation department of the National Exhibition and Convention Center, said a temporary customs inspection area will be set up in the northern plaza of the center for late arrivals or highly valuable exhibits that are not suitable for inspection at ports. Chinese companies are eyeing the great potential of boosting imports through the event. ""During the expo, we expect to import at least 1,000 kinds of products and services that have not been sold in the domestic market,"" said Wang Zhe, Party secretary of China's commercial giant Suning Holdings Group. ""In the next three years, we plan to import goods worth 10 billion euros ($11.5 billion)."" Liang Feng, president of the State-owned China National Machine Tool Sales and Technical Service Corporation, said the CIIE will see eight leading companies in the machine tool industry launch a dozen new products in China for the first time. More than 100 new products and technologies are expected to debut at the expo, according to statistics from the organizers. Forty-three African countries have confirmed their participation in the expo. Around 190 enterprises from Africa will promote local products such as Egyptian date palm, Ethiopian coffee, and Amarula from South Africa, according to the organizers. ""The CIIE shows China's changing trade strategy and its resolve to fulfill its responsibility as a major country and achieve mutual benefits and win-win cooperation with all nations,"" said Zhao Beiwen, deputy head of the World Economy Institute of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences. As the host city, Shanghai has been holding rehearsals, improving city infrastructure and training volunteers to meet needs of the upcoming event. A comprehensive rehearsal was held at the expo venue on Oct 4 covering various scenarios. Realizing that the six-day exhibition would be too short a period for exhibitors and buyers from all over the world to learn and take advantage of business opportunities in China, Shanghai's commerce commission has established exhibition and transaction platforms that would be available all year round. These platforms are aimed at providing a channel for foreign products, services and technology to enter the Chinese market. The municipality has also set up a one-stop, year-round platform that will feature import exhibits, including those from the six-day expo."
1,"Artificial intelligence will play an important role in reshaping an array of major industries such as retail, manufacturing and healthcare.  Leading senior executives told the 4th World Internet Conference on Monday that rapid technological changes will transform companies and society.  Robin Li, CEO of Baidu Inc, felt that in comparison with mobile internet technology, which revolutionized consumer services, AI will have a far bigger influence on how companies run their businesses.  ""For instance, Baidu is leveraging AI to help supermarkets better manage their supply of fresh food, by analyzing and predicting which products are most popular,"" said Li, who runs China's largest search engine.  He pointed out that such solutions had effectively reduced food waste and boosted the profit growth at pilot stores.  In other sectors, AI can be used to help coal mining companies reduce accidents by bringing in precautionary measures, while steel mills will be able to automatically check product defects.  Li's comments came as China starts to accelerate artificial intelligence applications in manufacturing, healthcare, automobile, consumer electronics and other key sectors.  In July, the country unveiled a national development plan to build a 1 trillion yuan ($151 billion) AI core industry by 2030. This is supposed to stimulate as much as 10 trillion yuan in related businesses.    Lu Yimin, general manager of China United Network Communications Group Co Ltd, said China Unicom is experimenting with the next-generation mobile communication technology.  The country's second largest telecom carrier by mobile subscribers aims to lay down a sound information infrastructure for the application of AI.  ""Connection is ultimate power for all intelligence,"" Lu said. ""We will start offering pre-commercial 5G service in 2019.""  China Unicom has set up a 10 billion yuan fund to promote the development of the internet of things, or IoT.  In the future, components at assembly lines, as well as electronic home appliances, will be connected to the internet, producing massive amounts of data to fuel the development of artificial intelligence.  ""A key factor of digital economy is integration,"" said Lei Jun, founder and CEO of Chinese smartphone company Xiaomi Corp.  ""Only by integrating AI with various sectors can we give full display of the technological advancements the world has made,"" Lei added.  Last month, Xiaomi had more than 85 million consumer electronic devices on its IoT platform.  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, the largest e-commerce company in China, is also scrambling to apply AI, this time to the care of the elderly.  Chen Lijuan, head of Alibaba AI Lab, announced that the company will bring its voice-assistant smart speaker, Tmall Genie, to selected nursing homes in Beijing by the end of the month.  Senior residents will be able to activate the device through voice commands.  Among a host of applications, it will then be able to turn on, or off, lights, search for weather reports and control other smart-home devices.  ""Such applications can enhance the quality of life for the older generation, and help improve work efficiency of the nursing staff,"" Chen said."
0,"Embroidery is a smart way to let a common outfit tell a story or signal status. In ancient China, royals, especially emperors, used special embroidery to show their status. Thus, taboos developed. For instance, a dragon with five claws was an exclusive pattern only for the emperor. If anyone dare use such embroidery on his or her clothes, it would result in that person's death. Different animals were embroidered on the robes to mark two main groups of officers: civil and military. Animals on the former's vestments were often birds, while the latter had beasts.,The requirement of the royals let Beijing embroidery blossom in the Ming and Qing dynasties (1368-1911) since it was born in the Tang Dynasty (618-907). And it got another name, royal embroidery, in ancient China's last dynasty. At the time, Beijing embroidery was followed by many common workshops, becoming one of the ""Eight Wonders of Yanjing"", along with other seven first-rate craftsmanship in Beijing.,Compared to other traditional embroideries, such as the works from Suzhou and Hunan, Beijing embroidery is known for its rich hued colors, descent patterns and luxury decorations. Not only gold and silver yarn, but genuine jewelry was widely used in the latter group. In 2014, the crafts were listed as a national intangible cultural heritage, and carried forward both inheritors and modern designers. One is D.Rita, a brand specialized in making couture designs with Chinese embroideries.,The founder, Yu Dan, brought her works, a series of fine clothes dazzling with Beijing embroidery to a show at the Prince Kung's Mansion on June 8. The models, from toddlers to young women to aged couples, wore clothes that combined modern designs and Beijing embroidery. Yu wants the traditional crafts to return to people's daily life in forms of modern design, rather than just being a silent heritage living in records.,The designer added light hues in the series, including pale blue and light pink, to make the clothes more suitable for daily wear. ""Based on the traditional crafts, we also create some new patterns, such as flowers. In the past, lily flower was not included, but now we use it on many of our clothes,"" Yu told China Daily Website at the show. Considering old-fashioned taboos, Yu said her brand had clothes with patterns that were only for emperors. Yet some of her clients declined such designs.,""These clients don't think they have enough confidence to wear such clothes with powerful animal pattern,"" Yu said. Out of the love for traditional Chinese culture, Yu established the brand in 2013 and opened her first store in Beijing one year later."

Five winning enterprises were selected from 12 entrants at the capital’s National Convention Center. Their employees will now receive intense training with peers from other cities — Kunming, Chengdu, Xi’an, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Yan’an and Shenzhen — and Silicon Valley in the US before a final later this year. The winner will receive funding from a seed-money foundation and other financial support, according to a news release from the university. Beihang University has been named by the central government as a model in terms of sci-tech innovation and helping staff members and students start businesses. In the past four years, the university has offered support to 75 high-tech companies founded by Beihang students, the news release added."
1,"Two fast trains decorated with a China International Import Expo (CIIE) theme went into service on the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway on Wednesday morning, reports thepaper.cn. An introduction to the expo is displayed throughout the carriages. The train information system and Wi-Fi service portal are also being used to share some of the highlights of the upcoming expo. And passengers can access news and information about the expo from its official WeChat account by scanning a QR code prominently displayed throughout the trains. The China International Expo Bureau, along with China Railway Shanghai Group, designed the two CIIE-themed trains with the goal of raising public awareness about the event, which is the country's first import expo. The first themed train departed from Shanghai Hongqiao Railway Station on Wednesday morning, the other departed from Beijing South Railway Station in the afternoon. The two trains will run on the Beijing-Shanghai line until the end of the event, which will run from November 5 to 10 in Shanghai."
1,"Aboard the train designated C2022, attendant supervisor Xu Ying walks down the aisles checking luggage safety and sanitary conditions. The high-speed train, running at more than 300 kilometers per hour, takes 35 minutes from Tianjin to Beijing. Passengers read magazines, bury themselves in their phones or simply doze off. ""Now people are used to high-speed trains, but the situation was different 10 years ago,"" Xu said. ""Many left their seats to look here and there. Even the bathrooms became resorts."" On Aug 1, 2008, China's first high-speed railway line-from Beijing to Tianjin-began operations. Many passengers, including foreigners who came to watch the Beijing Olympics that year, simply wanted to experience travel by high-speed train. ""They kept staring at the display showing the train's speed and watching outside to feel it,"" Xu said. Some passengers would ask Xu to pose for photos with them. David Feng of Switzerland, who teaches at a Beijing university, wrote about his feelings aboard the fast train that day. ""Speeds maxed out at 348 km/h near the northern suburbs of Tianjin. It took me around just 30 minutes to change cities-something basically impossible to believe until that day."" The daily frequency of Beijing-Tianjin one-way intercity trains has increased from 94 to 217, with 250 million passengers transported in the past decade, according to the Beijing Railway Bureau. Njeri Kamau of Kenya teaches English at a kindergarten in Tianjin. She takes the high-speed train every Friday afternoon to meet her husband, who works in Beijing. The high-speed train has made it so much easier to maintain the long distance relationship, she said. The first high-speed railway in North China's Inner Mongolia autonomous region was completed on Tuesday. The 287-km line passes Hohhot and Ulanqab, and then goes to Zhangjiakou in neighboring Hebei province. It is expected to start operations at the end of 2019 along with the Beijing-Zhangjiakou high-speed railway. The two lines will reduce travel time between Beijing and Hohhot from nine hours to three. By then, all provincial-level regions on the Chinese mainland will have high-speed trains, except the Tibet autonomous region. The length of high-speed railway lines in China hit 25,000 km as of the end of last year, accounting for two-thirds of the world's total. More than 4,000 bullet trains run in China, carrying 4 million passengers every day, according to the China Railway Corp. When Han Yonghui first left his home in Xiangfen, Shanxi province, to open a small restaurant in 1997, he had to walk for an hour to the nearest train station and wait in line overnight to buy a ticket before boarding a packed slow train that took him to Tianjin in 18 sweltering hours. All that changed when high-speed trains reached Han's hometown in 2014, cutting his travel time to Beijing, where he runs a restaurant, to six hours. ""My high-school children are able to come to visit every summer vacation,"" Han said. A high-speed railway connecting Beijing and Guangzhou has shortened the travel time across the 2,300-km distance to eight hours. The new Fuxing bullet trains travel at 350 km/h, going from Beijing to Shanghai in four hours and 18 minutes. By 2020, the length of China's high-speed rail lines is expected to reach 30,000 km, covering 80 percent of major cities. A network of eight east-west high-speed rail lines and eight north-south lines will be built, according to a railway development plan. High-speed rail has helped with the integrated regional development of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei province, a national strategy initiated in 2014. Wang Ye from Beijing takes the C2205 to work every morning. In 24 minutes, the train takes her to Tianjin's Wuqing district, where Wang works at a factory that manufactures train parts, Tieke Zongheng. Of the 150-plus employees in the factory, more than 20 commute from Beijing every day. ""High-speed trains have made the intercity commute possible,"" Wang said. Wuqing has attracted more than 8,200 projects from Beijing over the past five years, including Tieke Zongheng. Investment in these projects has totaled 51.6 billion yuan ($7.6 billion), according to the district government. The Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei region has showcased the high-speed railway economy. High-speed rail symbolizes the new structure of the Chinese economy, influencing all aspects of society. By the end of 2017, China's high-speed trains had carried more than 7 billion passengers. Cargo delivery via high-speed trains started in 2016, with more than 500 cities used as pilot areas for express services. China's high-speed rail has also gone global. In 2014, China completed the construction of its first overseas high-speed rail in Turkey. In June 2015, China and Russia inked deals for 770 km of track connecting Moscow and Kazan. In October 2015, China and Indonesia signed a joint-venture on the construction of a high-speed rail between Jakarta and Bandung. Huang Yanghua, an associate researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, believes high-speed rail had saved time, helped integrate the regional economy, boosted the flow of talent and information, and reshaped China's economic map.

0,"Enterprises in China did not perform well in environmental information disclosure in 2017, but they made ""a little"" progress compared with the previous year, said an evaluation report released by Beijing University of Chemical Technology on Sunday. Invited by the China Forum of Environmental Journalists, the university surveyed listed companies in stock markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen to evaluate their work in reporting environmental issues in 2017 and received responses from 857 companies. The report said that 85 percent of the companies evaluated got scores of less than 50. A full score is 100. In terms of the disclosure level of different industries, mining, hotels, catering, and transportation ranked at the top in order, while information, public health, scientific research and media were at the bottom. Liu Qingsong, deputy secretary-general of the China Forum of Environmental Journalists, said that the report aimed to improve enterprises' awareness of protecting the environment and encouraging them to publicize their environmental information. ""Listed companies should firmly implement this disclosure system and accept supervision from the public. The system also can help them to improve the quality of the business,"" he said. Liu Xuezhi, a professor of low carbon economy at Beijing University of Chemical Technology who conducted the survey, suggested that to boost the transparency of environmental information, laws and guidelines should be carried out by the government to offer enterprises standards when disclosing its information. ""Enterprises in China should learn from their counterparts abroad, that is besides annual environmental report, to make use of more media channels, such as Weibo, to interact with the public. Also, investors should take the ability of environmental information disclosure into consideration before making the decision,"" she added."
0,"BEIJING -- A new novel, depicting the battle against poverty in China's Tibetan areas, has recently been published in Beijing after the writer devoted 15 years to poverty alleviation on the plateau. Titled ""Snow Lotus,"" which is a rare herb grown at a high altitude and highly prized for its use in medicine, the novel tells the story of the protagonist taking part in poverty relief by running schools in Tibet. The novel was inspired by the real-life experience of the writer Jiang Juechi, who has supported education by building schools and providing basic care and classes to orphans, dropouts and impoverished children on the plateau. Experts said the novel not only offers a panorama of the country's poverty alleviation on the plateau but also details the improved living standards of people in Tibet, as well as the local customs and practices. The book is published by the People's Literature Publishing House."
1,"Premier Li Keqiang reiterated on Monday China's commitment to treat domestic and foreign companies as equals and better protect the rights of foreign businesses. His remarks were made to about 100 overseas representatives of Fortune 500 companies, leading research institutions and international organizations who were in Beijing to attend the China Development Forum 2019. Li reaffirmed that China will only become more open to the world and will continue to adopt concrete measures to protect the rights of foreign investors, based on the requirements of further opening-up and reactions from foreign businesses. China remains the world's largest developing country, and it owes its tremendous achievements over the past 40 years to reform and opening-up, he said. The country will step up the protection of intellectual property rights across the board and refine its punitive compensation mechanism for infringements, he said. He added that China will never allow the forced transfer of technology and that it will resolutely punish different types of IPR violations to create a business environment based on the rule of law that is internationalized and enabling. He noted that the adoption of the Foreign Investment Law by the National People's Congress earlier this month was part of the country's effort to protect foreign investment through legal measures. The world is facing a new industrial and technological revolution, and the only viable choice is to embrace it, not reject it, he said. The Chinese government has always adopted regulations that are accommodating and prudent toward innovation, rather than curbing them, and it encourages the development of new technologies and new business types and will create an enabling environment for innovation, he said. Li also noted that the Chinese economy has achieved generally stable growth while making progress over the past year. Faced with new downward pressure, the country will continue to focus its efforts on the reduction of taxes and fees, while fostering new growth engines, he said. Rather than relying on raising deficits or easing monetary policy, the Chinese government will seek to further stimulate the vitality of the market and to power growth through more reform and opening-up, he said. Dieter Zetsche, chairman of the board of management of Daimler AG and head of Mercedes-Benz Cars, said the foreign delegates to the forum have gained many new exciting insights, ranging from the planned measures, structural reform and fiscal reform to reforms in the manufacturing policy and financial sector through the China Development Forum. ""All of this further strengthened our confidence in this great market,"" said Zetsche, who is also co-chair of the forum."

Now, before making the trip to Scotland in person, Chinese audiences have the chance to experience the event at the cinema. In cooperation with ATW Beijing and CinemaLive, the Tattoo hit the Chinese big screen for the first time on Jan 25 in Beijing, the birthday of Scottish poet Robert Burns. Other screenings opened in Shanghai, Chengdu, Guangzhou and Wuhan on the same day, offering audiences a true taste of Scottish pride and a celebration of world cultures. The event being screened is the 2018 Tattoo which was based around the theme of ""The Sky's the Limit"", commemorating the centenary of Britain's Royal Air Force and echoing Scotland's ""Year of Young People"" in 2018.,Lynsey Fusco, director of marketing and communications at the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo, says they chose the aerial theme not simply to pay homage to the Royal Air Force for protecting the skies, but also to encourage young people to avoid placing limits on themselves and reach their true potential. Featuring performers dressed in national costume-the glengarry, waistcoat and kilt-the event showcases authentic Scottish dancing and music characterized by the bagpipes and drums. Apart from the recurring performance of the massed pipes and drums, the event also celebrates international cultures by inviting different military bands and performance troupes from around the world to take part, including Malawi, Oman, Switzerland, the Czech Republic and the United States.,The spectacle is enhanced by visual touches such as projections onto the walls of Edinburgh Castle, spectacular fireworks and laser shows. The Royal Air Force Aerobatic Team, the Red Arrows, also paint the sky with the iconic British national colors of red, white and blue by releasing smoke trails. ""Rather than simply being a series of military musical performances, the Tattoo is a comprehensive display by each country, one after another. During the 90-minute show, you will be able to experience the art and culture of each country, which is highly satisfying visually, aurally and emotionally,"" theater practitioner Cui Hao says. Since its debut in 1950, the Tattoo has been held every year throughout August on the esplanade of Edinburgh Castle, a famous Scottish landmark and historical site. According to the Tattoo's official statistics, the event has been sold out for the past 20 consecutive years, with each year attracting around 220,000 onsite spectators and a TV audience of over 100 million.,""Cinema is a fantastic way to see the show, since its impeccable sound quality and visuals offer a real flavor of Edinburgh in August,"" Fusco says. Throughout the festival's history, troupes from more than 50 countries have participated in the event, including China. And as far back as 2004, the military band of the Chinese People's Liberation Army was invited to perform at the festival. Most recently, in 2015, a troupe of 80 performers from the PLA band presented a show lasting over 8 minutes which combined army tunes with Chinese folk music. Meanwhile, Fusco is keen to address the increasing demand for the Tattoo overseas. In 2016, the Tattoo staged live performances in Australia and New Zealand, attracting audiences of more than 240,000. As ties between China and the United Kingdom continue to grow, the Tattoo is becoming increasingly well-known in China. The number of Chinese people attending the event in Edinburgh soared in 2016 and the Tattoo is planning to stage performances in China from 2020, Fusco says."

1,"The Beijing International Fair for Trade in Service will kick off in 50 days. Running from May 28 to June 1 at the Beijing National Conference Center, the fair is about to bring a grand festival for the service industry.  The event committee has released detailed plans for the fair including the exhibition, the venue map, and more than 80 scheduled conferences.  In recent years, China has been underpinning the importance of the third industry and put considerable efforts into pushing the internalization of this industry to a higher level. A series of free trade zones (FTZs) and trade in service pilot zones have been deployed in different cities, which have been successful. After setting up the Shanghai FTZ in 2013, seven more cities followed in 2016 to accelerate this opening-up policy.  Meanwhile, to further accelerate the development of trade in services and encourage innovation, 15 pilot zones were set up including Tianjin and Shanghai.  This year the State Council announced an expansion of the use of foreign investment, which has shown the nation’s determination in implementing the opening-up strategy. Beijing, a pioneering city for the opening-up of the service industry, has already made progress and has helped 10 new industries to emerge, including finance, tourism, culture, healthcare, internet and information services. And this year the capital will keep pushing forward progress to deepen the opening-up trend.  With this as the backdrop, this year’s fair is expected to welcome domestic and international investors with confidence, shared experiences, industry insight exchanges, and opportunities for collaboration.  Highlighting the notion of “opening-up, innovation, and integration”, the fair will give the first priority to providing better service for potential business partners and encouraging negotiation towards collaboration.  Six areas will be put under the spotlight: scientific technology service, internet and information service, culture and education, financial services, business tourism, and healthcare.  Deeply aware of the importance of international and domestic industrial organization and agency in international trade, the fair has also invited a number of international organizations, delegates from various countries and regions, and both domestic and foreign government representatives.  More than thirty Chinese organizations in the third industry will also attend the grand event to host exhibitions and dialogues that showcase the latest products and modes, as well as accelerate integration and collaboration between different lines of work. The underlined areas include technology trade, e-commerce, culture, sports financial services, and Chinese medicine.  The conferences to be held this year will concentrate on what is trending, spanning from e-commerce, intellectual property, the mode of the sharing economy, and crossover collaboration.  It will also focus on the investment potential from abroad with a series of events and dialogues addressing the challenges and opportunities.  Up until now the preparation is under smooth progress and the grand event is expected to commence in 50 days."
0,"The Buddhist Association of China called for stronger Buddhist ethics and resistance to the commercialization of Buddhism, at the conclusion of its council meeting in Beijing on Wednesday. ""Religious ethics have been, and still are, the fundamental issue of Buddhism,"" a release from the conference said. It called on Buddhist communities to correct the weakening of belief, slack discipline, arrogance and chasing fame and luxury. The conference accepted the resignation of Master Xuecheng as president of the Buddhist Association of China and appointed Master Yanjue, currently vice-president of the association, to temporarily take charge. Master Xuecheng, who is abbot of Longquan Temple in Beijing, is under investigation by the State Administration for Religious Affairs after being accused in a 95-page report late last month of various violations, including sexual harassment of nuns and financial irregularities. He has denied the allegations and posted a statement on his Sina Weibo account saying they stemmed from ""fabricated material"" and ""distorted facts"". The conference also concluded that it was necessary to integrate the traditional monastery system and the management methods of modern social organizations, and to conduct financial and construction activities legally. Buddhist communities have been told to resist the commercialization of the religion, which has disrupted Buddhist activities, damaged its image and undermined the social atmosphere, the association found. Buddhist communities nationwide should understand the dangers of commercialization, it found, and should resist the illegal construction of large-scale open-air Buddhist statues. They should also avoid private investment to contract and operate temples, and not raise money in the name of Buddhism. They should safeguard the rights of Buddhism under the law and promote its healthy development, it said. wangkeju@chinadaily.com.cn"

The area has been preparing for this expansion since its establishment was announced in April, with President Xi Jinping pledging to make people's interests among the top priorities when pushing for the area's development.  Xi visited Anxin county in Xiongan on Feb 23 for an inspection tour before the announcement.  ""The area must let local residents benefit from the development of Xiongan and they should have an actual feeling of satisfaction,"" Xi said on the visit. The new area spans the counties of Xiongxian, Rongcheng and Anxin, which have about 1.2 million residents.  ""We have maintained the people-centered development path because we are building the new area for the benefit of people, otherwise its development would have no significance,"" said Liu Baoling, executive deputy director of the administrative committee of Xiongan New Area.  Liu said he spent the past few months figuring out how to bring genuine happiness to the people. The work paid off.  Residents have become more supportive and active, after their initial surprise and concerns about their future.  China announced on April 1 the decision to set up the Xiongan New Area to advance the coordinated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region.  The move is a ""major historic and strategic choice made by the Communist Party of China Central Committee with comrade Xi Jinping as the core"", said a circular issued by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council.  If all goes according to plan, the area will become an innovative hub and home for Beijing's ""non-capital"" functions.  Locals are now looking forward to the new area.  ""I know it's a good thing for us, but at first I was really worried about how farmers like me, who don't have much knowledge and skills, can make a living in such a high-end environment,"" said Zhang Baozeng, 60, a farmer from Zhongliu village in Anxin county.  Residents are attending training projects, provided by the government for free, to gain skills.  The government brought in training agencies in June to prepare residents for a diverse range of fields, from lawyers to tea-makers, Liu said. So far, more than 3,000 residents have been trained and about 10,000 will be trained by year's end.  The area, about 100 kilometers southwest of Beijing, eventually will cover 2,000 square kilometers and house 2 million to 2.5 million people.  ""I accompanied President Xi during his visit to the new area. I could feel he cared most about people's living,"" said Liu.  Seven months after Xi's visit, there is no big change yet to the area's appearance, but it has undergone tremendous change in the population's state of mind."

According to Beijing News on Tuesday, supermarkets in Nanjing, Jiangsu province, and Beijing were found to be selling fakes. Supermarket chains Carrefour in Beijing and Greenland Direct Global Goods and Hualian Supermarket in Nanjing were named. Beijing's market regulation bureau, which is responsible for food and drug oversight, has received complaints and launched an investigation.

0,"Hollywood star Liam Neeson's popularity isn't falling with age. It is the opposite. After the English-language French action thriller   became a sleeper hit in 2008, he saw his fame grow at the age of 56. The movie, starring him as a former CIA operative who seeks to rescue his kidnapped daughter, reshaped his career, bringing Neeson a dozen similar roles in films such as   and  . During a recent visit to Beijing to promote  which will be released in Chinese mainland theaters on Friday, Neeson said it was China that changed his professional life. Neeson, now 65, went to the annual Shanghai International Film Festival in 2006 to support his late wife Natasha Richardson's film The White Countess, which is an epic romance set in 1930s Shanghai. The 135-minute feature also starring Neeson's friend, British actor Ralph Fiennes, is a coproduction of China and the United Kingdom, and was selected as the festival's opening film. Richardson passed away after suffering serious injuries in a ski accident in 2009. ""I had read the script of   before (touring Shanghai). The story is very cool. My agent found that Luc Besson was there. I think, 'Great! I would get the chance to ask him: Can you think of me to be a part of this movie?'"" he recalls, with a smile.,As a prestigious French filmmaker, Besson is known for his independent works as well as internationally popular hits such as the Transporter series and Lucy. That year in Shanghai, he presided over the jury of the festival's Golden Goblet Award. Neeson recommended himself, saying he had been part of action-packed movies such as Excalibur (1981) and Kingdom of Heaven (2005), in both of which he fought with swords. Taken, which cost around $25 million to make, earned more than $145 million worldwide, generating two sequels and lifting Neeson to the ranks of the highest-paid stars in Hollywood. ""If I hadn't been for Shanghai, I might not have got the film,"" says the star while holding a green mug. Returning to China's big screen, Neeson will again step into a familiar zone to play an unlikely hero to face off with the villains. In  which also casts Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson and Jonathan Banks, an insurance salesman, played by Neeson, suffers a midlife financial crisis after getting fired. When he, the protagonist, who is also a former policeman, rides a train, during a daily commute that he has taken over the past 10 years, a mysterious woman offers him a $100,000 job to find a passenger, which traps him in an extremely dangerous situation. ""My character is an average guy who gets himself into a situation that the audience would identify with,"" says Neeson, adding that the story is complex. ""He is certainly not a superhero. He has been sacked in his job. No money is coming. He has got mortgages and his son is going to college, which will cost a lot."" The movie also marks Neeson's fourth collaboration with Spanish director Jaume Collet-Serra, who worked with Neeson in the feature films   (2011),   (2014) and   (2015).,Speaking about his longtime friendship with Collet-Serra, Neeson says: ""We are like dancing partners. Each time, the chemistry gets stronger. He makes my job easier."" But to most fans who are familiar with Neeson, he has the talent to skillfully interpret diverse roles. He actually shot to fame through Steven Spielberg's Oscar-winning film,   (1993), and gained more stardom from the historical biopic,   (1996). Neeson has also starred in Hollywood blockbusters like Star Wars: Episode I－  (1999) and   (2005). The star, who will turn 66 years old in June, says, ""To be honest, I'm not a huge fan of all these superhero movies. I admire the expertise."" But for art-house films, the real problem is to get the money to make them, he adds. Neeson says he is a supporter of film festivals. He says they demonstrate the diversity of cinematic art and attract audiences to theaters. When his assistant reminds him to leave at the end of the interview, he still lingers and asks about the opening dates of the two forthcoming international festivals in Beijing and Shanghai.

Born in Qingdao, in the eastern province of Shandong, the 34-year-old book editor moved to Beijing in 2007 after graduating from college.  First, he rented an apartment near his workplace in Shijingshan district on the West Fifth Ring Road. It was a good time; he dated his girlfriend - now his wife - and was free from care and responsibilities.  When the couple married three years ago, they moved into an apartment owned by Luo's father-in-law in Changping, 56 kilometers from his workplace.  ""I felt like I didn't see the sun for three years,"" he said. ""I left home at about 6 a.m. to get to work before 9 am.""  His journey consisted of a 30-minute, 14-km drive to the nearest subway station, followed by 90 minutes on the subway to Shijingshan. The culmination was a 30-minute walk to his office.  ""If I got lucky, the journey took two and a half hours. When the traffic was bad, though, the trip took three hours. I finished work at 5 pm, which meant I didn't get home until 8 pm,"" he said.  ""I was so eager to change the situation. Six hours there and back was killing me. I had no time for myself. Apart from eating and sleeping, I hardly did anything at home.""  Even though he was unhappy, Luo was eager to stay in the capital.  ""Beijing has attractions my hometown can't provide. Maybe life would be easier if I returned to my hometown. It would be more convenient, but I would lose more than I would gain compared with life here,"" he said.  He sold an apartment he owned in Qingdao and used the money as a down payment for a 50-square-meter apartment in Mentougou.  Even though he still lives far from the city center, his new home is 18 km from his work, saving him time and effort  ""I feel great after the move,"" he said. ""Now, I have more time for my wife and young child."""
0,"More than 450 journalists from BRI countries and regions tour city, learn about history, business-boosting efforts The second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, taking place from Thursday to Saturday, is giving Beijing the chance to show off its longtime efforts in preserving cultural heritage, developing the creative industry and promoting cultural exports. More than 450 journalists from the countries and regions involved the Belt and Road Initiative, including nearly 400 from abroad, were invited by the Press Center of the forum and the Beijing Information Office to join in a three-day city tour that started on Tuesday. According to local officials, foreign journalists learned more about the ancient capital's history, traditional Chinese culture and the creative industry's efforts to combine a modern lifestyle with Oriental elements on a visit to the Museum of Confucius Temple and Guozijian, or the Imperial College, as well as the 77 Creative Park on the first day of the tour. ""This is my first trip to Beijing,"" said Alex from Chile. ""Beijing's Confucius Temple and the Imperial College are what I most look forward to visiting."" ""My house in Santiago is close to a Confucius Institute and many of my friends are learning Chinese so I've become very interested in traditional Chinese culture."" The Confucius Temple and the Imperial College, showcasing Chinese people's respect and thirst for knowledge, served as a bridge between ancient China and the outside world. Many journalists were amazed to learn that since the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), the Imperial College had been recruiting students from other countries including Japan, Vietnam, Thailand and Russia.,The Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) government even set up a special school to teach students from Russia. The media delegation also watched Dacheng Etiquette. The ritual performance is the same as the ancient one, thanks to Beijing's sustained campaign for culture preservation and innovation. When the ritual was over, they said that they appreciated the profound culture and Confucian thoughts. Last year, the city government issued a framework plan for the protection and utilization of old factories to expand space for cultural development and the local creative industry. Located inside the compound of the Imperial College, 77 Creative Park is an exemplary case of the drive. The creative park, which used to be the Beijing Printing Factory, the structure of which still remains, has attracted many startup businesses engaged in the creative industry. In the yard of 77 Creative Park, many esteemed artists and craftsmen from Beijing now demonstrate their skills in paper-cutting, lacquerware carving, seal cutting and monkey toy making to the visitors. Some of the audience said they admired Beijing's efforts in not only protecting handicraft techniques but also bringing them closer to people's lives.,On the final day of the city tour, journalists visited the Beijing Tianzhu Free Trade Zone and two major areas in it - the National Base for International Cultural Trade (Beijing) and the Cross-border E-commerce Direct Mail Station of Beijing Capital International Airport. The Beijing Tianzhu Free Trade Zone is the city's only special customs supervision zone and China's first airport comprehensive bonded zone connecting with Beijing Capital International Airport, which provides quick and direct access to imports and exports. The free trade zone provides duty-free foreign goods, tax refunds and tax exemptions for companies. For example, it is implementing the value-added tax ""exemption, offset and refund"" policy for aero engine maintenance. The policy can avoid double tax payments worth about 3.1 million yuan ($461,370) for maintenance of an engine and reduce about 200,000 yuan in logistics cost and around 15 days in logistics time, local officials said. The National Base for International Cultural Trade (Beijing) was created to advance the Belt and Road Initiative and Beijing's goal to become a national cultural center, they said. ""It is providing services in such areas as exhibition and experience, communication and promotion, transaction settlement, startup incubation and cultivation, financing and investment, and warehousing and logistics,"" they noted. There are three marketing centers in operation and more than 20 companies settled at a cross-border e-commerce industrial park within the FTZ. Several commodity halls for Germany, Australia, Argentina, the United States and other countries also can be seen in the FTZ. By building such cultural exchange platforms, Beijing can play an important role in promoting China's cultural product and service exports and fostering cultural businesses and professionals, local officials said."

0,"Former vice-premier Qian Qichen, who was China's foreign minister for a decade, died on Tuesday night in Beijing, according to a statement from the central authority released on Wednesday. He was 90. Qian was born in 1928 in Tianjin. In 1942, he joined the Communist Party of China as a middle school student in Shanghai. After studying in the former Soviet Union, he began his diplomatic career by working in the Chinese embassy in Moscow in 1955. Qian later served as ambassador to Guinea and director-general of the foreign ministry's Information Department. He had a close relationship with the press. Early in his career, Qian worked at Shanghai's Ta Kung Pao, which is said to be the oldest Chinese language newspaper still in operation in China. While serving as head of the Information Department, he proposed establishing a spokesman system and even acted as de facto first spokesman of the ministry. Qian was vice-foreign minister from 1982 to 1988 and minister from 1988 to 1998. He was vice-premier of the State Council from 1993 and retired in 2003. Shi Yinhong, director of the Center of US Studies at Renmin University of China in Beijing, said Qian ""made great contributions to China's relations with the US, Russia and neighboring countries"". ""He was a very experienced diplomat. With a calm character, he was good at handling crises and was trusted by generations of Chinese leaders."" Qian was the first Chinese foreign minister to attend an ASEAN event, the 1991 ASEAN Foreign Ministers Meeting in Malaysia. It was the first time China formally recognized ASEAN as an institution and laid the groundwork for future ASEAN-China cooperation. Ruan Zongze, executive vice-president of the China Institute of International Studies, said Qian managed to improve China's relations with Western countries in the 1990s. ""He was also the first Chinese diplomat to publish a book－Ten Episodes in China's Diplomacy－to reveal stories behind the scenes in his own perspective,"" Ruan said. In 1996, Qian was appointed director of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region."
1,"BEIJING - The ongoing trade frictions with the United States will have limited negative influence on the Chinese macro economy, experts said. ""China's economy is running stable and maintains good momentum for growth. The trend is expected to continue for the long term. The Chinese market has great leeway, strong growth impetus and resilience,"" said Wang Changlin, vice-president of the Academy of Macroeconomic Research of the National Development and Reform Commission. The trade friction with the United States will exert some influence on the Chinese economy, but will be limited in general, according to Wang. The United States on April 3 announced tariffs on a proposed list of Chinese goods worth $50 billion. The list was authorized by the US Trade Representative's office, which in August 2017 initiated an unfounded investigation under the Section 301 of the US Trade Act of 1974 to probe China's intellectual property and technology transfer practices. According to an initial estimate, declines of exports up to $50 billion would drag China's GDP growth rate down by less than 0.1 percentage point, Wang said. China is still fully capable of achieving its annual growth target of around 6.5 percent this year and maintaining the surveyed urban unemployment rate within 5.5 percent while creating more than 11 million new urban jobs. ""The industries targeted by the proposed US tariff increases are not labor intensive, which means that export declines in these sectors will not cause large-scale layoffs,"" said Wang. New overseas markets will be developed, as will the potential of the domestic market, further diminishing the negative influence of tariff increases, he said. Wang also believes China's plan to impose additional tariffs on US goods, including soybeans and pork, will have a minor influence on inflation. China imported 32.85 million metric tons of soybeans from the United States, accounting for more than one-third of China's total soybean imports. Tariff increases will make US soybeans uncompetitive, causing them to be replaced by products from Brazil and Argentina, according to Chen Yang, a researcher with the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences. If there is a price hike of 25 percent on soybeans, the consumer price index (CPI) will be raised by about 0.25 percentage point. The CPI control target of around 3 percent this year will still be reached, analysts said. For the United States, however, it will be hard to find an alternative buyer like China for its soybeans. Also, the burden of the proposed US tariff increases on Chinese products will be shouldered by the whole industrial chain, putting pressure on exporters, raw material providers and retailers, as well as US buyers, rather than by Chinese enterprises only, according to Wang. China's financial market will also remain stable, given that the country's economic growth is stable, business efficiency is improving and consumer prices are running in a low range, according to Wang. He suggested China continue to take good care of its own affairs and avoid being misled by others. China will not surrender to external pressure, Vice-Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao reiterated earlier this month. ""Looking at it another way, external pressure is the driving force for innovation and development,"" Zhu said. China's trade surplus with the United States grew 13 percent year-on-year to 1.87 trillion yuan last year, data showed. The trade imbalance between the two countries is structural, with China exporting more commodities to the United States while importing more services, according to Minister of Commerce Zhong Shan. China has repeatedly voiced its commitment to further opening up and support for economic globalization to facilitate both domestic and global development."

Last year, 646,000 passengers traveled back and forth between Beijing and Tianjin at least twice a month. The pass is expected to benefit more than 200,000 people.  The pass will save passengers the trouble of buying tickets, and the discount is expected to attract more people to commute between the two cities, Sun Wenkui, vice-mayor of Tianjin, said on Saturday.  Currently, 184 trains arrive and depart from both Beijing and Tianjin every day, carrying more than 80,000 passengers.  Calling the launch of the pass a move to promote the integration of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei, Sun said the Tianjin government will ""make a greater step forward"" to promote the integration of the three areas' transportation systems through further cooperation with China Railway Corp, the national network operator.  There are two kinds of train passes: a gold one for first-class seats and a silver one for second-class seats. A first class seat for a single journey between Beijing and Tianjin costs 65.5 yuan ($10), while the price for second class is 54.5 yuan.  Passengers can get a 5 percent discount if they pay for 20 single journeys up front. The discount will increase to 15 percent for gold pass holders who pay for 90 journeys and for silver pass holders who pay for 100 journeys, the Tianjin government said.  Pass holders will use their cards at a special ticket machine where they can choose a train and print a ticket with a seat assignment.  ""We are trying to keep the Beijing-Tianjin intercity line in the lead,"" said Huang Xin, deputy director of CRC's transport bureau. ""The train pass is an innovation, and we are looking forward to seeing future promotions on other railways.""  Passengers have been expecting the discount passes since the Tianjin government announced in February that they would be issued, said Zou Yirong, from the marketing department of Tianjin Research Institute for Advanced Equipment, affiliated with Tsinghua University in Beijing.  ""The train pass was the talk of the office back then,"" she said, adding that about 40 researchers at her institute are regular commuters between the two cities - and they would save time and money with the passes.  Xiang Nan, chairman of a Tianjin-based investment company that has offices in Beijing and Tianjin, said: ""We are definitely going to make a group purchase for me and five other colleagues who need to take the train every day.""  ""I used to spend 2,600 yuan on the train every month. Now 400 yuan of that can be saved. That is good news for me,"" said a man who only disclosed his name only as Duan. The man paid for 100 single journeys with second-class seats on Monday as he often has to travel between Beijing and Tianjin for work."

0,"Of all the works of William Shakespeare that have graced the theaters in China, Hamlet is arguably the most famous among Chinese audiences. It has also been adapted many times in the country. The latest version of the play to tread the boards of the National Center for the Performing Arts in Beijing, entitled The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, directed by Li Liuyi, will make its debut on Nov 28 and will run through Dec 5. Veteran Chinese actors Hu Jun, Pu Cunxi and Lu Fang will play the leading roles, along with a group of younger actors, including Miao Chi, Li Shilong and Jing Xi, most of whom work with the established Beijing People's Art Theatre. Before The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, Li Liuyi directed the Chinese version of Shakespeare's King Lear last year in another collaboration with the NCPA. The NCPA has been working with the Royal Shakespeare Company, a theater organization based in the Bard's hometown of Stratford-upon-Avon, on the Shakespeare Folio Project, which aims to make the playwright's work more accessible to Chinese speakers. During the development of Chinese versions of Shakespeare's plays, the Royal Shakespeare Company invites companies of actors, directors and playwrights from China and the United Kingdom to work together on translating Shakespeare's texts. So far, the NCPA has brought out five of Shakespeare's plays under the auspices of the project. The translation of the Chinese script of the play, The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, was finished in London last year and Li Liuyi and the leading cast members were involved in the adaptation process ""When we started working on adapting Shakespeare's plays, we kept asking questions－various questions that could help us to understand the playwright's intention,"" says Li Liuyi, who also works with the Beijing People's Art Theater and whose works cover traditional Chinese operas, avant-garde plays, Western operas and ballet. ""In adapting Hamlet, we were very sincere because it's a classic and so famous. We've been doing rehearsals for two weeks, and we never stop searching for ways to bring out what we perceive to be new discoveries from the classic play."" In 1990, well-known Chinese theater director Lin Zhaohua adapted Hamlet, in which Pu played the leading role. In Li Liuyi's adaptation, Pu plays the role of Claudius and the ghost of King Hamlet. ""Back in 1990, I found my ways to communicate with Hamlet and Shakespeare. It was a psychological drama,"" says Pu, 65. ""This time, I play the character who murders his own brother and then marries the late king's widow. He is very complicated, and I am intrigued by the role."" Chinese actor Hu Jun plays Hamlet in the work. In Lin's adaptation in 1990, Hu played the role of gravedigger. Hu's wife, Lu, plays both the roles of Ophelia and Hamlet's mother Gertrude. The creative team also includes costume designer William Cheung Suk-Ping, Chinese composer Zhou Juan from the Central Conservatory of Music and German set designer Michael Simon.  7:30 pm, Nov 28-Dec 5.

0,"BEIJING - China's growing number of bespectacled youth have caught the attention of national leaders. On Wednesday, the annual National Eye Health Day, Vice Premier Sun Chunlan ordered schools and health departments to do more to prevent shortsightedness among young people. Sun, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, said the central authorities have crafted measures to deal with this specific problem and strict enforcement at local levels is now needed. Health experts say more than 450 million Chinese suffer from shortsightedness, which occurs more often among children and junior adults. Bad reading habits and overuse of electronic devices are to blame. In Beijing alone, 58.6 percent of students in primary and middle schools suffer from poor eyesight, according to a government survey conducted two years ago. The students' eyesight deteriorates as they advance in their studies, the survey has found. A whopping 89.4 percent of senior high students were found to have eyesight problems. When visiting a primary school in central Beijing, Sun said schools should improve infrastructure to ensure a good learning environment and step up supervision to correct bad habits that harm students' eyesight. She said schools are regarded as ""the main battlefield to fight shortsightedness"" because students spend a lot of time on campus. Schools should strictly enforce the twice-a-day eye exercise routine and set aside at least one hour a day for students to do physical activities, Sun ordered. She suggested education authorities add eyesight protection to schools' performance assessments. During her visit to a community health center, Sun urged health workers to set up dossiers to monitor changes in each student's eyesight and intervene as soon as possible to prevent further deterioration, especially acute shortsightedness. ""We should create a good environment in which the government takes overall charge, departments cooperate, experts give guidance, schools educate, and families pay attention,"" Sun said. ""Let every child have a pair of bright eyes for their bright future."""
0,"BEIJING -- The Beijing municipal legislature is discussing amending its fireworks management regulations to ban fireworks all year long in light of the city's heavy air pollution and casualties caused by fireworks during festivals.  A draft amendment on Beijing municipal fireworks safety and management regulations on Thursday was rendered to the standing committee of the Beijing municipal people's congress for deliberation.  According to the draft, setting off fireworks will be banned within the Fifth Ring Road of Beijing.  This means residents in the city proper will not be allowed to use fireworks on the Lunar New Year, China's most important festival of family reunion. Chinese people often celebrate the holiday by setting off fireworks.  According to an official with the legal affairs office of the Beijing municipal government, dozens of people were injured or killed in firework-triggered accidents during the Chinese Lunar New Year between 2015 and 2017.  The number of heavy air pollution days during the seven-day festival reached two to four days each year during the past five years, said the official.  The office solicited public opinion about the draft amendment, with 83.1 percent of participants supporting the ban.  Lawmakers also advised reducing the number of sales booths and cutting off channels for illegal sales of fireworks.  Currently, use of fireworks within Beijing's Fifth Ring Road is allowed only on Chinese Lunar New Year and Lantern Festival."

0,"More and more high net worth individuals are sending their children abroad to study, despite the hefty price tag that comes with an international education. ""The past few years have seen a surge in the number of people studying abroad,"" said Huang Zhongyang, CEO of Special A, a Beijing-based institution specializing in overseas education consulting. ""Last year, 608,400 students went abroad to study, up 11.74 percent year-on-year. The market is huge,"" according to Huang. He said ""almost 100 percent of our clients are high net worth individuals, given that sending children to study abroad means a large amount of money, especially for those who send their kids from high school onward."" ""Undergraduate study abroad costs about 2.5 million yuan ($366,000), while high school education costs even more, considering the expenditure on a nanny, research fees and donations that are required by many high schools,"" Huang said. To get their children into the best schools, parents often spend significant amounts of money on tutoring as well. ""Generally, tutoring fees total 200,000 yuan. For some high-end institutions, the cost is as high as 600,000 yuan,"" according to Huang. A report released by CreditEase Wealth Management and Beijing-based market research company HCR showed that up to 70 percent of interviewed high net worth individuals are either in the process of or have already sent their children abroad to study. ""High net worth individuals want their children to develop independent thinking, expanded vision and fluent language skills through studying abroad,"" said Zhang Yue, senior vice-president at CreditEase. ""The rewards of investment in education are more important than the inheritance of any tangible wealth."" ""Many wealthy people believe that studying abroad - in the United States, for instance - can cultivate children's multidimensional thinking and leadership abilities,"" Huang said. ""Other reasons include improving their children's social circles, fostering their independent living skills and experiencing multinational cultures, which is beneficial to cultivating their way of thinking,"" he said. But, students could encounter many difficulties when studying abroad, such as not being able to adapt to the new environment, as well as language barriers, Huang said."
1,"The consensus that there will be ""no trade war"" — reached during the latest round of trade talks between the world's top two economies — means a lot, not only for the Sino-US economic relationship, but also for the global economy as a whole, according to officials and analysts from both countries. A delegation led by Vice-Premier Liu He, President Xi Jinping's special envoy, had ""positive, pragmatic, constructive and fruitful"" talks on Thursday and Friday with the US team headed by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, following their first round of talks in Beijing early this month. The biggest achievement coming from the latest trade talks is the consensus that there will be no trade war and both sides will stop placing tariffs on one another, Liu said at a news briefing on Saturday. The achievement comes from the previous consensus reached by top leaders of the two countries and is in the interests of the people from both countries and the world, Liu said. The healthy China-US economic and trade ties are in line with the historical trend, Liu said, adding that the two countries should properly handle their differences through dialogue and treat them calmly in the future. Wei Jianguo, former vice-minister of commerce, said the collaboration between Beijing and Washington will be conducive to consumers and businesses of the two countries and it will help fuel the world economy, as the world's top two economies are closely interdependent and intertwined. Wei added that imports of high-quality goods and services from foreign markets including the US will help meet the growing needs for Chinese consumers, and it will help reduce deficit in bilateral trade. The two countries agreed to take measures to reduce the US trade deficit, with China significantly increasing purchases of US goods and services, which will help support growth and employment in the US, according to a joint statement issued on Saturday. They agreed on ""meaningful increases"" in US exports of agricultural and energy products and greater efforts to increase trade in manufactured goods and services, the statement said. In answering the question about what will be followed in the coming months, Liu said the two sides have already established some working groups, including the agricultural group. ""Maybe some ministers from the US government will lead the groups to Beijing"" to have deeper discussions and try to make concrete deals, Liu said. At the media briefing, Liu said China is ready to buy goods from the United States and the rest of the world, answering Xi's call for further market reform and opening-up. Liu said China, with its huge middle-income population, will become the world's largest consumption market. This market will be highly competitive, so nations eyeing for market share have to improve their products and services so that the Chinese consumers would like to buy them, he said. The consensus released after the talks shows that negotiation and collaboration, rather than unilateral trade action, is the right path forward to address economic and trade disputes, experts said. Chen Jiahe, chief strategist at Cinda Securities, said collaboration and cooperation rather than conflict are the mainstream approaches among major countries around the world. Such cooperation will not only benefit people of the two countries but also those in the Asia-Pacific region and around the world, all of whom are interconnected in a globalized economy. Qu Tianshi, China economist at ANZ Group, said the trade talks helped reverse global pessimism about an escalation of a large-scale trade war and it will reduce external uncertainties and create a stable environment for China to push domestic reforms. Wang Huiyao, founder and president of the Center for China and Globalization, said the resolutions reached during this round of trade talks bode well for further improvement of the relations between the two countries. ""It has laid a solid foundation for the resolution of any problems that may arise in bilateral trade relations in the future,"" Wang said. ""This sounds positive that both China and the United States have come to agreement on key issues. I'm sure there will be further discussions to finalize the details,"" said Rick Kimberley, president of Kimberley Farms Inc in Iowa. Vice-Premier Liu offered on Saturday a note of caution that it will take longer to resolve the structural problems in China-US economic and trade relations. While China's import of US goods, such as agricultural products and energy, will both help meet the needs of the Chinese people and bring down the US trade deficit, the US side could do a lot more if it indeed intends to cut its overall trade deficit. Many economists have said that the US trade deficit is a result of US fiscal policy, the low personal savings rate of Americans and the role of the US dollar as a global reserve currency. China has been making greater efforts to increase its imports to meet the growing needs of the Chinese people and for high-quality economic growth. The inaugural 2018 China International Import Expo to be unveiled in Shanghai in November is a major move in that regard."
0,"Child safety experts said efforts to prevent accidents and help children deal with the aftermath of incidents face many challenges in smaller cities and rural regions as a result of traditional ideas and a lack of educators in the field. In recent years, Cui Minyan, chief representative of the China office of the NGO Safe Kids Worldwide, has led a team that travels around the country providing information about the importance of safety features, such as baby seats in cars. She has found that the response in rural areas is very different to that in cities and towns. ""In big cities such as Shanghai and Beijing, large numbers of parents stop and listen to our open-air lectures, but audience numbers are lower in small cities and rural areas,"" she said. Experts have noted that more accidents occur in rural areas than in urban spaces. A survey of about 2,400 youngsters in Beijing age 14 and younger showed that 190 urban residents and 215 children from the capital's rural areas were involved in accidents in 2014, according to a report in the journal Occupational Health and Emergency Rescue. The experts said parents in larger cities are usually more open minded as a result of a higher level of education and easy access to information about providing safe environments for children. ""However, in smaller places people may be influenced by peer pressure and reject suggestions that they should take precautions against safety hazards. Very often they say, 'I don't know anyone who is taking such precautions,'"" said Li Hao, director of the Trauma Treatment Center at the Children's Hospital of Fudan University in Shanghai. Residents of smaller cities and rural areas are also more likely to be influenced by traditional concepts; for example, many believe that holding a baby in their arms is safer than strapping them into baby seats, according to the experts. Cui recalled the reaction when her team visited a hospital in a second-tier city to explain the importance of using baby seats in cars. ""The parents looked at us with astonishment. The expression in their eyes was as if they were saying 'No way',"" she said. Child safety experts also encourage schools in small cities and rural areas to provide specific safety education for students rather than simply reading out bulletins on the school address system outlining the dangers of playing in or near water during hot summer weather. Cui said schools can download and use a number of online teaching aids designed for children of different ages produced by NGOs and voluntary organizations. For example, an online behavior-oriented educational package produced by Safe Kids Worldwide has been used by schools in Shanghai, Beijing and Shijiazhuang, Hebei province, for several years. ""Our classes are not just about giving instruction. We aim to prompt changes in behavior and the formation of new habits through learning and repeated practice,"" Cui said She explained that when the NGO teaches students about road safety, the points are illustrated by the use of model cars placed in the school playground to simulate the scene when a child crosses the road. It is important to separate the sequence of events because in real life people undertake actions step by step, she said. ""We must make children clearly understand the points at which they must look left and then look right before they start crossing. It's important for them to remember that they should only cross when they have assessed the situation on the street and made sure that drivers have seen them."" She encouraged schools and kindergartens in large cities to share their good safety practices and experience - such as how to prevent accidents in crowded corridors - with schools in rural regions."
1,"Foreign investors will play a bigger role in driving Beijing's property investment market this year due to their increasing financing activities in Asia, industry experts said. In its largest-ever fundraising activity, US private equity firm Blackstone raised $7.1 billion to invest in real estate across Asia. UK-based real estate asset manager AEW Capital Management also announced that it had raised $1.2 billion for an Asia-Pacific property fund that includes Beijing as a target market. ""As foreign investors become more active in Asia, we expect to see them buy more assets in China, especially Beijing,"" said Michael Wang, head of capital markets for North China in JLL. ""Meanwhile, as the financing conditions tighten for domestic players this year, foreign investors will have a bigger chance than before."" The Postal Savings Bank of China, for an instance, has purchased the new Everbright Center built in Tongzhou, Beijing, for 4 billion yuan ($597 million), the highest profile transaction in Beijing during the second quarter. The performance of Beijing's bulk property investment market in the first half of 2018 was flat, with only 14 transactions amounting to 10.2 billion yuan, a 50 percent year-on-year decrease, according to a report from Savills. That said, institutional investors are still eyeing Beijing's real estate opportunities, especially those that are scarce in high-quality locations or those that have stable rental returns, according to Savills. According to Wang from JLL, the volume of institutions' investments into Beijing's property this year will probably exceed last year's 25 billion yuan, according to JLL's report."

Xi said in the meeting that Beijing will strive to present the world with a green, shared, open and incorruptible 2022 Games. He said the Chinese government has zero tolerance toward doping and Chinese athletes should win a clean gold medal for the Olympic spirit and obey rules and laws even if they are unable to win a gold medal. China considers preparations for the Beijing Winter Olympics to be of great importance, and work on all fronts is moving forward steadily. China has transformed itself into a leading contender in many sports, an important indicator of the country's improved national strength, he added. The greater visibility of winter sports and improvements in public health align with China's ""Two Centenary Goals""－to build a moderately prosperous society and to become a modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced and harmonious－Xi said. He added that hosting the Beijing Winter Olympics will bring opportunities for China to advance in international sports cooperation. Xi said China's concepts for hosting the Winter Olympics are in line with the joint building of the Belt and Road, the promotion of green civilization development and the country's anti-corruption drive. Sports exchanges are increasingly becoming a part of China's exchanges with countries involved in the Belt and Road Initiative, he said. Bach, who visited proposed venues for the Games in Zhangjiakou, Hebei province, and in Beijing before the meeting, said he was deeply impressed with the pragmatic, efficient, vitalized preparations. He said he has seen Chinese athletes' diligent preparations as well as proposed venues combining the legacies of the 2008 Summer Olympics with sustainable development and the public expressing enthusiasm for winter sports. Bach said the preparation and hosting of the Olympics will help promote winter sports in China and the world, adding that China's concepts as host are in line with those of the IOC. He also expressed satisfaction over the mutual trust and cooperation between the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics organizing committee and the IOC. He said he is confident that China will host a wonderful Winter Olympics."
1,"China praises the latest positive comments made by the United States regarding the issue related to Chinese telecommunication giant ZTE Corp, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said on Monday. Beijing will keep close contact with Washington over the details, the spokesman told a Monday news conference when asked about a recent tweet by US President Donald Trump about the ZTE case. Trump said on Twitter on Sunday about giving ZTE ""a way to get back into business, fast"", adding he has instructed the US Department of Commerce ""to get it done."" China and the US have also maintained close contact over some specific concerns from the US, Lu added. ZTE was forced to suspend its main operations worldwide after the US Commerce Department banned American companies from exporting products to it in mid-April. US companies that supply chips and other components to ZTE are experiencing sizable revenue loss after the United States imposed a denial of export privileges, according to Xinhua news agency."
0,"Most expectant mothers discover potential problems with the fetus through screenings, whose accuracy ranges from 80 to 99 percent, according to Zhu Haiyan, director of the Prenatal Diagnostic Center at the PLA Navy General Hospital in Beijing. In the United States, noninvasive prenatal testing, or NIPT, is usually conducted after the 10th week of pregnancy. In China, however, guidelines issued by the National Health Commission recommend conducting the test between the 12th and 20th weeks to guarantee the blood samples contain an adequate amount of DNA, she said. Yu Jun, former deputy head of the Beijing Institute of Genomics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said NIPT is not only used to detect chromosomal anomalies but can also recognize the DNA signatures of thousands of genetic illnesses. Deafness and Down syndrome, the two most common chromosomal disorders among Chinese newborns, are screened via genetic testing. ""The higher the number of genetic signatures screened, the higher the cost of the test. However, new technologies and technical advances should lower costs in the future,"" he said. ""Several hundred genetic tests are in use, and more are being developed. Future tests will look for mutations related to disease risks beyond rare genetic disorders－that is, common illnesses such as cancers, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases."" In the past decade, gene technology has advanced rapidly in China, with many companies developing genesequencing equipment and a number of larger outfits building their own gene banks. Berry Genomics began offering genomic sequencing services for genetic diseases in 2010. The company has also been building a gene data pool since 2015, and now has the details of more than 1 million people in China, according to CEO Zhou Daixing. Under strict privacy protection, the data is only used for scientific studies and clinical research. ""As precision medicine has been promoted globally in recent years, gene testing will play a key role in both the development of new drugs and the formulation of personalized medical treatment plans,"" he said. He added that the frequency of genetic mutation varies among different racial groups, and some Western countries that have studied their genetic composition for decades already have national databases. ""Building our own Chinese gene bank would be helpful,"" Zhou said. Based on current data analysis, he said that the company has already discovered the frequency of a number of genetic mutations prevalent in different parts of the country. ""If future healthcare policies, such as screening plans, can be devised according to those differences, we could reduce the healthcare budget, and significantly improve the efficiency of screening,"" he said."
0,"A decade in development, Peking Opera star Zhang Huoding's adaptation of the classic Farewell My Concubine in the Cheng style is nothing short of a dream come true, Chen Nan reports. ""One of my biggest dreams started more than 10 years ago, and now it's coming true,"" said Peking Opera star Zhang Huoding in a rehearsal room of the National Academy of Chinese Theatre Arts on April 23. For the past year, she has been practicing and working on adapting the classic Peking Opera piece, Farewell My Concubine, from the same rehearsal room. With the collaboration of 77-year-old Peking Opera artist Gao Mukun and 78-year-old composer Wan Ruixing, Zhang's rendition of Farewell My Concubine will premiere at the Chang'an Grand Theater in Beijing on May 25. In October, the show will be staged in Shanghai. Telling the love story between Xiang Yu, a warlord of the Chu Kingdom, and his concubine, Yu Ji, the classic Peking Opera is one of the most famous pieces of the 200-year-old art form, which combines singing, dancing, martial arts and acrobatics. Adapted from the Kunqu Opera piece, Qian Jin Ji, written by Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) writer Shen Cai, Farewell My Concubine was first performed by Peking Opera masters Yang Xiaolou (1878-1938) and Shang Xiaoyun (1900-1976) in Beijing in 1918. In 1922, Peking Opera master Mei Lanfang (1894-1961), along with Yang, performed the piece, which later became one of the most famous works in Mei's repertoire. The piece is also regarded as one of the most classic pieces of the ""Mei school"", the performing style he developed.,Zhang was trained by Peking Opera master Zhao Rongchen and keeps up the traditions of the ""Cheng school"", a performing style founded by Cheng Yanqiu (1904-58)－one of the four major performing styles of Peking Opera that emerged in the early 20th century. Like Mei, Cheng mastered the techniques of men playing female roles, known as nandan. The ""Cheng school"" is known for interpreting tragic female roles with frequent changes in rhythm. ""Farewell My Concubine is well-known for being performed in the style of Mei. Now, I am adapting it to the performing style of Cheng, which is very challenging. The two styles of tones, gestures and movements are very different. There have been many occasions over the past 10 years when I considered dropping the idea of adapting the piece entirely, but the notion just lingered in my mind,"" says Zhang. Born in Baicheng, Northeast China's Jilin province, Zhang was introduced to traditional Chinese opera by her father, who was a performer of Pingju Opera, a traditional opera form popular in northern China. Her elder brother, Zhang Huoqian, began studying Peking Opera as a child. Zhang Huoding was trained to play qingyi－""graceful female roles"". Zhang Huoding fell in love with Farewell My Concubine after she was enrolled to study Peking Opera at an art school in Tianjin at the age of 15. ""The loyalty and love she felt for her man really touched me,"" says Zhang of the role, Yu Ji. When Xiang Yu realizes that he has lost his battle and is ready to spend his last night with Yu Ji, the concubine kills herself with Xiang Yu's sword to express her faithfulness. In 1989, after graduating from the school in Tianjin, Zhang joined a military Peking Opera troupe in Beijing. From 1995 to 2008, she performed with the National Peking Opera Company. The 48-year-old now teaches at the National Academy of Chinese Theater Arts in Beijing. In 2016, the academy launched a project that enabled Zhang to mentor young female Peking Opera students of the Cheng style.,Zhang Huoding says when she wanted to adapt Farewell My Concubine about 10 years ago, she invited Peking Opera artist Gao, her former colleague from the National Peking Opera Company, to play the role of Xiang Yu. ""About a year ago, when I told him that the adaptation will finally come to fruition, Gao accepted the role at once. He kept his promise for 10 years,"" Zhang Huoding says. ""Since Farewell My Concubine is a very popular work for Peking Opera audiences, we keep to the original script and only make changes to the piece based on the Cheng performing style,"" says Wan the composer. Wan, who started writing music in 1963, has worked with Zhang Huoding on many of her famous works, including the Peking Opera classic, The Legend of the White Snake, and the contemporary Peking Opera work, Jiang Jie. One of the most famous parts of the piece is the sword dance, which was Mei's signature creation. This is the scene where Yu Ji dances with Xiang Yu's sword on their last night before she kills herself with it. ""The sword is an important element of the piece. Zhang Huoding choreographed the sword dance, which is as elaborate as it is creative,"" says Wan. The Peking Opera piece, Farewell My Concubine by Zhang Huoding, will close this year's Meet in Beijing Arts Festival, the capital's largest annual celebration of dance, music, drama and art. In 2015 and 2016, Zhang Huoding closed the festival with shows of The Jewelry Pouch and The Legend of the White Snake. In 2015, she also made her debut in the United States with performances at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York."

The baby-friendly facility consists of three private breastfeeding rooms, mother-and-baby toilet and a baby-themed souvenir shop with female staff members providing necessary services for visitors. The facility is located at the west side of the square near the Gate of Heavenly Purity, the main gate of the Inner Court of the Palace Museum. Inside, the rooms are full of decorations with cartoon images of China's traditional ancient divine animals, there are bottle warmers, booster seats as well as baby changing stations available in the room. The courtyard besides the facility is also equipped with a slide for children to play. Shan Jixiang, director of the Palace Museum said considering the inconvenience of many mothers who take their babies to visit the palace museum, they reduced their business scope and set up the baby caring room to cater to the need of the visitors. So far, nearly 300 mothers have benefited from the service."
0,"Do To Hoa, a graduate student from Vietnam at the China Conservatory of Music in Beijing. Every time I sing the song I love you, China, I feel it expresses the feelings in my heart. When I first came to China in 2013, I thought it would be a good thing if I could become a music teacher at a university back in Vietnam after graduation. But now, I really hope I can do more things and become a cultural bridge between the two countries, making a contribution to a closer China-Vietnam friendship. I remember how President Xi Jinping encouraged me to play the role of peace envoy between China and Vietnam in 2017 after I sang On the Hopeful Field (a popular song in the 1980s) during his visit to Vietnam. Actually it was not the first time I had sung for him. Back in 2015, when President Xi visited Vietnam, I performed two Chinese folk songs for the leaders of China and Vietnam as a junior student at Guangxi Arts University. After the performance, Xi's wife, Peng Liyuan, spoke with me. She asked where I studied and the name of my teacher, which made me very happy because I know she is a famous singer in China. For me, it is great to study in China because I fell in love with Chinese folk songs when I was very young and it is my dream to study vocal music every day. I think I have a great link with China because I learn Chinese folk songs very quickly and my voice is quite suitable for them. I'm very thankful to my family, which has been very supportive since I came to China. My father died of heart disease in 2016 when I was participating in a singing competition hosted by China Central Television and I could not go home immediately. But when he was ill, my father told me, ""It is your dream to sing, so you should continue in the contest and perform well, so that our Chinese friends will better understand our culture."" As a result, I worked very, very hard. Now, my younger brother bears the burden of taking care of my mom and the whole family, which gives me the opportunity to continue pursuing my dream in China. My family members have never visited China, but I hope they can come to Beijing and attend my concerts during my graduate study in the near future. Many of my friends in Vietnam said I have become increasingly like a Chinese. That's a good thing, isn't it? Do To Hoa spoke with Mo Jingxi."
0,"The final construction work for Beijing Daxing International Airport Expressway and the central section of Daxing Airport North Line Expressway will finish by the end of June, according to the latest message released by the Beijing Municipal Commission of Transport on Monday.  Beijing Daxing International Airport Expressway, a two-way eight-lane motorway, spans approximately 27 kilometers. It covers the area from the South Fifth Ring Road to the northern perimeter of Daxing International Airport. Construction started in November 2016 and was primarily completed in December 2018, but it will not be ready for operation until the end of this month. Beijing Daxing International Airport Expressway will allow passengers to travel from the airport to South Fifth Ring Road in just 20 minutes, which will vastly improve the efficiency of service at Daxing International Airport, and at the same time, provide more transportation options for residents, easing the pressure of overcrowded traffic in the southern part of the city. Daxing Airport North Line Expressway is designed to cover 24.58 kilometers, connecting Hebei province, the airport and Beijing. Its central section, which links Jingkai (Beijing-Kaifeng) Expressway and Jingtai (Beijing-Taipei) Expressway, is 14.66 kilometers long. Construction started in December 2017, and its completion is anticipated at the end of this month. In fact, both highways are a part of the key transportation network designed to support the operations of Beijing Daxing International Airport. With four expressways, this network aims to optimize the road structure around the newly built airport to facilitate the smooth opening and future operations of the airfield. Upon completion, the two motorways are expected to be fully functional and prepared for operation. At present, construction of the two expressway projects has entered the final stage — the construction team is working to enhance the lighting function of toll stations and highway lamps, as well as to sketch out the roadmaps for traffic and landscape plating in the central section of the airport's North Line Expressway to ensure the timeliness and quality of expressway construction at the end of this month."
1,"Editor's Note: On Friday, the ongoing Fifth World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, Zhejiang province, will hold a forum on ""5G Era: Opening and Cooperation for a Better Future"". In the run-up to the key event, in interviews with China Daily, industry luminaries recalled how China's sustained R&D efforts have helped the nation maintain its pioneering role in evolving 5G mobile communication technology, related standards and the licensing phase. Chinese telecom companies are seeking to maintain their lead in the global race for 5G commercialization. They are stepping up research and development of the fifth-generation mobile communication technology, which is said to be at least 10 times faster than 4G services. They are also deepening partnerships with various industries to roll out commercial services sooner than later, industry insiders said. For instance, China Mobile Communications Corp, the world's largest telecom carrier with more than 910 million mobile subscribers, is planning to combine 5G with artificial intelligence and cloud technology for an ultramodern network that is slated for a 2020 rollout. The company has played a significant role in the finalization of the first phase of global 5G standards, which kicked off the head stretch toward commercial 5G services. Shang Bing, chairman of China Mobile, said: ""We will focus on the standalone 5G network structure, push forward the cloud deployment of the superfast technology and build an intelligent network by boosting the operational efficiency with AI."" According to him, the company will establish a 5G innovation fund to promote the development and maturity of full-fledged industrial applications of 5G. The senior executive did not elaborate on the specific investment size of the fund. But he said the Beijing-based company is vigorously conducting 5G trials in several cities and will start pre-commercial use of 5G in 2019 before the planned commercial launch in 2020. The new technology will enable superfast downloads of ""heavy"" files like movies, self-driving cars and streaming of virtual reality games. ""Telecom operators must accelerate the transformation toward smart networks, lean management and platform services, so as to prepare for the 5G era,"" Shang said. China is expected to have 576 million 5G users by 2025, or over 40 percent of global consumption, according to a report released by global consultancy EY earlier this month. The report, titled China is Poised to Win the 5G Race, estimated that the nation's 5G capital expenditure is expected to hit 1.5 trillion yuan ($223 billion) between 2019 and 2025. Proactive government support and big-ticket investments have helped shape a self-sustainable 5G environment in China, it added. With the global unified standard set to be finalized in the next year or so, China is likely to advance its target for the commercial launch of 5G connections to 2019, to potentially become one of the first 5G-ready markets in the world, EY forecast. Besides China Mobile, smaller telecom carriers including China Telecommunications Corp and China United Network Communications Group Co Ltd are moving fast to upgrade their networks. China Telecom said it will conduct scale trials of 5G applications in 17 cities. The State-owned company will also set up 5G innovation centers to accelerate R&D. ""Cross-industry cooperation is needed to speed up the maturity of 5G. China Telecom will step up efforts to push forward such collaboration,"" Yang Jie, chairman of China Telecom, said. ""We aim to launch commercial 5G services in 2020."" At an expo jointly held by China Telecom and the US chip giant Qualcomm Inc in Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong province, in September, the telecom carrier launched an action plan called Hello 5G to promote an ecosystem where companies from diverse sectors can join hands for growth. Similarly, China Unicom said it will start 5G testing this year, precommercialize 5G in 2019 and finally achieve large-scale commercialization in 2020. Ma Hongbing, general manager of operations and maintenance at China Unicom, said 16 cities, including Beijing, Xiongan, Shenyang and Qingdao, will see large-scale 5G testing this year. All these efforts follow the rollout of favorable policies by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, China's regulator, which is seeking to expedite the development of 5G. Wang Zhiqin, head of a 5G promotion group under the MIIT, said the second half of 2019 could well be the earliest that China may issue 5G licenses. ""We will be among the first batch of countries to issue 5G licenses in the world, most likely between the second half of 2019 and the first half of 2020,"" said Wang, who is also the vice-president of the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, a government think tank affiliated to the MIIT. In the past, China lagged other countries in issuing 4G and 3G licenses. But in 5G, the nation has already played an important role in finalizing the global standards and raced ahead in R&D. ""Frequency bands are likely to be distributed to telecom carriers before the end of this year, which will accelerate the construction of 5G networks,"" Wang said. According to her, medium-frequency bands will be used for 5G networks in the country; and two of the country's three big telecom carriers, namely China Mobile and China Telecom, preferred to build standalone 5G networks from the very beginning, in contrast to the United States and South Korea where companies are building non-standalone 5G networks. Non-standalone 5G deployment offers a way for companies to set up 5G stations by partially relying on the existing 4G network infrastructure while standalone architecture would require completely new structures. ""The cost of building a 5G base station will be at least 1.5 times that of a 4G base station, which will put pressure on telecom carriers,"" Wang said. ""But the trend to innovate and apply 5G in a wide range of industries will motivate them to move fast."" Agreed Steve Lo, managing partner of EY's technology, media and telecommunications division for the region. ""Proactive government support and investments in capital goods have helped shape a self-sustainable 5G environment in China,"" Lo said. ""China is determined to make 5G a top priority on its national agenda, striving to take a leadership role in the global landscape. It is also pressing for participation in the formulation of the international 5G standard to make China one of the main players."" By now, China has neared the completion of its third-phase of 5G testing, thanks to the participation of both domestic companies such as Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and foreign enterprises such as Ericsson AB. The goal is to get pre-commercial system products ready by the end of this year. Liu Xuan, an employee of Shenzhen-based BGI, China's top gene-sequencing provider, said the company is engaged in a project using 5G technology to enhance medical services in remote areas. ""We are experimenting how to help doctors do sonograms for patients thousands of miles away by tapping into the superfast speed and extremely fast responses of 5G,"" Liu said."

China has a long history of mirror culture, dating back to the late Neolithic Age. The ancient poem   has sentences that portray a woman primping in front of a mirror. With the introduction of Western glass mirrors in the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), the shapes, structures and decorations of Chinese mirrors became highly diverse. Some mirrors were even placed into jade pendants so that people could carry them everywhere. Let's take a look at the various mirrors in the Forbidden City."
1,"China should attach more importance to the development of the digital economy by strengthening internet-related laws and the protection of intellectual property rights as the new form of economy is expected to account for 35 percent of the country's GDP by 2020, experts said on Tuesday. The nation's top leadership, led by President Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, have urged the country to accelerate development of the digital economy and cutting-edge technologies, such as artificial intelligence and big data, to better serve the real economy and pursue high-quality development. Xi on Oct 31 urged the country to make more efforts to develop the new generation of artificial intelligence (AI) to promote the country's high-quality economic growth. He also said on Monday in Shanghai at the China International Import Expo that the world should make good use of the opportunities brought by the new round of technological revolution and industrial transformation, and strengthen cooperation in digital economy and AI. Dong Xinyi, an expert at the Law School of the Central University of Finance and Economics said: ""The principle of law-based development should be abided by in the development of the digital economy to ensure its stable growth."" Dong said much attention should be paid to such legal issues as internet security, personal information protection, consumer protection and the duties of internet platforms. Based on the experiences of other major economies in developing the digital economy, China should strengthen regulation of the internet economy, punish internet piracy, and promote the protection of intellectual property rights, said Wang Haochen, an economist with the State Information Center. China can also draw lessons from developed economies and draft industrial development plans for the digital economy, Wang was quoted by the Outlook magazine as saying. China's digital economy has expanded at a fast pace. In 2017, its scale amounted to 27.2 trillion yuan ($3.93 trillion), accounting for 32.9 percent of the country's GDP and being 2.6 percentage points higher than the previous year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. The country's e-commerce transactions, meanwhile, reached 29.2 trillion yuan last year and they had grown by 29.8 percent on average each year in the 2014-17 period, the bureau said. By 2020, the share of China's digital economy in its GDP may rise to 35 percent and its scale may increase to 32 trillion yuan, said Qi Yudong, an economist at Beijing Normal University. By 2030, the share could exceed 50 percent, Qi said. In terms of AI development, China aims to grow its core AI industries to over 150 billion yuan by 2020, 400 billion yuan by 2025, and 1 trillion yuan by 2030. Tang Xiao'ou, founder of Sense-Time and a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said scientific planning is needed to widen the use of AI. ""Technology is not an independent industry. It must be tightly associated with traditional sectors to unleash its potential and to boost efficiency,"" he said. ""More efforts are needed to strengthen the partnership between State-owned and private companies when exploring the application of AI,"" Tang said. Xi stressed on Oct 31 that China is in urgent need of major technological innovation such as the new generation of AI as the nation's economy has been transitioning from rapid growth to high-quality development－a pivotal stage for changing the economic growth model, improving the economic structure and fostering new growth drivers. AI should play an important role in the reform for better quality, higher efficiency and more robust drivers of growth, Xi said."

0,"Iconic auteur Chen Kaige clearly remembers the events of Oct 16, 1964, when he was walking home after school in downtown Beijing. Then a sudden flood of pedestrians carried him along to Wangfujing Street, around four kilometers from his school. When then 12-year-old Chen looked up, he saw copies of People's Daily being thrown into the air, with the front page headline ""China successfully explodes its first atomic bomb"". Chen, now 66, reveals this at a recent Beijing event to announce a new film titled   (I and My Motherland). Besides Chen, the first Chinese director to win the Cannes Film Festival's top honor, the Palme d'Or, for Farewell My Concubine in 1993, the upcoming film also features six other directors - Guan Hu (Mr Six); Xue Xiaolu (Finding Mr Right); Xu Zheng (Lost in Thailand); Ning Hao (Crazy Alien); Wen Muye (Dying to Survive); and Zhang Yibai (I Belonged to You). The film, comprising seven short stories, respectively, each made by one of the featured directors, is being produced by Huaxia Film Distribution Co Ltd to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Huang Jianxin, also an established filmmaker who is the chief producer, says: ""I feel thrilled to work with these excellent filmmakers. It's a rare moment."" Huang says all the directors are passionate about the project, and they plan to discuss the scripts, film sets and casts in the coming weeks.,""The film is about historic moments and collective memories that are etched in our minds,"" says Huang, who in recent years has produced blockbusters such as Operation Mekong. Meanwhile, Chen says the film will feature China's achievements in the past seven decades and the Chinese drive for a better future. The other six directors also share their most memorable historic moments. Wen recalls the moment when he entered the film industry in 2015, when Ning recruited him to direct and write the script of Dying to Survive, which became a phenomenal hit in 2018. ""I had written the script over three months but then felt completely clueless."" Wen then turned on the television set and found that most channels were broadcasting live the military parade to mark the 70th anniversary of the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression (1931-45). ""When I turned off the TV I found myself reinvigorated. I finally understood why the young generation feel safe and confident,"" says Wen about the parade that refueled him with energy to return to the writing of Dying to Survive which shot him to fame. For Ning, one of the most commercially successful directors in China, his most memorable moment was seven days after the Wenchuan earthquake on May 12, 2008. When he and his colleagues were at the office, a series of car horns drew their attention. Then with more and more vehicles joining the chorus they realized that it was a collective mourning of the deaths as tradition demanded. ""At that moment you could feel that everyone's heart was connected,"" says Ning. Fu Ruoqing, the chairman of Huaxia Film, says the company got the idea to make the film around four months ago and says it will be very inspirational. The film is scheduled to open across the mainland during the National Day holiday week in early October."

Wagner's version retells the haunting story of an undead ship captain doomed to an endless journey across the seas. His wandering will not cease until he can find and keep a faithful and true love - an accomplishment put even further out of reach, considering he can only come ashore once every seven years.

0,"Major facilities of the new international airport in Beijing are 80 percent complete, with the airport to be put into use before Sept 30, local authorities said on Saturday. Gao Aiping, deputy general manager of the Beijing Daxing International Airport engineering department, said the airport is built on eight pillars with 63,450 circular steel tubes, which support the roof of the terminals. Many bubble windows are scattered throughout the C-shaped pillars to make better use of natural lighting. ""We assembled some aluminum-made glass to conserve energy,"" he said, adding that glass with aluminum netting can reflect 70 percent of the sunlight. Moreover, the strength of the glass on the airport's rooftop adds more protection to the entire terminal building. ""The glass has three layers, and each layer of the glass is 12 centimeters thick with tempered glass on the top layer,"" Gao said. So far, the ground granite stone paving for the new airport has been 80 percent completed, with the ceiling project 95 percent finished, according to the engineering department. The air conditioners, water pumps and firefighting equipment had been going through the adjusting process, Gao said. In March, after Spring Festival, the engineering department will conduct a joint adjustment activity on the entire airport infrastructure. The central area of the new airport terminal covers a total of 180,000 square meters, with the ceiling of the entire terminal building measuring 300,000 square meters, exceeding the area of 400 football fields.

1,"Aihuishou.com, one of China's largest electronics recycling platforms, plans to build a global online marketplace for trading secondhand digital items, marking an initial move to make inroads into overseas markets. The Shanghai-based company will invest approximately $200 million to develop the platform and push for global expansion, Chen Xuefeng, CEO of the Shanghai-based company, said at a recent news conference in Beijing. ""The company is looking for suitable investment targets in Indonesia, Thailand and the United States,"" Chen said. So far, Aihuishou has already reached strategic cooperation with major trade markets for used digital products, such as Hong Kong, Dubai, Miami, India, Russia and Brazil. The platform, called Paijitang, could provide international sellers and buyers with improved services for secondhand electronic products such as disposal, standard rating and purchase, Chen said. According to data from international information provider IDC and market research institute GFK, global mobile phone shipments exceeded 1.5 billion units in 2017, and secondhand phones are generally resold three to four times, which indicates huge potential in the sector. There are major bottlenecks in trading secondhand digital products around the globe - consumer demand varies from region to region, and traditional trading models are relatively inefficient, according to Chen. Earlier this year, Aihuishou made investments in Cashify, an Indian online marketplace for used smartphones and electronics, as well as Brazilian counterpart Trocafone. These partnerships would enable these target companies to learn from Aihuishou's cutting-edge technologies, and bring about operational efficiencies into their business, Chen said. On Wednesday, Aihuishou announced the launch of intelligent recycling machines that can facilitate users in recycling their secondhand items. ""Within only one minute, the user can get some of the collection money from Aihuishou via their Alipay account (a popular e-payment system in China). The whole process of collection and transaction takes about three days,"" said Ni Chun, vice-president of Aihuishou. The company aims to deploy about 10,000 intelligent recycling machines in first-tier cities including Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, Guangdong province, within one year, according to Ni. To date, Aihuishou has set up five operation centers and more than 260 recycling stores mainly in China's first and second-tier cities. Chen said that by the end of 2018, the number of physical stores will exceed 400. Li Yinan, an analyst at China Co-Harmony Investment Fund Management Co, said that companies that trade used products need to establish a sound and sustainable strategy. ""There is tremendous market potential ahead. But the profit margin is relatively low, so online-to-offline startups in this sector need large-scale operations,"" Li said."
1,"After a recent online video of an MMA, or mixed martial arts, fighter taking down a tai chi master within 13 seconds went viral, netizens engaged in a fierce discussion on whether tai chi could be effective in combat at all and if it would survive more popular modern martial art forms such as kung fu. ""I will open arms to any tai chi master who dares to challenge me,"" yelled the MMA champion Xu Xiaodong after his victory. His rant added fuel to online fire of tai chi's critics who believe MMA, boxing, kung fu and muay thai are far ahead as combat sports. But some experts say that is just one way of looking at the issue. ""Tai chi has many varieties and what people are practising nowadays is an exercise to improve mental health,"" said Liu Haoming, owner of San Feng Tai Chi Club, a Beijing-based school. Jack Ma, founder of e-commerce giant Alibaba Group and one of the richest persons in China, backs tai chi. ""It is not for combat, but MMA is. For combat, MMA indeed is faster and more efficient, but tai chi is not only about skills, it's also about its inherent philosophy."" In the face of mounting competition from alternative mind-body disciplines, tai chi is passing through what can be called both the best age and the worst phase, said Liu. ""With the country backing traditional martial arts, tai chi has the potential to shine. Also, more foreigners have been visiting Beijing since 2008 to learn tai chi, which helps popularize the gem of our culture around the world."" Liu said he has been teaching tai chi to foreigners since 2008, and many of his students are serious about mastering it as they are aware it can calm their mind as well as provide a good workout. ""However, tai chi requires some exclusive time and an open space with clean air. Urban people usually don't have much patience or time to practise tai chi."" Yet, some martial art masters believe tai chi, being a window on Chinese culture, will have a bright future ahead. ""I believe not only China but the world will gradually appreciate the beauty of tai chi,"" said Zhang Yujun, founder of Fenghuang Taiji Academy, a non-profit tai chi school. ""Tai chi teachers will have a bigger market as the martial art can help urban workers to relax."""
0,"Beijing has mapped out the operations plan for several ground traffic routes to facilitate operations at the city's new airport - Beijing Daxing International Airport - which is scheduled to open in September 2019. According to a report in the Beijing-based newspaper The Mirror on Wednesday, the new airport expressway will be available for traffic in May. The new airport north line expressway will be available for traffic in 2019. Meanwhile, the Beijing–Xiong'an high-speed railway and the new subway line linking the airport and downtown in the initial phase will be ready for traffic in May. The four traffic routes, added to the completed Beijing-Taipei Expressway and the extension of the Beijing-Kaifeng Expressway, as well as the intercity railway's first phase that is under construction, forms a transport network around the airport known as ""five vertical - two horizon."" Construction on the new airport started in December 2014. It is 46 kilometers from Tian'anmen Square, 67 km from Beijing Capital International Airport and 55 km from Xiongan New Area. The roof of the main terminal building was successfully sealed in January. Airfield construction is nearly complete and the road overpass was fully connected in May. Construction of ground refueling facilities will come into use in April 2019. It is designed to take pressure off the overcrowded Beijing Capital International Airport in the northeastern suburbs, and as a new engine to propel development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei cluster. The new airport is expected to handle 72 million passenger trips, 630,000 departures and arrivals, and 2 million metric tons of cargo and mail annually by 2025. In a long-term goal, it is expected to handle more than 100 million passengers a year, with 880,000 takeoffs and landings annually."
0,"I came to Beijing last fall to teach for the University of Colorado Denver, part of the program at the International College of Beijing, located on China Agricultural University's east campus. While my husband and son stayed in the US, I brought my 12-year-old daughter with me. We felt it would be a wonderful opportunity for her to experience another culture, learn another language, and generally expand her horizons. We were hopeful that she would make some Chinese friends her own age, figuring that girls her age would be naturally curious and anxious to share their experiences. What we have found here has been a little bit different.   The biggest problem my daughter has had making friends is finding people her age who have a little bit of time to spare. We have learned that childhood in China is different than childhood in the United States. In the US, children spend several hours each day in school and then, typically, participate in one or two other activities, such as soccer or piano lessons. Most have at least a couple of weekday afternoons free along with most weekends. They spend this time making friends, playing games, and pursuing their own leisure interests in an unstructured fashion. My daughter is fond of playing on the local volleyball team and spending time with her friends, often walking to a local shop for a soda, jumping on the trampoline, or watching a movie. She also likes to draw, paint, and write poetry. Chinese students' lives are different. Once they begin school, their time is not their own. Like their US counterparts, they spend several hours each day in school. Then they have homework, far more homework than US students. This takes them several more hours. Then they have their outside activities, such as piano lessons, math club, English lessons, and art class. Virtually all of their time is planned and scheduled, leaving them little or no leisure time to spend with friends their own age or to explore new interests. Perhaps this is why we so seldom see our neighbor children outside of their trips to and from school. Perhaps this is why my daughter has made no Chinese friends (just a few other expatriates) and is anxious to return to her public school in the US next fall. In the time we've spent in Beijing, my daughter and I have had some wonderful experiences. We have seen some of this great country, we have experienced a new and different culture, and we have learned a bit of the local language. We have made friends, both expatriates and locals, but all are grown. One advantage to this is my young daughter has matured rapidly and learned to adapt to adult conversation and company. While I'm looking forward to returning to Beijing next fall, I expect I'll be returning alone."

China and Tajikistan should strengthen the synergy between the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and Tajikistan's national development strategy for the period up to 2030, and deepen cooperation in fields including trade, investment, finance, connectivity, culture and security, Xi said. Efforts should be made to enhance the capability of customs clearance and transportation to create favorable conditions for expanding trade between the two countries, he said. China encourages its companies to invest and do business in Tajikistan to support the country's industrialization, Xi said. Rahmon said the BRI is of global significance and will help Taikistan achieve industrialization. Tajikistan is an early supporter of the BRI, and is actively aligning its national development strategy with the Chinese initiative, Rahmon said."

The post, titled ""September 1, happy 30th anniversary of the marriage of Mr Xi and Ms Peng"", includes anecdotes from the marriage. It appeared on the accounts on social networks WeChat and Sina Weibo.  The weibo account suiyuan zhaji (journals with Yuan) has 1.88 million followers.

Starting this year, the alliance will annually host concerts, workshops and exhibitions over three days.  More than 70 musicians and scholars from 16 countries, including India, Thailand, Vietnam, Turkey and Uzbekistan, will attend the inaugural conference along with their Chinese peers.  Top representatives from at least 10 music schools in the country are also expected to participate.  The Belt and Road Initiative announced by President Xi Jinping in 2013 aims to revitalize economic, cultural and other links along the ancient Silk Road between China and other parts of the world.  ""The Silk Road, which linked traders, pilgrims, monks, nomads and others, was not only a trade route but was also important for the development of Chinese culture and civilization,"" Yu says.  ""Music is an important bridge, too. We want to strengthen understanding and promote cultural exchanges among the countries through this conference,"" he adds.  Yu and his team visited many countries in recent years to get to know foreign musicians better. They also found that many were interested in Chinese music.  ""We believe this event will promote such connections,"" Yu says.  The symphony and folk orchestras of the Central Conservatory of Music will present the opening concert at the event on May 5. Other recitals include a joint performance by musicians from Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, Turkey and Iran, and a concert marking 25 years of diplomatic relations between China and Azerbaijan.  The conservatory, a leading music school in China, was founded in 1950. It started research on musical connections among countries along the Silk Road in 2014.  Last year, it set up the Center for Music Communication, Development and Research.  The music conference will be held ahead of the first Belt and Road Forum in Beijing over May 14-15."

0,"A film festival about the great outdoors is getting the attention of young sports fans, Zhang Xingjian reports. When Qian Haiying first introduced Canada's Banff Mountain Film Festival to China in 2010, it was initially out of her interest in outdoor sports. She and her team－mainly three members－were seeking funding and a chance to develop their fan base. Ultimately, Qian quit her job as a marketing executive in IBM and devoted herself to the founding of Banff China, a film festival that aims to promote outdoor and nature documentaries in the country. Banff China has grown rapidly over the past seven years. This year's festival will launch its tour in Beijing on June 24 and then go to Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Chengdu. The festival not only promotes mountain culture, but also covers diving, running and skiing. The festival that runs through September has hosted a series of seminars, lectures and training programs since May. All activities aim to give people more understanding of the fun of outdoor sports and related lifestyle, Qian says. ""When I was fresh in outdoor sports, China had not taken up that craze, and I often learned about outdoor sport ideas and skills from foreign countries,"" the 43-year-old recalls.,  Regarded as the ""Oscars of outdoor sports"", the Banff Mountain Film Festival was launched by two renowned climbers, John Amati and Chic Scott, in the Canadian town of Banff in 1975. As an international film competition and an annual presentation of short films and documentaries about mountain culture, sports and environment, it has become a popular gathering of outdoors enthusiasts, including sports fans, adventurers, photographers, filmmakers and environmentalists from around the world. As an enthusiast of marathons, diving, skiing and skydiving, Qian first attended the Banff Mountain Film Festival in Canada in 2009. There was no such kind of event in her homeland, and Qian came up with the idea to bring the festival to China. Qian says the festival is growing as enthusiasm for outdoor sports grows. A light show titled LightAnimal has been incorporated this year, showcasing the possibilities of education about animals in a spectacular way. LightAnimal is a digital exhibition providing virtual encounters with any animal species. Its moving images can be shown in any kind of venue, small or large, and it is interactive. ""LightAnimal can show and explain the animals' behavior in a way that would be impossible to see in a captive environment. LightAnimal creatures are also interactive, which means that they can perceive and react to members of the audience who stand in front of the screen,"" says Haruyoshi Kawai, director and animator of the LightAnimal project team.,  ""Above all, it has no impact on animals in the wild because it is virtual. People can enjoy watching the virtual creations, and simply look and learn,"" Qian says. ""This year, we have brought LightAnimal to Beijing, hoping more people, children in particular, can discover the mystery of the ocean,"" she adds. Two months ago, Qian saw an online news story about a sperm whale stranded at a port in Shenzhen, South China's Guangdong province. The whale later died. She was sad about the whale and determined to do something for marine creatures. In this year's film festival, she proposed an environmental initiative, ""Say No to Plastic"". ""Each time I have gone diving with my teammates, I have witnessed the terrible impact of plastic on the whole ocean and living creatures,"" Qian explains. ""The plastic can be broken into extremely tiny parts. Some of them will go into the bodies of maritime creatures while others, mixed with sea salt, will be consumed by us humans again."",  ""The environmental problems are not far away from us. Instead, they are so close to our modern life that we barely notice them,"" Qian says. Meanwhile, a training program to encourage more talent to go into outdoor sports documentary shooting will be launched at this year's film festival. ""We have done a survey that shows our main audience is between 25 to 45 years old. Passionate and energetic, college students are the main force of the targeted group. And we hope the training program will let more young people know about us,"" Qian says. Before entering the universities, many college students are under huge academic pressure, which leaves them little time to think about their lives. ""But everything changes after living in an ivory tower, and they gradually get to know society. Faced with many choices, they can decide themselves who they really want to be,"" she says. ""Developing the hobby of outdoor sports is a pretty good choice. They can make new friends, develop a healthy lifestyle and get closer to nature."" The training program will start at Beijing's Peking University and be promoted at other universities in the future. Related:"
1,"URUMQI -- Nineteen provincial-level regions offered a total of 15.18 billion yuan ($2.37 billion) in aid to northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region last year, supporting anti-poverty work and improving employment rate in the region. The 19 provinces or major cities, including the prosperous Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Guangdong Province, provided both financial and technological support to Xinjiang. ""They have introduced textile, electronic and agricultural processing enterprises to the region last year, which have helped promote employment among ethnic people, maintained stability in the region and increased communication between local residents and inland cities,"" said Shohrat Zakir, chairman of the Xinjiang regional government, when he delivered a government work report at the ongoing local parliamentary session. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in 2012, the 19 provinces and cities have invested 72.4 billion yuan to the region and offered more than 500,000 job opportunities to local residents, according to statistics. The central government decided at the first central work meeting on Xinjiang in 2010 to set up a mechanism under which 19 provinces and major cities, including the prosperous Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Guangdong Province, provide financial and technological support to Xinjiang."

Yang Huiyan,vice-chairwoman of Country Garden Holdings, became the richest Chinese woman with 160 billion yuan, followed by Lens Technology's Zhou Qunfei and Longfor Properties' Wu Yajun with 70 billion yuan and 52.5 billion yuan respectively, revealed by the Hurun report titled Richest Women in China 2017. Industries such as real estate and financial investments are the major sources of wealth for female entrepreneurs on the list, accounting for 24 percent and 20 percent respectively. However, the most successful self-made female entrepreneur comes from the manufacturing industry. Shenzhen overtook Beijing to become the most preferred city of residence for the female entrepreneurs on this year's list, and Shanghai grabbed the third spot. This has been the 12th consecutive year for the Hurun Research Institute to release such kind of report since 2006.

0,"The government will promote more balanced development in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei cluster, with particular focus on improving transportation, environmental protection and industrial upgrades this year, according to the nation's top economic regulator. The government will also build a project database and help facilitate the deployment of key projects this year in the region, according to an official document. Such efforts come as the central government intends to ease the mega-city syndrome of the capital, ease congestion and integrate regional economies for more balanced development. By the end of 2020, around 1,000 manufacturing industries and 300 logistics centers in Beijing will be either shut down or relocated to nearby places, as part of efforts to relocate Beijing's non-capital functions, according to Liu Bozheng, deputy head of Beijing coordinated development office. A number of wholesale markets and educational and medical organizations will be moved to surrounding regions in an orderly manner, he said during a press conference held in January. Xu Datong, Party chief of Tianjin Economic and Technology Development Area, said a hefty investment of 66.4 billion yuan ($10.53 billion) was injected to a modern service district devoted to industrial convergence among Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei last year, involving 393 projects. The area has launched strategies to lure more headquarters of multinational and research institutes to tackle the challenges. Some efforts to promote more balanced development have started to bear fruit, data showed. In the first three quarters in 2017, the service sector accounted for 82 percent of Beijing's total GDP during the period, during which finance, information and technology industries together accounted for more than 50 percent of the GDP. Hebei province, which used to rely greatly on heavy industries has appeared to gather pace in restructuring, as 58.6 million metric tons of iron and 56.3 million tons of steel production capacity have been reduced since 2014. Amid the rebalancing process, some valuable non-capital functions are expected to move to Xiongan New Area, which is expected to promote regional development together with Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei cluster, according to the National Development and Reform Commission. Located some 100 kilometers from Beijing, the new area is designed to become part of key urban development plans integrating the capital with surrounding areas. The government is expected to introduce a slew of supportive measures in finance, tax, technology and opening-up policies ""as required"", according to an official with the NDRC. During the early stage of development, the government will put particular focus on infrastructural construction and improve transportation connecting the region, say, the high speed railway network, the official said. While the overall construction plan has yet to be released to the public, some efforts in improving transportation have been already in place. The intercity railway connecting Beijing and Xiongan area is expected to start construction in March, according to a report by China Railway Design Corp. Upon completion of the railways, travel time from Xiongan to Beijing will be reduced to 30 minutes, down by 60 percent compared to the current time. Looking ahead, top authorities might need to balance well the different roles of Xiongan and surrounding regions, and the value chains and ecosystems need to be studied before making policies, according to Zhou Muzhi, an economics professor at Tokyo Keizai University. He said research institutions that rely heavily on government financial support and yet with no strict geographical limitations, for instance, might be appropriate to move to Xiongan."
0,"More than a dozen experts gathered in Beijing for a recent forum about the integration of culture and tourism in the digital era. The forum was part of the 2018 China Internet Culture Conference, which was co-held by China Animation Comic Game Group and Beijing Municipal Culture and Tourism Bureau. “Museums have become an important destination for tourists, who believe it’s stylish to visit a museum,” Luo Jing, director of museums at the State Administration of Cultural Heritage, said in his speech. According to him, when China started its reform and opening up policy in 1978, the country only had 349 museums, and the number has since jumped to more than 5,000 today, hosting more than 20,000 exhibitions every year. He said smart tourism makes it convenient for tourists to make an appointment or listen to an audio guide on their smartphones. Some immersive experiences in museums allow them to learn about knowledge via high technology such as 3D projections. According to him, the purpose of cultural tourism is to popularize knowledge and culture. It’s important to develop good quality and customized tourism products to cater to different demands of tourists. “It’s the local culture that attracts tourists to a destination. What we should do is to promote such culture in a proper way to a wider audience,” said Cai Jinghui, co-founder and president of Chinese travel information website, Qyer. He said Qyer has developed city walks with cultural themes in cites at home and abroad which enable small groups of tourists to travel like a local, exploring the city with the guidance of a local resident with abundant knowledge. In Beijing, for instance, travelers can choose to stroll along Shijia hutong or Yangmeizhu Xiejie, to have an adventurous journey."
1,"This year people will be able to use one card for public transportation in 260 cities at prefecture level and above, including Beijing, Wu Chungeng, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, said on Tuesday, China News Service has reported. The transport card has been introduced in 245 cities so far and will come into operation in a further 15 by the end of the year, the report said. Only transport cards with China T-union's sign can be used in different cities. Passengers with local transport cards can change to China T-union cards by local policy. As the city of Beijing is upgrading and debugging its China T-union card system, its bus system temporarily only supports transport cards of 50 cities, while its urban rail transit system only supports 188 cities' transport cards, according to the report. To increase convenience and improve the quality of service, the Ministry of Transport last year introduced a regulation on service-quality management on the China T-union card system. This aimed to solve the problems of using China T-union cards in different cities, insufficient branches for card recharges and returns, and poor service. The integration of the transport card in urban and rural areas in China is expected to be realized by 2020, the report said. Achieving the integration of the transport card in 260 cities is one of the 12 practical works close to people's lives that the Ministry of Transport plans to carry out this year, according to the report."
1,"Mianyang in Sichuan province has witnessed unprecedented development in science and technology since China adopted the reform and opening-up policy in the late 1970s. Despite being far from any coast or border, the city has played a part in a variety of technological achievements, such as the first domestically developed large passenger plane, the C919. The C919 made its maiden flight in Shanghai on May 5 last year. After 79 minutes in the air, the twin-engine plane landed safely at Shanghai Pudong International Airport at 3:20 pm, signaling the nation's entry into the global aviation market. In 2007, the central government approved plans to develop a Chinese-built large passenger jet. Eight years later, the first C919 jet rolled off the assembly line. The ""C"" in the name stands for China, while the number nine symbolizes ""forever"" in Chinese and 19 represents the fact the plane can seat up to 190 passengers. With a standard range of 4,075 kilometers and maximum range of 5,555 km, the narrow-body jet is comparable with the updated Airbus 320 and Boeing's new-generation 737, according to aviation experts. Brian Foley, president of an aviation consultancy in the United States, said the C919 could compete with the Boeing and Airbus duopoly, particularly if it became the preferred airliner of Chinese carriers. The C919 has been hailed as a notable achievement in the development of China's civil aviation industry. Many parts of the aircraft were made in Sichuan, including its nose, avionics system, in-cabin entertainment system, interior lighting and radio, according to the provincial government. Sichuan Jiuzhou Electric Group in Mianyang made the C919 cabin's core system, including a public announcement system and cabin intercom, according to Li Yixun, one of its researchers. The company also produced the cabin's lighting system, which features the so-called LED wall washer that creates the illusion of light rippling gently against the wall's surface, Li said. Due to its technological advantage, in 2001, the central government approved Mianyang's plan to build the China Science and Technology City, which aims to convert the city's research resources into commercial products. The government said it planned to make Mingyang a role model for civil-military integration, a hub for technological innovation, a center for technology exchanges, a base for innovative professionals and a destination for high-tech businesses. As a result, the city was able to benefit from the same preferential policies enjoyed by Beijing's Zhongguancun Science Park, one of the nation's innovation hubs."
0,"Authorities said ""excessive restoration"" of the Great Wall will be avoided in the future to help preserve its historical integrity. Song Xinchao, deputy director of the National Cultural Heritage Administration, was replying to a question from China Daily at a news conference in Beijing on Thursday. Thirteen years in the making, the national-level Great Wall comprehensive conservation plan was released by the administration and the Ministry of Culture and Tourism on Tuesday. It will be used to guide restoration, management of public access and academic research until 2035. ""Many people have biased understandings,"" Song said. ""They confuse restoration of the wall with development of a tourist attraction."" He said that restorations of the main structures are often not differentiated from general construction work. ""Many restorers have stereotyped ideas that every section of the Great Wall should be like Badaling in Beijing,"" he said. ""That leads to many problems."" In 2015, restoration of a section of the Great Wall in Suizhong county, Liaoning province, aroused widespread anger online after portions were paved over with cement, destroying its original facade. A collapsed gate along the Great Wall in Shanyin county, Shanxi province, was worked on in 2017, but it was widely criticized for its unattractive appearance. In the new plan, the principle of minimum intervention is emphasized. ""For those portions that have become ruins, the priority is to avoid or slow down their disappearance. Massive restoration is not suitable in such cases,"" the document said. The cultural heritage administration organized a nationwide survey of the Great Wall from 2006 to 2010, and a digital database of the structure was created in 2015. The comprehensive conservation plan was approved by the State Council earlier this month. According to the survey, more than 21,000 kilometers of the Great Wall survive in 15 provincial-level administrative regions across China. This includes 8,800 km built during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), with the most familiar sections to tourists constructed with bricks. However, in earlier dynasties, earth and stone were major building materials. In some western provinces, portions were even constructed by mixing sand and vegetation. ""We will enhance the expertise among restorers, though no uniform standards for fixing the Great Wall should be set. However, more scientific guidance is needed to encourage each section to use standards based on its own characteristics and materials,"" Song said. Liu Yuzhu, director of the administration, said the Great Wall is not only an architectural wonder but also a landmark that promotes national pride. For example, Chinese soldiers fought Japanese forces in 1933 along the Great Wall near Beijing. ""The Great Wall is deeply rooted in Chinese people's hearts as a form of spiritual strength,"" Liu said. ""In the new conservation plan, nongovernmental efforts are encouraged to organize more protection for the structure and promote educational programs."" Liu said that about 100 million yuan ($14.7 million) has been allocated annually to protect the Great Wall in recent years, and most funds have been spent on key sections. But many local patrols overseeing the structure still lack sufficient financial support. ""Now that the conservation plan has been released, local governments can put more emphasis on the work,"" Liu said. Beijing has set an example by including payment for patrols made up of local residents. There are more than 3,000 such patrols registered nationwide. The Great Wall was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987, one of the earliest in China to achieve the honor. The China Foundation for Cultural Heritage Conservation joined hands with US technology giant Intel in 2018 to use artificial intelligence and aerial drones to monitor sections of the Great Wall near Beijing and help facilitate future restoration work. Research institutes from China and the United Kingdom have also been holding regular symposiums since 2017 to improve protection of the Great Wall, as well as Hadrian's Wall, which was built by the Romans in northern England."
0,"Beijing shut down 13 expressways on Wednesday due to heavy fog in Beijing and surrounding regions, according to transportation authorities. At 1 pm, the air quality index in Beijing was 301, a level-six air pollution. Air pollution is worsening in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei province region and nearby areas and is expected to linger until Friday due to unfavorable meteorological conditions for dispersal, authorities said. Anyang, Henan province - listed as one of the 28 major cities in the region for coordinated action on air pollution control - was the first to see its hourly density of PM 2.5, a major air pollutant, reach heavy pollution level early on Monday. The heavy pollution has gradually been extending to the north, the China National Environmental Monitoring Center said in a statement on Tuesday. Pollutants started to accumulate on Monday in the region and in the Fenhe and Weihe river plains, primarily in Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces, as meteorological conditions turned unfavorable.,PM2.5 density hit a peak of 206 micrograms per cubic meter at 7 pm on Monday in Kaifeng, Henan province, it said. Chai Fahe, deputy director of the National Joint Research Center on Air Pollution Causes and Control, said weak wind from the south and high humidity in the region are to blame for the heavy smog. A stable atmosphere and a temperature inversion, which prevents the normal churn of the atmosphere, has occurred in many cities in the region. He added that the northern parts of the country have entered the period of highest emission, as heating services officially begin on Thursday. ""Currently, emissions from industries and transportation sources in the region remain high. Kicked-up dust has yet to be well-controlled at various large construction sites,"" Chai said, adding that the start of the heating season will further increase emissions.,Starting on Thursday at noon, cold fronts will gradually clear the haze from north to south, ending this bout with smog on Friday in most areas in the region, the monitoring center said. Thanks to the cold air, most parts of the region will experience good air quality, although some may be stricken by mild pollution from Friday to Sunday, it said. Beijing will see heavy air pollution on Wednesday and Thursday morning and mild air pollution on Thursday afternoon, the center said. The capital's air pollution emergency response office issued a yellow alert for smog on Tuesday, reminding residents to take precautions. Under Beijing's three-tier warning system, the yellow alert is the least severe, followed by orange and red.,The yellow alert and above will trigger a series of compulsory emergency responses that can include the suspension of outdoor construction operations to reduce dust, the restriction of heavily polluting vehicles and the suspension of production at smokestack industries. The Ministry of Ecology and Environment has sent a notice to the governments of Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, Henan and Shaanxi provinces, as well as to Beijing and Tianjin, urging them to take emergency response measures, including production restrictions, to help curb the pollution. As of 8 am on Monday, 25 cities had taken steps as required, according to the ministry."
1,"BEIJING - China on Thursday reiterated its opposition to the US Section 301 investigation and urged the United States to cease investigation procedures. Gao Feng, spokesperson for the Ministry of Commerce, made the remarks at a press conference when commenting on the public hearings in the United States on the tariff proposal based on the Section 301 investigation against China from May 15 to 17. In April, the US administration proposed tariffs on a list of Chinese goods worth $50 billion based on the Section 301 investigation into alleged Chinese intellectual property and technology transfer practices. The Section 301 investigation is ""an act of unilateralism"" and ""unpopular with the public,"" he said, citing that more than 90 percent of the 2,000-plus published comments during the hearings opposed the tariff proposal. Gao also denied links between the public hearing and the ongoing China-US economic and trade consultations in Washington. ""We urge the United States to cease the Section 301 investigation to create a good environment for bilateral economic and trade cooperation,"" he said."

1,"Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao heads talked about their expectations for development of the area at the China Development Forum 2019 in Beijing on Monday. The forum marked their first joint appearance after the release of the outline development plan for Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area in February, ""The global economy is currently full of uncertainties and instability. The opening and interconnection of nine inland cities and Hong Kong and Macao Special Administrative Regions under the background of ""one country, two systems"", three tariff zones and three sets of legal systems fully demonstrate that economies with different characteristics can cooperate together to achieve win-win situations,"" said Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, according to a Shanghai Securities News report. ""I think the Greater Bay Area not only has the potential to become the oriental Silicon Valley, but also has the ability to become a distinctive urban agglomeration like Silicon Valley and Wall Street,"" she said. At the frontier of reform and opening-up, the cities of Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Zhuhai will embark on a broader international stage through the Greater Bay Area, said Ma Xingrui, Guangdong province governor. He said that promoting the construction of the Greater Bay Area can highlight Guangdong's geographic advantage, adjacent to Hong Kong and Macao, and will help the city accelerate high-quality development, fully dock the international high-standard market rules system, and speed up the construction of a new open economic system. Speaking about Hong Kong's position in the Greater Bay Area, Lam said although technological innovation and research and development accounted for only 0.7 percent and 0.8 percent of Hong Kong's GDP in 2017, Hong Kong has the potential to contribute to and benefit from developing the Greater Bay Area into an international science and technology innovation center. As the outline development plan for the Greater Bay Area has set goals for developing distinctive financial industries and promoting the interconnection of financial markets, Lam said Hong Kong will play a leading role in these fields. Macao Chief Executive Fernando Chui Sai-on said the Greater Bay Area has given Macao a new mission, prompting it to play an active role as an engine and become a supporter of the construction of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Macao science and technology innovation corridor. Ma said Guangdong will continue to promote the a legal, international and convenient business environment, and accelerate the improvement of the internal transport network in Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Hong Kong and Guangzhou, Zhuhai and Macao, and strive to promote one-hour access between major cities. Government will implement the Foreign Investment Law, and strengthen the rules of Hong Kong and Macao in the fields of legal services, finance, medical treatment and construction, said Ma. It will further improve institutional arrangements of property rights protection, government services and legal protection, and accelerate the creation of a stable, fair, transparent and predictable first-class business environment, said Ma. To seize new opportunities brought about by the Greater Bay Area, Hong Kong has been making efforts to attract both talent and innovative science and technology companies, said Lam. ""We have introduced tax subsidies to ensure that talent from Hong Kong and Macao, especially technicians, joins the construction of the Greater Bay Area. "" ""At the same time, we have launched a series of policies to attract mainland and overseas returnees to work in Hong Kong,"" she said. Although limited space and human resources have restricted Macao's development, Chui said with central government support the region has gained development space through urban renewal, land reclamation and marine resources. ""With the opportunity of the Greater Bay Area, Macao will actively go out and deepen regional cooperation,"" Chui said. Ma said that Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao will hold a promotional event in Tokyo on April 9."
0,"People with poor social credit records - including bad behavior or refusing to pay debts - will be barred from booking rooms at star-rated hotels or taking part in high-cost group tours in Beijing, the municipal tourism authority said. The Beijing Municipal Commission of Tourism Development launched a website called ""Credit Beijing"" on Tuesday, which collects the credit records of tourists and people working in the industry in Beijing. The platform covers 44,690 tour guides, 2,672 travel agencies, 281 attractions and 559 star-rated hotels in Beijing, according to a news release posted on the commission's social media account. Users can check the records of tour guides and travel agencies in the city, a move that aims to help consumers avoid unscrupulous behavior by a particular guide or travel agency. Tourists exhibiting uncivilized behavior, such as scribbling graffiti or making noise at tourist attractions, will also be recorded on the platform. Those with poor credit records - as well as people blacklisted in other sectors, including defaulters who fail to pay court judgments and violators of air and rail transport rules - ""will all be banned from staying in star-rated hotels in Beijing or joining high-cost group tours"", an unnamed official was quoted saying in the news release. ""The commission has signed memorandums of understanding with the civil affairs, transportation, customs and tax administration departments of the city ... to ensure the implementation of punishment for the dishonest,"" the official said. ""It will help better regulate the tourism market and protect tourists' rights, which will also help support a good commercial environment in Beijing."" The measure is one of the latest moves in an ongoing campaign to improve behavior, toughen sanctions on wrongdoers and enhance integrity and credibility. Previously, people on the government's blacklist for dishonesty have been banned from all air and railway travel."
1,"Healthcare continued to be a sweet spot for investment in China, with funds to the tune of 82.6 billion yuan ($12.28 billion) flowing into the sector, up 78.64 percent on an annualized basis, in 2018. Though much of the investments was fueled by the surging healthcare demands of the country's aging population, it was also aided by people's growing healthcare demand and policy support, said a recent industry report. The report, published by medical research consultancy vcbeat.net, showed that fundraising in the country's medical sector has grown rapidly from the 6.72 percent seen in 2017 to the current level. The pharmaceutical sector continued to be the mainstay of the investments and garnered 21.3 billion yuan of funds. The growth and number of deals in the sector were also significant at 210 percent and 245 percent respectively on a yearly basis. The biotechnology sector attracted investment of 11.1 billion yuan and was ranked second. ""The growth in pharmaceutical sector investments was probably due to the government's policy adjustments. The drug assessment reform and the pilot drug procurement program created new growth engines for the industry and raised investor confidence in the sector. However, as the industry settles down, it may not be able to replicate the momentum seen in 2018. This year, there may be a slight decline in pharmaceutical sector investments,"" the report said. Chen Qiaoshan, a medical analyst at Beijing-based market research consultancy Analysys, said sustained demand helped fuel investments last year. ""Demand for medicines has been growing steadily and increased investments would benefit patients in the form of more, better drugs to combat serious diseases."" Aside of the direct investments, the sector also saw a flurry of merger and acquisition deals. A total of 695 deals were completed last year, up 52.75 percent from the previous year. That number was close to the earlier record of 703 deals achieved in 2014. The medical device sector saw 141 transactions and was the leader in the number of deals. Investment in the medical device sector surged as the government stepped up efforts to encourage scientific innovation. Minimally invasive companies, intelligent diagnosis companies, as well as medical imaging companies were the major beneficiaries,"" said Chen. ""From an investor's perspective, scientific breakthroughs led to new technologies, which in turn opened doors to the huge market in China,"" she said. Most of the investment in 2018 was mainly in four sectors - medical devices, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals and medical digitization, accounting for 61.15 percent of the total deals, Chen said. Shang Yang, a medical analyst at Beijing-based think tank EO Intelligence, said that ""the investment surge has boosted investor confidence. The healthcare sector, as a non-periodic sector, will see investments grow on a yearly basis, with specific sectors expected to garner more financing support."" On a regional basis, most of the investments were mainly in Beijing and eastern coastal regions, with Shanghai, Beijing and Guangdong the top three in terms of the amount and number of deals. The number of deals in the three regions stood at 448, or 64.46 percent of the total. At the same time, Sichuan province became the center of medical services in western China, with 28 investments and 27 deals in Chengdu. According to Chen, investment growth in the healthcare sector will continue to pick up, considering that demand is growing and the industry is becoming more policy-oriented. Pharmaceuticals, wearables, rehabilitation equipment and medical finance will be the popular sectors for investment this year."

1,"BEIJING - China will implement a 3-year action plan to improve its transport network and services, according to the Ministry of Transport. The plan reaffirmed China's goals in building a fully-fledged transport network by 2020 when it will reach the goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all aspects. By 2020, China will have 30,000 kilometers of high-speed railway, covering 80 percent of Chinese cities with a population of over 1 million, according to the plan which lists 76 targets. The country also aims to add some 180 new deep-water berths at its seaports for 10,000-tonne vessels and above. Integration of transport within the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area will be accelerated, according to the plan, as driving time between the cities of Beijing, Tianjin, Baoding and Tangshan will be reduced to within one hour. Travel time from the urban centers of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei's capital city Shijiazhuang to their suburban new towns and satellite cities will be also reduced to within one hour. Similar commuting convenience will be ensured between Beijing and neighboring Zhangjiakou, co-hosts of the 2022 Winter Olympic Games. Efforts will be made to allow passengers to use one ticket for different transport services including flight, high-speed railway and urban rail transit, according to the plan."
1,"China and the United States have reached a number of trade agreements and agreed to set up a work mechanism to continue communicating with each other and to sort out unsolved problems and disputes, after high-level trade talks in Beijing this week. Senior commerce officials from both sides fully exchanged views and reached consensus on a number of issues, including the expansion of US exports to China, bilateral trade in services, two-way investment, the protection of intellectual property rights and the resolution of tariff and nontariff measures, Xinhua News Agency reported on Friday. However, officials from both countries recognized that major differences still exist and they must step up efforts and make more progress. They agreed to maintain close contact with each other on relevant issues and set up a corresponding work mechanism, according to Xinhua. Adequately settling trade and economic disputes through negotiations on an equal footing and maintaining the overall stability of trade relations are in line with the common interests of both countries and the world as a whole, said Mei Xinyu, a senior researcher of the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation of the Ministry of Commerce. Tu Xinquan, director of the China Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, said that as the world's two biggest economies, the US and China are intensely interdependent and intertwined, and it is inevitable that any protective trade measures that are put into place will hurt the global value chain. Taking into account the size of the Chinese and US economies and the complexity of their relationship, it is unrealistic to resolve all of the thorny issues through talks lasting two days, Tu added. The two sides should make full use of work mechanisms and channels for dialogue in the future to resolve remaining disputes, under the principles of being fair, sincere, rational and pragmatic, said Wei Jianguo, former vice-minister of commerce. The sides are expected to reach common ground and seek the maximum common interest, Wei added. Long Guoqiang, vice-president of the Development Research Center of the State Council, said, ""In addition to talks and communications between governments, the role of companies and think tanks in easing trade tensions should be further highlighted."" According to Long, US companies can do more to serve as stabilizers of the bilateral trade and economic relationship, and Chinese companies in the US should also be encouraged to voice their concerns and legitimate rights. The Ministry of Commerce said on Friday that US officials agreed at the trade talks to raise China's objections to sanctions against Chinese telecom gear maker ZTE with US President Donald Trump. A ministry spokesman said China lodged its complaints during the meetings and the US side took the complaints seriously and agreed to report them to Trump. S&P Global, a rating agency, warned recently that US-listed manufacturing, energy and financial groups have seen a heavier impact from the tariffs than Chinese companies. A US delegation led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Trump's special envoy, exchanged views with their Chinese counterparts in Beijing on Thursday and Friday. After ""efficient, honest and constructive"" talks, both sides believed that a healthy and stable Sino-US economic and trade relationship carries great importance and they are committed to resolving problems and disputes through dialogue and consultation, Xinhua reported."
0,"BEIJING - The process of laying tracks for an intercity railway linking Beijing with Xiongan New Area is now applying the BeiDou navigation system, according to the Science and Technology Daily on Tuesday. Track laying machines were installed with cameras to transmit operation videos along the tracks. An intelligent control platform was established for transportation and scheduling of laying tracks to monitor machines running in real time and manage construction safety systematically. The intercity railway line, set to be operational by 2020, will be an important link between the urban areas of Beijing, the Beijing new airport and Xiongan New Area. The railway starts with Liying Station in Daxing District and passes through Gu'an and Bazhou before reaching Xiongan station in the southwest. The Beijing section of the railway line is expected to become operational in September this year along with the Beijing Daxing International Airport, or the Beijing new airport. Workers are laying down 69 km of track from Liying station to the new airport, and the work needs to be completed in 15 days. The designed highest speed of the intercity rail link ranges from 250 km to 350 km per hour, said the newspaper. It will cut the commuting time between urban areas of Beijing and Xiongan from two hours to 30 minutes. China's BeiDou navigation system began providing global services in December 2018. The positioning accuracy of the system has reached 10 meters globally and five meters in the Asia-Pacific region. Its velocity accuracy is 0.2 meters per second, while its timing accuracy stands at 20 nanoseconds."

The two sessions - one of the biggest political events of the year in the country - usually attract thousands of reporters from domestic and overseas media as they offer a good chance for media to get a glimpse into China's overall development. The Second Session of the 13th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference will open on Sunday in Beijing, and the Second Session of the 13th National People's Congress will kick off on Tuesday. National lawmakers and political advisers, about 5,000 in total, will review the annual work reports of the central government, the top court and top procuratorate, the country's social and economic development plan and the budget. This year, the NPC will also review a draft foreign investment law. During the sessions, the media center - located at Beijing's Media Center Hotel in Haidian district - will hold a series of news conferences on topics of major public concern. Senior officials in charge of different sectors will come to meet the media. On Wednesday afternoon, more than 20 free public computers were available for use on the first floor of the media center, and free Wi-Fi was also provided. ""A 5G network will be provided for journalists for the first time during the sessions,"" said a China Unicom technician responsible for the network service at the center. ""We hope a faster and safer online environment will better help journalists,"" he added. Also on Wednesday, the 5G signal started to cover Tian'anmen Square in downtown Beijing. China Unicom took the lead in realizing full coverage of the square's 5G signal, and the 5G stations can provide high-definition news coverage of the two sessions, according to Beijing Youth Daily.

1,"Flower grower Wei Caiyu, 47, leans over in a field of jasmine and quickly picks some fragrant flower buds. She is anxious to get on her motorcycle to sell the fresh jasmine in the market before it rains. It's 9:30 am in mid-October and she is heading out for the fourth time - and the price differs each time. ""My waist aches after bending down for a long time, and the sun is hot most of the time. It's tiring work, but the effort is worthwhile because of its profitability,"" said Wei, from Hengxian county in Nanning, Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region. Her family owns 0.13 hectares of jasmine bushes that were planted nearly three decades ago. The annual income is about 30,000 yuan ($4,300) from a good harvest, which is about 10 times that of growing grains on the same amount of land. The jasmine flowering season runs from May to October. Like other local growers, Wei picks flower buds from dawn to dusk during the peak season - from May to August - and does odd jobs in the offseason. Hengxian started to plant jasmine on a large scale in 1978, when China launched its reform and opening-up policy. In 2017, the county had 7,000 hectares of jasmine and about 330,000 growers. It produced a total of 85,000 metric tons of jasmine last year. The county also boasts more than 130 jasmine tea companies, including Beijing brand Zhang Yi Yuan. ""Our jasmine tea industry is mature. The current focus of work is to acquire more added value from jasmine and extend our industrial chain,"" county head Zeng Pengxin said. ""Jasmine is of great value in skin care and health maintenance, and it's also a medicinal plant. It's an untapped market and we're looking for institutions to do related research."" He believes it's important for government to build Hengxian's jasmine as a brand through good policies. He also noticed that in recent years local jasmine-related products have become more diverse, ranging from skin-care products and snacks to bonsai. Huang Shanzhen, general manager of Guangxi Shunlai Tea Co, which owns Zhou Shun Lai, a local jasmine tea brand that dates back to 1886, said it's important to keep pace with the era, so she's working hard to develop new products based on jasmine. ""I like the tea business because it makes people healthy. Also, you can do various things related to jasmine,"" she said. Huang is planning to launch a milk tea shop next spring in Nanning, selling milk tea made with jasmine. ""Besides our signature jasmine tea, we have to offer new products to target young Chinese. The milk tea market has great potential in China. Drinking it has become a part of the social life of young people, including my 18-year-old daughter,"" she said. The company started selling skin-care and fragrance products made with jasmine flowers last year. Its jasmine essence oil is popular. Huang said there was only jasmine green tea in the past, and now there are other types in the market, such as jasmine black tea and jasmine pu'er tea. ""It's an old brand, but our packages should showcase youthful vigor to attract young customers,"" she said. Bi Donghai, 29, is one of the pioneering sellers of jasmine bonsai, an uncommon species in the market. He started his business in 2017 and sold plants at an average price of 350 yuan. His customers are mainly middle-aged and elderly. Bi, now the Party secretary of Hengxian county's Dong'an village, said flower growers often dig up the jasmine stalks that were planted three decades ago because of their poor nutrition and yield. He seeks out and buys these wide stalks from growers and spends at least half a year carefully reviving them. When the jasmine stalks are prosperous and blooming again, he will cut them into beautiful shapes and sell them to customers. He and his team spent a lot of money in 2016 to figure out a way to make the jasmine bonsai. ""It's of artistic value. I'm confident about its potential market,"" Bi said. On the other hand, Bi said young people prefer smaller, cheaper, potted jasmine, rather than bonsai, to which value is often added by the artistic factor. They're satisfied that they'll be able to enjoy the fragrance at a cost of about 20 yuan. His potted jasmine is sold mostly to Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Zhengzhou. ""In the early years, the locals would sell jasmine seedlings to people from other places. Customers had no idea that the fragrant jasmine originated from our county,"" he said. In 2015, residents started to sell potted jasmine. Bi is working hard to ensure the quality of his potted jasmine and to import other species from overseas. ""Many flower growers still plant jasmine in a traditional way. But I'm adopting modern technology such as soilless cultivation, and quality criteria for potted jasmine,"" Bi said. His company also helped provide jobs to local villagers. Like local traders and companies, his market relies mainly on e-commerce. In 2015, Hengxian became Guangxi's first model county in Alibaba's Rural Taobao Program. ""While the program focuses on turning rural residents into online shoppers, the government is also working hard to encourage local traders and companies to sell farm products on e-commerce sites by providing subsidies,"" county head Zeng said. In past years, the county has established a logistics system with delivery costs much lower than before. It has a network of rural e-commerce service centers covering more than 80 percent of all administrative villages. ""The development of e-commerce not only greatly increases companies' sales but also boosts poverty relief work. For example, the supply of passion fruit in a village falls short of demand online, while in the past nobody wanted to buy any, even at half price,"" he said. He said migrant workers are lured to the county because they can earn a decent salary in their hometown without much pressure."

The Peking opera films are all adapted from well-known folk stories including     . ""The 10 films all represent the fine qualities and traditions of Chinese people and it is a smart way to integrate traditional opera with modern film technology,"" movie-goer Chen Yulian, 65, said at the premiere of   on April 20. Since July 2011, artists and experts from the opera and film industries have come together to promote the ""Peking Opera Film"" project. By embracing the idea of promoting positive energy and telling good stories, ""Peking Opera Film"" has been listed as one of the key national cultural projects of 2017. ""What makes the Peking opera film? It is not a mixture, but an integration. It is expected to reinterpret the old opera with the help of modern film technology,"" says Ye Saholan, renowned Chinese Peking opera artist. ""As the internet engulfs young people, many of them have no idea about what Chinese opera is. In their mind, it is a historic yet boring art form,"" a senior man worried. ""Through the project, we hope more and more people can come to the cinema and really take a look at Peking opera. By including a high-tech, modern touch, audience members can appreciate the beauty of Beijing opera while enjoying the story from their own perspective,"" Ye says. To maximize publicity, many social communities in Bejing's Chaoyang district have set regular theaters and dates for citizens to watch these films throughout the year, broadcasting over 500 times in 2017."
1,"The State Council, or China's Cabinet, appointed Xiao Yaqing, the nation's former top State assets regulator, as the minister of the State Administration of Market Regulation, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security announced on Tuesday. The reshuffle of senior officials came after Zhang Mao, the former head of the State Administration of Market Regulation, reached the mandatory retirement age of 65. Hao Peng, current Party secretary of the State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, will take full charge of the SASAC. Xiao was general manager of State-owned Aluminum Corporation of China Ltd before becoming deputy secretary-general of the State Council in 2009. He was appointed chairman of the SASAC in 2016, tasked with deepening reform of the nation's SOEs. Under Xiao's leadership, the SASAC has been advancing a mixed-ownership reform pilot program to let private businesses better engage in SOE reform by having more access to the sector, said Li Jin, chief researcher at the China Enterprise Research Institute in Beijing. The commission also took a number of measures to adjust the asset structure of SOEs, such as the merger of China Guodian Corp and Shenhua Group, as well as China Grain Reserves Group Ltd and China National Cotton Reserves Corp. It also took steps to reform the State-owned capital authorization management system and tighten supervision of SOEs' investment in overseas markets. Born in 1959 in Beijing, Xiao will be the second person to head the State Administration of Market Regulation since it was established in March 2018. The SASAC oversees areas including company registration, intellectual property protection, antitrust reviews, market competition, product quality, and food safety and drug approvals. At the administration, Xiao's main task will be promoting market-based economic activity as this is the key to overall and steady economic growth, said Wan Zhe, chief economist at Beijing-based China National Gold Group."

China Eastern Airlines and China Southern Airlines will be the main carriers at the airport. The construction of designated airline spaces will be completed by September next year, Feng said. The roof of the main terminal building was sealed on New Year's Eve and internal decorations and installation of electromechanical equipment are underway. The main terminal building, covering 313,000 square meters, the size of 44 soccer fields, consists of a central hub and five arms resembling a phoenix spreading out its wings. The new airport's construction began at the end of 2014. The airport is expected to handle 72 million passenger trips, 620,000 departures and arrivals, and 2 million metric tons of cargo and mail annually by 2025."
0,"British writer Geoff Dyer, whose works cover a wide range of subjects and styles, speaks to Mei Jia. When he first visited China five years ago, British writer Geoff Dyer had an unusual request. He wanted to play ping pong. ""I just love playing it"", he says as he recalls being defeated by an 80-year-old Chinese player at the Shanghai Writers Club. But he claims he is the champion of his group of writers in Los Angeles, California, where he now lives. ""Some tech startup companies in LA have ping pong tables,"" he says. ""I see them but they are open only to their staff."" Dyer is an award-winning writer whose works cover a wide range of subjects and styles. He was winner of the 2011 National Book Critics Circle Award for Criticism; the E. M. Forster Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 2006; and he was the GQ Writer of 2009. Some critics hail him as one of the finest British writers in recent years. And he has won recognition from established writers like Zadie Smith and Japan's Haruki Murakami, the author of Norwegian Wood. Murakami, who is hugely popular in China, too, is the translator of Dyer's But Beautiful: A Book About Jazz into Japanese. Speaking about Murakami, Dyer jokes, saying: ""If your works get translated by Murakami, in Japan, you become a god."" Separately, he was involved in a writer-in-residence project aboard the American naval aircraft carrier George H.W. Bush for two weeks and turned out a book twice as long as it had to be. ""I had quite a lot to say. It was an unusual place, and it was an amazing time, an experience that one couldn't have as a civilian,"" he says, adding that another place that he would like to go would be the international space station.,Travel means a lot to Dyer's writing. He says:""It's like asking how do you feel about breathing. I just have the habit of doing it."" As Dyer enjoys his second trip to China, he says that he is also interested in visiting India. Dyer's current China trip will take him from Beijing to Suzhou and then to Shanghai. Speaking about China, Dyer says: ""I just love it for all the 'cliched' reasons: vibrant future, the energy, so positive, you feel it and you see it. It's incredibly energized, and specially if you come from a weary exhausted old country like England."" In his latest book White Sands: Experiences from the Outside World, he dedicates a whole chapter to the Forbidden City. And, in reviewer Jonathon Sturgeon's words on flavorwire.com, the chapter depicts ""a Dyer-like writer meeting a beautiful woman while doing book promotion in Beijing, and he wonders why momentous things tend to happen on the final night of travel."" The book contains Dyer's observations of the modern Chinese mentality, when he writes about ""Min waiting in the reception, prepunctual as always, never tired, always smiling and happy - but with an air of harriedness beneath that smile as she asked if I'd slept well."" And on the ancient Chinese palace complex, Dyer says: ""There were a lot of people here too, but the Forbidden City was the size of Cheltenham, so there was plenty of room for everyone. Jeez, it went on forever, and every bit looked exactly the same as every other bit: courtyards the size of football pitches, cloisters, sloping roofs with rooms beneath them."" His travel-log styled mixture of writing blurs the line between fiction and nonfiction. And each of his books is very different - he has written about jazz, photography, literary criticism and films.,Asked about his choice of topics, he says: ""There will always be things I would be interested in and curious about, therefore writing a book could be a continuing self-education. I just want to find out about a subject to my own satisfaction to see why it has a great effect on me."" Commenting on his works, James Wood in the New Yorker says: ""Geoff Dyer delights in producing books that are unique, like keys. There is nothing anywhere like Dyer's semi-fictional rhapsody about jazz, But Beautiful, or his book about the World War I, The Missing of the Somme, or his autobiographical essay about D. H. Lawrence, Out of Sheer Rage, or his travelogue Yoga for People Who Can't Be Bothered to Do It."" Dyer, who was born in 1958 in Cheltenham, England, and graduated from Corpus Christi College, Oxford, says his parents are not readers of his works, and they have no books in the house except for the only one by him. He adds his passion for writing started with avid reading, and his career was launched by writing reviews. Dyer, who currently teaches two classes a week at the University of Southern California, says:""The first stage of becoming a writer is to read a lot. The way you teach writing is by teaching reading."" Dyer's works have been translated into 25 languages. And some of his Chinese versions are done by writer and translator Kong Yalei. Incidentally, it was Kong who introduced Dyer's body of work to Zhejiang Literature and Art Publishing House. ""I really enjoy Dyer's works, so I started to translate them,"" Kong says.""But it's not easy. However, I've seldom seen a writer with the ability to bring sound and music to you when you are reading about them."" Meanwhile, Dyer has two books coming out in China this year, one of which is dedicated to his icon and friend John Berger.,Typically, in March, Beijing and cities like Shanghai, Suzhou and Chengdu see literary talks and exchanges between local audiences and writers from the United States, United Kingdom, France and Australia, as well as between Chinese literary voices and the foreign writers. Geoff Dyer is one of the writers featuring at the 11th Bookworm Literary Festival (March 8-25). And many more will be involved during the festival and other events including Francophonie (March 8-31) and the Australian Writers' Week (March 15-24). The Bookworm festival features a series of events including book talks, panel discussions, debates and performances. This year, women's writing and voices, as well as sci-fi writers are being featured in the events. Celebrated Chinese writers such as Yu Hua and A Lai will take part in the events, besides younger Chinese writers like Zhang Yueran, Ren Xiaowen and Xia Jia. More coming up: Yu Hua and Richard Flanagan 14:30, March 17 OWSpace Bookstore at Aegean Shopping Mall, Beijing The two writers will discuss history and its legacy on writing. Sylvain Neuvel and Fei Dao Sci-fi and Fantasy: The Magic of World-Building 14:00, March 18 Bookworm, Beijing Canadian writer Sylvain Neuvel will talk to Fei Dao, an assistant professor at Tsinghua University and an acclaimed sci-fi writer.

0,"Yanqing district, one of the three major competition zones for the 2022 Winter Olympics, ramped up efforts to develop winter sports and seek high-quality development of the ice and snow industry, in a bid to better prepare for the upcoming event. Song Haitian, deputy director of the Yanqing Winter Olympics organizing office, said alpine skiing, bobsleigh, luge and other events will be held in the district during the Winter Games, with about one fifth of all the gold medals to be awarded in Yanqing venues. He added that the district will take this opportunity to create favorable conditions for regional development and build it into a world famous ice and snow city, with the layout of ""one axis, two wings, and multiple points."" Song said that Yanqing district is currently working on guidelines and research to promote regional development. During the Games, it will work to ensure the success of the 2022 Winter Olympics, in an effort to promote the city and the district to the world. Yanqing will also take measures to manage the legacy from the Winter Olympics, in a bid to maintain a sustainable development of regional ecology, economy and society. In the future, the district aims to integrate winter sports and tourism, and build itself into a leisure destination all year around. As the major project of the ""one axis"" layout, the construction of Beijing's ice sports training base is well underway, according to Ma Zhiyong, deputy director of the Yanqing sports bureau. He said Beijing has also built outdoor skating rinks to meet the needs for public training and education. The ice sports training base began construction last September, which is expected to complete next May. Located in the central area of Yanqing district, the training base covers 87,000 square meters, and is equipped with a training gymnasium, a teaching management building, and an apartment building for athletes. The gymnasium is composed of six standard ice rinks and eight standard curling tracks and other functions. It will serve as the training base and city-level competition venue for various winter games, including ice hockey, short track speed skating, curling, and figure skating. As of this September, the project has completed 55 percent of the total work, with the main structure and interior decoration finished. In the meantime, to develop the ""two wings,"" Beijing is also promoting the renovation work of Vanke Shijinglong Ski Resort, Badaling Ski Resort and the launch of Qidi Qiaobo Ice and Snow Town, in a bid to improve the integration of ice and snow industry with other industries. Currently, Yanqing district is mulling over regulations on funding for sports industry and studying on the prospects of giving policy support to the integration of winter sports and tourism, according to Ma of the Yanqing sports bureau. Over the past three years, Yanqing has held 27 winter sports games, including four international competitions and eight national competitions. From 2017 to 2018, a total of 14 events covering winter sports competition, public activities and training have been held in the district, receiving about 1,000 athletes from 10 countries including China, Switzerland, and Norway. The number of ice and snow festivals also increased, such as the Yanqing Longqing Gorge Ice Lantern Festival, the Yanqing Ice and Snow Festival, and the Ice and Snow Carnival. In order to popularize winter sports among the general public and promote the Winter Olympics, Yanqing district has so far hosted 77 Winter Olympics-related lectures, and held winter sports training courses for three consecutive snow seasons, helping tens of thousands of students learn the basics of skiing and ice-skating. Activities to celebrate the World Snow Day, part of the ""Bring Children to the Snow"" campaign, were hosted in Yanqing in January, attracting more than 700 children to participate. The young participants, including foreign children and children with autism and disabilities, were able to learn about the Winter Olympics and its culture as well as experience skiing. Yanqing is actively cultivating skiing professionals. With the help from industry professionals, the district produced 23 A-level ski instructors, who are recognized by the International Ski Instructors Association and its 39 member states. Meanwhile, to meet the needs in the district, a ski gear service and maintenance training session was held, featuring top-notch ski instructors and assessment officers. Yanqing's sports bureau worked with a Swiss company to provide ski trainings, with 24 youngsters receiving the Swiss national ski instructor certification. The sports authorities also organized winter sports teams in the district to carry out various training sessions, and selected 55 athletes to participate in Beijing's first winter sports games. To further improve the air quality for the 2022 Winter Olympics, Yanqing also ramped up efforts in replacing coal-fired boilers with clean energy sources. Apart from boilers in its two central heating centers in the east and south area, Yanqing has completed the clean energy campaign, with a total of 1,178.2 tons of coal-fired boilers replaced by clean energy sources. After replacing the boilers in its two central heating centers this year, the district will use no coal in heating in its downtown areas. Meanwhile, the coal-to-clean-energy campaign is also underway in Yanqing's rural areas, with about 10,000 households from 46 villages working on replacing coal with clean energy."
0,"A private Beijing transport company has pledged to install 40 new charging stations next year in preparation for more electric buses. The move will take the number of charging stations cross the capital to 100, said Lian Xingye, deputy general manager of Beijing Junma Passenger Transport Co. Junma is one of several bus companies providing public transport services in Beijing, with most of its routes in Shunyi district. The company bought its first clean-energy vehicle, powered by liquefied natural gas, in 2012. Today, 90 percent of its 557 buses either run on LNG or electricity, according to its general manager, Men Bolai. Increasing the use of e-buses and encouraging more people to use public transport instead of driving are seen as vital to reduce air pollution in Beijing. The city government has offered transport companies subsidies to switch to green vehicles, and more than 65 percent of buses are expected to run on clean energy by the end of this year, said Wang Hao with the Beijing Transport Commission. Beijing has about 27,000 buses serving 1,200 routes. About 10 million journeys a day are made using these vehicles. Besides the environmental benefits, e-buses also have economic advantages. “Electric buses cost 1 yuan (15 US cents) a kilometer to run, while gas or diesel vehicles cost 2 yuan,” Lian said. “Engines powered by fossil fuels also need regular maintenance, which costs money, while electric engines don’t, making them more cost effective.”  However, challenges remain, such as the shortage of charging stations and low battery capacity.  Beijing Transport Commission now requires all bus parking lots to have charging stations, Wang said. China is promoting e-buses nationwide. Some 200,000 new e-buses were expected to be put into operation this year, according to Wu Chungeng, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport."
0,"BEIJING - The city of Beijing has full implementation of strict regulations for car-hailing services after a five months transition period.  Starting Saturday, platforms and drivers without licenses will not be able to provide such services in Beijing.  In December, the city's transport authorities issued regulations that featured a number of restrictions concerning drivers' household registration, car plate, vehicle model, age, and insurance.  According to the regulations, drivers must have a local residence permit and vehicles must be registered locally.  On Wednesday, Didi Chuxing and CAR received business licenses issued by Beijing transport authorities, bringing the total number to five.  China unveiled its first nationwide regulations for car-hailing services in July, granting them legal status."
0,"This year's upcoming Beijing Music Festival will kick off with two groundbreaking stage productions by Chinese-American director Chen Shi-zheng. With its quiet, tree-lined streets and courtyard houses, an old neighborhood in the southwest of the capital is home to the Peking Opera Theater Company of Beijing, which was founded in 1979. Several late Peking Opera masters, including Mei Lanfang, Shang Xiaoyun and Ma Lianliang, prepared the way for the establishment of the theater. ""It feels like the 1980s. This place offers you a glimpse of what the city used to be like,"" says Chinese-American director Chen Shi-zheng, who is busy with rehearsals at the opera company based in Beijing's Fengtai district. He is preparing his two stage productions - Farewell My Concubine and The Orphan of Zhao - that will open the upcoming Beijing Music Festival in their joint Asia premieres. Now in its 21st year, the Beijing Music Festival, which is being held from Oct 12 to 26, will present 21 performances which will include operas, orchestral symphonies and works of chamber music. Born in Changsha, Hunan province, Chen moved to New York at the age of 25 to gain his master's degree at the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University. Now in his early 50s, Chen is known for his stage works, including his complete 20-hour Kunqu Opera work, The Peony Pavilion, commissioned by the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in 1999. ""I have not staged my works in China for about 20 years and I am nervous about the reaction I will receive from Chinese audiences,"" adds Chen. Farewell My Concubine was created by Peking Opera master Mei Lanfang in 1922 and has become one of the most beloved stories played on the Chinese theatrical stage ever since. Set against the backdrop of the Chu-Han Contention, a civil war that followed the collapse of the Qin Dynasty (206-202 BC), it is a love story between the King of the Chu Kingdom, Xiang Yu, and his lover and concubine Yu, who gives her life to the man she loves when he and his kingdom are overthrown by his enemies. In his adaptation of Farewell My Concubine, Chen retains the singing from traditional Peking Opera while combining modern stage technology with elements such as dancing, lighting and even a real horse.,""I wanted to create a new version of this story based on the classics, but break away from the usual limitations of Peking Opera to create a contemporary theater vocabulary that would resonate with today's audiences,"" says Chen. ""I'm interested in exploring the relationship between contemporary art forms and their public appeal in metropolitan cities like Beijing. What can artists offer? In other words, why do people go to the theater to watch Peking Opera? ""Tradition is not merely about form; it's about the spirit that the form is built upon. The core value of inheriting tradition, in my opinion, is to let its spirit live in the life that surrounds us,"" he adds. The orchestra not only uses traditional Chinese musical instruments such as the erhu, sanxian and gong, but also has a five-piece band of Western musical instruments, including the violin, cello and harp. The director also uses interactive multimedia techniques as a vehicle to convey the inner voices of the characters. ""Keeping the traditional music style of Peking Opera is the core of the adaptation,"" says 80-year-old conductor Hu Bingxu, one of the most prominent conductors in China, who is not only the resident conductor at the Peking Opera Theater Company of Beijing but also a former conductor of several national companies, such as the China National Symphony Orchestra. ""Usually Peking Opera has simple stage sets, such as a table and two chairs. But Chen's innovations help the audience, especially younger people who have never seen a Peking Opera show before, to understand this traditional Chinese art."" As for The Orphan of Zhao, Chen adopted an entirely modern approach.,The opera, which premiered at the Lincoln Center Festival in New York in 2003, tells the story of an orphan's revenge against those who killed his family members when he was an infant. Written by Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368) dramatist Ji Junxiang, it was one of the first major Chinese plays to be translated into European languages. However, in his adaptation, Chen has blurred the backdrop of the opera's time and location. Through a series of workshops with a group of American actors and designers, a writer and a composer, Chen attempted to create a new form of theater expression that was ""neither Western nor Chinese, but rather a new kind of theater,"" in which these elements could equally coexist yet remain transparent. The Orphan of Zhao is the last part of a trilogy of Chinese classics created by Chen in 2001. He wrote them with the aim of sharing Chinese literary treasures on the world stage, ""because a classic Chinese story deserves to be told to the world over and over again, and not just by the Chinese,"" he says. As for the music, Mike Smith, an English music producer and musician, who is the music director for Chen's production of The Orphan of Zhao, says: ""My approach was to make the music sound more contemporary and less traditional. We wanted to move away from the familiar music syntax of the East both instrumentally and harmonically and make it sound really cool."" Smith first met Chen on the director's operatic stage production, Monkey: Journey to the West, an adaptation of Chinese classic novel, Journey to the West by Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) writer Wu Cheng'en. The production was staged at the Manchester International Festival in 2007 and Chen worked along with British musicians Damon Albarn and British artist Jamie Hewlett, the creators of the virtual band, Gorillaz. Smith, who has worked with Albarn for over 20 years, re-orchestrated the work for a largely electronic ensemble, and mixed it with standard orchestral instruments. ""I find working with Chen always forward-thinking. We have moved the story 'along' and not settled on a traditional context for both the libretto or the music,"" Smith says. ""Shakespeare is an international literary giant. This story from The Orphan of Zhao is the same. We can all relate to it and understand it in whatever context it is presented. That's what is so exciting about being involved with this production. Everyone will get something out of it."""
0,"A task force has been dispatched by the State Council, China's Cabinet, to check on teacher ethics and work styles in kindergartens across the country in an effort to prevent child abuse, the Ministry of Education said on Wednesday.  The State Council has required immediate punishment and rectification of any problems discovered during the inspections to prevent children from being hurt at kindergartens and ensure their safety and health, the ministry said in a notice released on its website.  The move follows reports of child abuse at the RYB Education New World Kindergarten in Beijing's Chaoyang district last week. Xiao Wen, director of Chaoyang's Education Commission and two other commission officials are being investigated for their negligence in handling the RYB case.  Investigations showed that a female teacher surnamed Liu, 22, is accused of using sewing needles to ""discipline"" children who would not sleep and Liu has been detained by police in Chaoyang, the district's public security bureau said in a release.  Also in its release, the Chaoyang public security bureau said online claims about children being collectively molested were rumors started by two women.  One woman, 31, was detained on an allegation of fabricating facts and disturbing public order. The other, 29, was given a warning and apologized on her personal social media account, police said without elaborating about the two women's identities or their motives for making the claims.  The police said the hard disk holding surveillance videos of the classroom had been damaged because of frequent forced power outages by a staff member after school, adding that police found no evidence of child abuse after viewing 113 hours of restored videos.  According to Beijing News, the Beijing Education Commission has started an inspection of the surveillance systems at all kindergartens in the city to make sure the devices are installed and functioning properly.  Regarding news reports saying a parent had claimed his child was fed unidentified white pills, the bureau said in its news release that the child's father, surnamed Gou, admitted his child had not been treated that way. Rather, it said, he had told his child to make the claim.  However, questions still remain about how police investigated the incident and made their conclusions. People are calling for more details to be released and more explanations to be made.  RYB Education Inc, the parent company of the kindergarten involved, released a letter on Wednesday apologizing and saying it didn't expect forgiveness but would upgrade its surveillance system and try to make the operation of its kindergartens ""as transparent as possible"".

0,"Sun Xiaofang, a 25-year-old pregnant math teacher at a school in Beijing, remembers one particular middle school biology class clearly.  Her teacher glossed over the basic anatomical and physiological differences between males and females in a textbook in less than 20 minutes, telling the students to ""read it by yourselves after class"".  ""Girls flipped over those pages and blushed, and all the boys kept silent,"" Sun said. ""The atmosphere in the classroom was one of embarrassment and hilarity.""  That 20-minute lesson accounted for the entire formal sex education she received, an all too familiar experience for young Chinese. Talking directly about sex is often deemed difficult by parents.  ""It is too late for students to receive sex education after they enter adolescence,"" said Pan Suiming, director of the Renmin University of China's Institute of Sexuality and Gender.      Talking about sex remains taboo in Chinese culture. Some experts consider a lack of proper sex education, particularly in schools, as one of the factors leading to serious health problems in China, such as the growing numbers of HIV infections and staggeringly high abortion rates.  Zhang Yinjun, director of the AIDS Prevention Education Project for Chinese Youth, said that HIV is now growing fastest among Chinese adolescents, and more than 90 percent of infections occur through sexual relations.  From January to September last year, there were 96,000 new HIV infections, with 24.4 percent in the 20-29 age group, according to China's National Center for AIDS/STD Control and Prevention.  Teenage pregnancies and premarital abortions are also rising. The National Health and Family Planning Commission reported in 2015 that around 13 million abortions are performed annually in China. By comparison, the United States, with roughly a quarter of China's population, has fewer than 1 million abortions per year.    Today, an increasing number of Chinese adolescents are engaging in premarital sex, in many cases with only vague knowledge of safe sex practices, experts say.  ""As a result of secretive sex education in China, most unmarried Chinese adolescents know little about the consequences of premarital sex,"" said Li Yinhe, a Chinese sexologist.  China is making strides to break its silence on sex. The Ministry of Education recently issued a guideline suggesting that higher education institutions set up public courses on health education to teach students about sex and reproductive health.  In recent years, there have been increased calls for better sex education in China. Liu Wenli, a professor at Beijing Normal University, has been running a public WeChat account called ""Love and Life"" since 2014, offering a free subscription service on sex education information.  Liu and her team have also been popularizing their Cherish Life sex education textbooks for Chinese children. Each month, the team visits kindergartens and primary schools in Beijing to observe lessons and coach teachers.  Sun, the pregnant math teacher, often thinks about the sex education of her child.  ""It will definitely be better than mine,"" she said.  Xinhua    (China Daily 07/17/2017 page4)"
0,"Philosophy is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, the mind and language. The word comes from the Greek philosophia, combining the words philo (love of ), and sophia (wisdom). Yet the rapid advance of science and technology has made many feel that philosophy is increasingly irrelevant in modern times. The fact that it is incapable of solving practical problems that have emerged as a result of rapid social and technological development has reinforced people's skepticism toward the academic discipline. And for a long time, philosophy has been regarded as something of a riddle by many observers. Li Kun, a doctoral candidate majoring in art philosophy at Central South University in Changsha, Hunan province, said: ""Philosophy raises new questions, and it gives people a deep and profound understanding of issues. And it has guided, if not created, new branches of science to resolve these questions."" Li is among the 8,000 participants from 121 countries and regions who attended the 24th World Philosophy Congress in Beijing, which ends on Monday. Philosophy took center stage in China in the 1980s after the ""cultural revolution"" (1966-76) and the reform and opening-up of the country both created a collective intellectual hunger, and also brought about the possibility of accessing Western thought and embracing new thinking. Yet a period that featured the popularity of Western thought and the further decline of traditional Chinese culture and philosophy gradually gave way to rapid economic growth and extensive social evolution in the early 1990s. Development flourished as idealism ebbed. Difficulties in society and worsening environmental problems have awakened many to the harsh challenges the nation faces, which they fear will jeopardize developmental sustainability. Zhang Fan, a doctoral student in philosophy at Southeast University in Nanjing, Jiangsu province, who is taking part in the congress, said philosophy can be a way for humans to resolve the challenges they face. Philosophers have their own way of contributing, Zhang said. ""Before asking how to solve problems, philosophers will contribute to the solution by researching the problems, by coming to an understanding of the issues, and by communicating what they have come to understand to the world."" It is the first time China has hosted the World Congress of Philosophy, organized by the International Federation of Philosophical Societies, and established at the instigation of the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization at the Amsterdam congress in 1948.,Zhang Shiying, a 97-year-old philosophy professor at Peking University, told the media the congress marked a significant and progressive step in world philosophy's integration of and exchanges between Chinese and Western philosophies. Themed ""Learn to be human"", the Beijing gathering is the largest in the event's history. The federation's president, Dermot Moran, said in his speech at the opening ceremony on Aug 13, ""The Congress is of groundbreaking and monumental significance for the future expansion and development of philosophy in its global context."" Lin Jianhua, president of Peking University, said in his opening speech, ""The theme shows the close connections between contemporary philosophical reflection and common concerns of human beings, as well as philosophy's fundamental value in shaping human beings' spiritual life and public discourse."" Li Xiaolong, a retiree in his 80s from Jinan, Shandong province, who is interested in studies of the ancient Chinese philosophers Confucius and Lao Tzu, has been closely following the Beijing gathering. That about 60 percent - or 5,000 - of the participants are from China, and many of them are interested in philosophy and are not professional researchers, shows not only the success of the meeting, but more important, Chinese people's new recognition of the importance of philosophy and knowledge, Li said. China has transformed its growth pattern from quantitative to qualitative, and paid more attention to addressing profound societal, cultural and ecological issues. ""It means a paradigm shift to sustainability, fairness and justice, which entails the rise of new thinking and more inclusive philosophical environments,"" Li said. Although some participants' ideas and papers appear ""ridiculous"" to a general audience, they are admitted by the Congress, and they are entitled to air their views. Li added: ""That's exactly the spirit of philosophy and shows how it has progressed. Thinking and debating should always be encouraged to help people approach the truth."" The Congress is generally considered a platform for the exchange of ideas among philosophers, particularly those from Asia, Africa and Latin America who have long been represented - if not sometimes ignored - by their Western counterparts. Moran said: ""This congress will also, hopefully, have an enduring impact on international cultural relations, promoting mutual understanding, respect for traditions and trust around the world. New intercultural dialogues will be initiated; new international academic partnerships will be formed; hopefully new philosophy will emerge."" Hans-Julius Schneider, a professor of philosophy at Potsdam University in Germany, said that in an era haunted by terrorism, cultural and religious conflicts have emerged. Ethnocentrism and relativism should be avoided. What is needed is a more neutral concept - spirit - a philosophical idea that is shared by different cultures and religions, to define differences as well as commonalities, Schneider said.,The Beijing meeting also has symbolic meaning and practical value in the eyes of many, including the participants, as it provides global philosophical circles with inspiration from China. Luca Maria Scarantino, secretary-general of the federation, said, ""We perceive a growing awareness that what we usually term 'philosophy' is dramatically defective without the intellectual legacy of Chinese philosophy, culture and spirituality. ""Because of its inclusiveness and scholarly influence, this Congress may therefore represent a historical opportunity for reassessing the sense of philosophy, for enhancing the theoretical diversity of philosophical concepts, and for rethinking in widely comprehensive ways the notion of 'being' - or 'becoming' - human."" Mogobe Ramose, a professor of philosophy at the University of South Africa, thinks that the Confucian virtue ren, which denotes the feeling of a virtuous human experience, shares similarities with ubuntu, a term used in Bantu languages to mean humanity, or ""the belief in a universal bond of sharing that connects all humanity"". This is because both require us to put ourselves in the place of others and spread love from oneself to others. Graham Parkes, a professor of philosophy at the University of Vienna in Austria, urged people to care more about living creatures beyond humans. The thoughts in traditional Chinese philosophy that all exists in qi - believed to be a vital force forming part of any living entity - and that all things form an organic whole are what modern times need most, he said. The Congress has 99 sections of contributed papers: including one entitled ""Chinese philosophy"" with four sub-headings: Pre-Qin philosophy (221BC-207BC); Philosophy from the Han (202BC-220) to the Qing (1644-1911); Modern Chinese philosophy; and Contemporary Chinese philosophy; as well as Confucian Philosophy, Buddhist Philosophy and Taoist Philosophy. There is a new section entitled Contemporary Philosophies in China, in recognition of the fact that not all philosophy in the country is Chinese, and also a separate section on Marxist Philosophy. Moran added: ""Clearly, these new sections are meant to reflect the complexity of the Chinese tradition of philosophy ... . We have much to learn from one another if we open our ears and our hearts and come prepared to have our presuppositions challenged in an atmosphere of friendly and supportive collegiality."",Tu Weiming, a professor of philosophy at Peking University and professor emeritus and senior fellow at the Asia Center at Harvard University, played a key role in China winning the bid to host the conference, over Brazil. ""The first character in The Analects of Confucius is ""learning"", or xue in Chinese. Learning to be human is a ceaseless process of self-realization,"" he wrote in an article for China Daily eight years ago. This coincides with the themes of today's Congress - self, community, nature, and spirit and tradition. Humanity is a notion central to Confucianism. Tu, in advocating New Confucianism, firmly believes the ancient philosophy contains rich resources of wisdom to help deal with present-day problems, and that China's fast development has provided an ideal platform for New Confucianism to unfold. ""The sun of philosophy rose in Greece, but should not set in Greece"", he added. Its rays should be able to fall on the whole world, including countries with ancient civilizations, such as those in Asia and Latin America. In the 1980s, long lines formed outside bookstores in China for the newly published translated works of the German philosopher Martin Heidegger. But nowadays Chinese are taking a more measured approach in their observations of both Western and Chinese philosophy. This represents a historical turning point from the blind pursuit of Western thought, which dates to the late Qing Dynasty, to more rational attitudes to ""others"" and ""self"". Ding Yun, a professor of philosophy at Fudan University, Shanghai, wrote in a thesis published last year, ""The Chinese people now have their own judgment of Western philosophical history as a whole, and they are intent on drawing nutrition from it to nourish modern Chinese philosophy"" so as to better reflect and meet the practical needs of Chinese society. Tu believes that now is the right time for a dialogue among civilizations that focuses on the core values necessary for human survival and progress. ""Civilizations do not clash. Only ignorance does. The danger of shared vulnerability as well as the hope of shared aspiration impels us to move beyond unilateralism in order to work toward a dialogical civilization,"" Tu said. In the age of reason, when the Enlightenment movement began to shape the Western mindset, leading thinkers such as Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716), Voltaire (1694-1778) and Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-78), took China as an important reference country and Confucianism as a significant reference culture. Tu said that with an eye on the future, it is likely that the spirit of East Asian modernity imbued with Confucian characteristics will serve as a reference point for public intellectuals in North America and Western Europe as well as for intellectuals elsewhere in the world.

1,"Chinese prosecutors vowed to enhance their supervisory role and join hands with other countries to safeguard personal information in the age of big data through the rule of law to effectively ensure data security and further improve internet development. ""Prosecuting authorities in China have strengthened their efforts to fight crimes resulting from privacy leaks, and we're willing to increase international communication to jointly build an open, cooperative and safe cyberspace,"" said Zhang Jun, procurator-general of the Supreme People's Procuratorate. He made the remarks on Thursday when sharing Chinese prosecutors' experience in protecting personal information during a forum at the 5th World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, Zhejiang province. The top procuratorate's official statistics showed that more than 8,700 people were accused by prosecutors of the crime of harming people's personal information from January 2016 to September. This not only means that privacy leaks have become a hot problem in the internet era, but also brings new judicial challenges for prosecutors, he said. Given that the problem is serious, Zhang said that Chinese judicial officials, including prosecutors, have taken a series of steps to protect people's privacy, with powerful legislation and stricter law enforcement. ""To better solve it, we need a joint force, as cyberspace governance is a task for every walk of life, such as internet companies, technicians and netizens,"" he said. A team specialized in handling internet-related crimes has been set up by the top procuratorate, and some regional prosecuting authorities have also improved the quality of related prosecutions by inviting internet specialists to act as advisors, he said. Jia Yu, chief prosecutor of the Zhejiang Provincial People's Procuratorate, agreed, confirming that finding a balance between data development and personal information has been a big challenge for judicial authorities from home and abroad. ""It's good to see our country boosts protection and gives heavier penalties to privacy offenders,"" he said. ""But we need a clearer distinction between sensitive, important and general personal information in the current laws, as different kinds of information require us to use different ways to safeguard and punish the wrongdoers."" Wu Shenkuo, an associate law professor at Beijing Normal University, spoke highly of Chinese lawmakers' increasing capacity to guarantee privacy in recent years. ""For instance, privacy protection and online platforms' duties have been highlighted and clarified in the Cybersecurity Law and the E-Commerce Law."" He said it is good that the nation's top legislature has put forward a plan to make laws on personal information protection and data security on its agenda, adding that he believed that more clarified laws would contribute greatly to alleviating privacy leaks. Prosecutors nationwide also need to fight crime caused by privacy leaks through bilateral or multilateral agreements with other countries, ""as the use and development of big data is a global problem"", Jia said. Zhuang Rongwen, minister of the Cyberspace Administration of China, said that international cooperation should be further developed, such as how to prevent online risks, effectively share information and fight crimes. As cooperation is being promoted, ""we should make better use of big data, especially exploring how to use it to improve people's livelihoods, and expand security education and enhance people's security awareness while surfing the internet"", he added. Aleksandr Konyuk, prosecutor-general of the General Prosecutor's Office of Belarus, revealed a survey from his nation to attendees at the forum, which stated that 42 percent of internet users in Belarus suffered online threats from January to September, and these attacks resulted in serious information leaks. He applauded the fact that more countries were willing to solve the problem by increasing international cooperation."
0,"Heather Elgood says those who attend her class at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, include students in their 20s and even 70s. The older students, she says, are usually bankers and lawyers, who have collected Chinese ceramics for years and want to learn more about them. Elgood is the course director for postgraduate diploma studies in Asian art at SOAS. She says her teaching emphasizes two things: the direct touch her students from different parts of the world have with objects of art and the history of such works. In light of a new cooperation established between her university and the Guardian Education Center in Beijing, Elgood says she hopes her experience and expertise will also benefit Chinese collectors and art lovers. A subsidiary of the Beijing-based Guardian Group, the education center, along with SOAS and the Art Institute of Chicago, a large US museum, launched the international program in November. The program will offer both short- and long-term courses on art, art history and the market to artists, patrons and buyers, as well for others interested in art. A small class is expected to have about 20 students.,The Guardian Group also owns China Guardian Auctions, one of the country's top auctioneers, and Guardian Art Center in Beijing, which regularly hosts exhibitions. The first course will open in May on the overseas collections of ancient Chinese ceramics and bronze wares. Lecturers, including experts from Europe and the United States, will share their latest studies on major British collections of Chinese porcelain and US assemblages of Chinese bronze wares dating to the Shang (c. 16th century-11th century BC) and Zhou (c. 11th century-256 BC) dynasties. Wang Tao, curator of Chinese art at the Art Institute of Chicago, says he hopes potential students for the new program can first visit his museum to view the exhibition, Mirroring China's Past: Emperors and Their Bronzes. The display of archaic Chinese bronze will open on Feb 25 and provide glimpses of Bronze Age history.,Wang is also the museum's executive director of a program called Initiatives in Asia. He says Chinese visitors were a rapidly growing international audience group at the museum last year. He says the exhibition and the course together will shed new light on the research on the aesthetic value of Chinese bronze housed abroad and how the items have been passed down generations. Kou Qin, board chairman of the Guardian Education Center, says that besides the international program they will also offer courses on other art genres, such as classical Chinese painting, in cooperation with local cultural institutes. The center will also hold another course, on weekends from April to June 2018, introducing ink-brush masters of 20th-century Chinese art.,The rapid growth of the Chinese art market has boosted people's interest in art and collecting. There are speculators who seek short-term revenues but more buyers want to be serious collectors through systematic learning. Elgood says collectors should learn so they don't waste money and don't need to rely on dealers to buy for them. She hopes more Chinese appreciate the country's heritage and respect for the technical quality of its objects. This will make a large contribution in terms of self-respect and identity of Chinese culture, she says."
1,"The international business community is looking forward to the implementation of China's Foreign Investment Law, United Family Healthcare CEO Roberta Lipson said on the sidelines of the China Development Forum in Beijing on March 23. ""We're looking forward to the special implementing regulations as it has to do with our industry, because there's always special management of healthcare investment,"" Lipson said. Lipson, who established China's first foreign-owned hospital in 1997 and experienced the complicated process to set up a company in China as a foreigner, is very excited to see healthcare deleted from the proposed negative list. ""We'll have national treatment in all aspects, so that will take away a lot of the restrictions,"" Lipson said. The newly adopted Foreign Investment encourages foreign business people including Lipson to invest more in the Chinese market. This carries great potential and is particularly relevant in the healthcare industry as China's population ages. ""That's why healthcare is so important. As China ages, the demands for healthcare will continue to increase. And the system really needs to be supplemented with more private investment in order to handle the heavy load — not only in acute healthcare, but also senior living, rehabilitation medicine and hospitals,"" Lipson said. With confidence in China's commitment to protect foreign companies' rights, Lipson will continue to bring the latest technology and healthcare to the country, because it is so important to have continuity in healthcare, she said. ""We've just opened a new hospital in Guangzhou. We also have two new investments, one in Hangzhou, one in Shenzhen that we'll be working on this year and one new hospital in Beijing,"" Lipson said. United Family Healthcare's expansion and Lipson's continued investment in the Chinese market is based on her optimistic outlook on China's economic development, as healthcare is a long-term cause. ""I think (the Chinese economy) will continue to develop, hopefully strongly, and I'm hoping all the tensions between the US and China will be resolved, and then both economies will develop more,"" Lipson said. The Foreign Investment Law was adopted at the closing meeting of the second session of the 13th National People's Congress on March 15, and aims to improve transparency of foreign investment policies and ensure foreign-invested enterprises participate in market competition on an equal basis. The law will take effect on Jan 1, 2020 and then China will manage foreign investment according to a system of pre-establishment national treatment plus a negative list."
1,"A Beijing kindergarten has agreed to pay an environmental protection association 100,000 yuan ($14,500) to settle a dispute over a running track that contained potentially toxic substances. Beijing High People's Court announced the result on Monday via its official microblog, saying that Liu Shikun Wanxiang Xintian Kindergarten and the China Social Assistance Foundation had come to the agreement following a period of mediation. The money will be used to remove the offending running track and for environmental protection, the court quoted the plaintiff as saying. It was China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation that originally filed the case against the kindergarten at the capital's No 4 Intermediate People's Court in June, accusing it of failing to replace its running track despite concerns that it was causing sickness among children. There had been complaints of children suffering nosebleeds, skin reactions and vomiting after using the track, which was renovated in April last year. Similar reports of illnesses related to synthetic running tracks and playgrounds appeared at other schools in Beijing, Shanghai and Hebei province during this period, attracting the attention of the public, education experts, the government, parents and environmental protection institutes.  During the two sessions in March, the Education Ministry said it was working with other government departments to draft new standards for school running tracks. Education Minister Chen Baosheng said a lack of updated standards was to blame for the issues reported last year, with some schools still adhering to criteria that were set two decades ago. ""There are also problems with the bidding process,"" he said, noting that price, rather than quality, was often a deciding factor. Despite Chen's assurances, Ma Yong, who represented the plaintiff in the case, said he still had his concerns.  ""The new standards are a veil. As the weather warms, the problems associated with these running tracks may reappear,"" he was quoted as saying by Caixin.  ""What we wanted to expose with this case was the disordered management in those industries that provide track-building materials, as well as the government's inadequate level of supervision.""  The case, the first of its kind since the toxic track problem was exposed last year, would not be the last, according to Ma  ""After all, we cannot rely on governmental supervision alone to solve these problems,"" he said."
1,"China and the United States will hold talks on trade and economic issues in Beijing on Thursday and Friday, marking the first high-level meeting since the bilateral trade dispute escalated in March. The Ministry of Commerce announced on Wednesday that a US delegation led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, visiting as US President Donald Trump's special envoy, will exchange views on China-US economic and trade issues with Vice-Premier Liu He, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee. The US delegation also includes Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, Larry Kudlow, assistant to the president for economic policy, and Peter Navarro, assistant to the president for trade and manufacturing policy. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Wednesday it is in the best interests of the two countries to resolve disputes and maintain the overall stability of bilateral business relations through negotiations. Taking into account the size of the Chinese and US economies and the complexity of the relationship, it may not be realistic to expect one meeting to resolve all the problems, she said at a news briefing. Experts remain ""cautiously optimistic"" about the trade talks, even as the Trump administration already threatened to impose tariffs on up to $150 billion in Chinese imports while China has vowed to retaliate against US exports if Washington moves forward with that plan. Chen Wenling, chief economist at the China Center for International Economic Exchanges, said the topics under discussion surely will not be limited to trade, because the US also wants to promote its ""America First"" strategy by containing China's ability to attract foreign direct investment. ""The US also is deeply concerned about China's industrial upgrades, technology transfers, currency rate, talent flows and intellectual property protection. It also wants to relieve the downward pressure on its stock market,"" she said. ""China's firm stance has prompted Trump to send all his top economic officials for trade negotiations to avert further escalation or a trade war,"" said Xue Rongjiu, deputy director of Beijing-based China Society for WTO Studies. Zhang Monan, a researcher at the China Center for International Economic Exchanges, said the codependency of China and the US is a highly reactive relationship. ""When one country changes the terms of the engagement, the other, feeling scorned, usually responds in kind,"" Zhang said."
1,"Freelancers and small and medium-sized companies that yearn for better working environments can increasingly avail themselves of a new option, co-working spaces. With the rise of millennials in the workforce and the government's supportive policies such as the so-called mass entrepreneurship innovation, the co-working space sector is booming, along with much of China's emerging sharing economy. According to an annual report released by the National Development and Reform Commission, more than 5.5 million new companies were registered last year, growing 24.5 percent year-on-year. By the end of 2016, the country had nearly 26 million registered enterprises, up 18.8 percent year-on-year. And the report noted that 41.7 percent of the entrepreneurs are young people, especially millennials. Seeing the huge potential in innovating away from traditional working offices, Hu Jing, the former executive vice-president of Chinese property developer Greenland Holding Group Co Ltd, established his co-working startup Distrii, to offer co-working spaces, coupled with online mobile office solutions. ""As more cities in China become highly developed and business concentrated, traffic congestion, air pollution and other city diseases pop up now, and the cost of commuting also has increased. All those problems are the real pain points for cities and will also reduce people's work efficiency,"" said Hu, now CEO of Distrii. Hu aims to build a community that allows employees to set up workplaces in the nearest co-working offices, instead of traveling for hours to a far-away office. ""Advances in technologies will enable us to live in the flexible, mobile, productive and convenient working environment, marking a key point to the smarter future. ""Co-workers are able to deal with company tasks online via our mobile office solutions and communicate with other company employees in the working building to expand their social circles,"" he said. According to statistics on the official website, more than 450 companies have registered to use properties offered by the Shanghai-based co-working space operator. Currently, Distrii has set up 15,000 working spaces in four cities, Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Singapore. The company said it would unveil its flagship franchise in Singapore next April. In September, the company announced it had raised 200 million yuan in series A financing to further expand its light-asset office network and start to tap into overseas markets in the Asia-Pacific, Southeast Asia and North America regions. ""Our co-working mode is more than simply renting working offices. We aim to connect people with the facilities via the internet, making them into part of the smart city plan,"" Hu added. Once users sign up to use the co-working building, they can simply use smartphones to unlock the office door and check in automatically via the internet. And the serviced offices will offer more functions, including tele-conferencing and video-conferencing. ""Currently, we especially target small and medium-sized companies, which account for around 70 percent of the total domestic firms, aiming to help them reduce the costs on operation and IT spending."" A report released by consultancy iResearch showed that there is huge potential in China's co-working industry. According to the report, the domestic market in China reached 4.29 billion yuan ($650 million) in 2016, and the number is expected to hit 9.35 billion yuan by 2019. Feng Chao, an analyst at internet research company Analysys, noted that co-working companies need to offer favorable prices and comfortable working environments to accumulate enough users. ""The key is to introduce more value-added services,"" Feng said. ""It should be more than simply providing renting offices and should involve more needed services, such as training and a community network."""
0,"Beijing plans to recruit 30 junior high school students and train them into becoming professionals at restoring cultural relics for the Forbidden City amid a shortage of such talents, according to Beijing Youth Daily. Beijing Union University, Beijing International Vocational Education School and the Palace Museum this year jointly launched a pilot education program to train professional restoration experts. The students will study cultural relic reconstruction at the Beijing International Vocational Education School for three years, followed by two years of vocational education at Beijing Union University. After further study, they can be awarded bachelor's degrees. The pilot program is aimed at cultivating more local professional talents. Shan Jilin, the curator of the Palace Museum, once told Chinese media that insufficient career paths for young people had resulted in a lack of professional restoration experts. The hukou, or household registration system, makes it hard for young experts to work in the museum. To restore all of the cultural relics in the Palace Museum with existing experts will take at least 100 years, according to the museum. In order to cultivate more professionals in the field, the museum launched the major in cultural relic repair with the Beijing International Vocational Education School in 2015, and recruited about 20 students in the first year. So far, 35 students have been recruited. Besides general courses including Chinese, math and politics, the students also learn professional knowledge about relic repair, including basic knowledge of cultural relics, the history of arts and the basic methods of relic protection, according to Qian Weidong, the director of the Beijing International Vocational Education School. Teachers were mostly from the Palace Museum, Qian added. Professional restoration experts have attracted widespread attention from the general public after the success of the three-episode TV documentary,  which premiered on China Central Television at the beginning of last year."
1,"Flagship Beijing roast duck restaurant Da Dong is expanding its overseas presence by teaming up with Dubai-based JA Resorts and Hotels, as the latter is eager to attract more Chinese tourists. Peking roast duck is a signature dish in the culinary culture of China's capital, and established premium bistro Da Dong is among the best-loved restaurants specializing in the dish. Award-winning chef Dong Zhenxiang is targeting customized menus at diners seeking a taste of Beijing while lounging beside a Maldivian beach at JA's Manafaru Island resort. ""One of the benefits from this cooperation is that we can raise our international reputation,"" Dong said. ""For the Chinese market, I think it's significant to have some key elements for them, and one is food,"" said Rob Cunningham, vice-president of food and beverage in JA Resorts and Hotels. ""I have been living in China for eight years and I know the relationship between people and food is so fundamental."" He said he picked Da Dong to partner with the resort brand because Chinese consumers identify with, trust and understand the brand. Having the Da Dong menu in the restaurant is an important business strategy to attract Chinese visitors to JA resorts, and to encourage higher spending. Anthony Ross, CEO of JA Resorts and Hotels, said the group's Manafaru resort hosted over 5,000 holiday goers from China in the past year, accounting for about 50 percent of total guests. The collaboration with Da Dong showed the group's determination to raise its service to the next level, he added. This is not the first time Da Dong has operated abroad. In 2017, the brand opened its first restaurant in New York. The Da Dong menu can also be found on cruises in destinations including the Caribbean and Japan. Dong admitted it can be hard for Chinese restaurants to establish a presence abroad, due to ""cultural differences"". The influence of real Chinese food abroad is still relatively small, he noted. After the restaurant opened in New York, home to some of the world's most discerning and hard-to-please taste buds, Da Dong has had a tough time impressing the local critics. ""After the New York restaurant, we have been thinking why we did it? Because we wanted to expand in the overseas market－but how?"" said Dong. ""The one in New York is more of an artisan bistro, a new concept, but it is hardly making any profit."" He said improving local management and finding suitable local ingredients have posed great challenges. Despite Da Dong's global ambitions, 2018 was a tough year for its culinary business domestically. Dong said, ""It was a cruel year and the situation is severe."" According to a report by culinary consultancy Chonghowe Creativity Co Ltd, 10 percent of restaurants in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen in Guangdong province, closed their doors every month in the past year. Nationwide, only 20 percent of restaurants have proved profitable, it found. ""There is no efficient solution to that,"" Dong said. ""You can't stop the trend, but whether it's a heated market or a slow one, for a restaurant you should always focus on the price-performance ratio."" While proud of the brand's traditional heritage, Dong said he has not ruled out the possibility of introducing cutting-edge technologies and modern management models to the company's sub-brands to make it more efficient and budget-friendly for younger consumers. Meanwhile, the core values of its high-end bistro will always remain its service and craftsmanship, Dong said."
0,"China's use of natural gas surged by 19 percent in 2017, as areas across northern China switched to this relatively clean fossil fuel and away from highly polluting coal in residential heating and industrial uses, according to data from the former Ministry of Environmental Protection, now called the Ministry of Ecology and Environment. This enabled those in Beijing and surrounding areas to enjoy many clear, blue-sky days this past winter, in sharp contrast with the heavy air pollution seen just a year ago. Increased use of natural gas is a key part of plans to reach the national priority goals of creating an ecological civilization and higher-quality growth. These goals were stressed at the recent two sessions meetings of the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Beijing. Air pollution in northern China is usually worse in the winter, but this past winter saw unprecedented improvement. Largely due to the policy decision to shift to natural gas for heating and many industrial uses, the average concentration in Beijing of the most hazardous small particulate matter, PM2.5, fell in January by 70 percent year-on-year to 34 micrograms per cubic meter, the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau said in a statement. It was the first time the figure was under the national standard safe level of 35, the bureau said. However, recent weeks have seen many days of high air pollution, although coming weeks are forecast to be clear. From October to January, all 28 cities in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, also known as Jing-Jin-Ji, and surrounding areas saw winter air quality improve. For example, Shijiazhuang in Hebei province saw a decrease of 52.4 percent. Jining in neighboring Shandong province saw the smallest decrease, 8.4 percent, according to the ministry. ""The dramatic improvement in air quality mainly resulted from effective and tougher controls on emissions and advantageous weather to disperse pollutants,"" said Li Xiang, director of air quality management at the capital's Environmental Protection Bureau. Restrictions covered many sources, such as factories, vehicles and the burning of coal, she said, adding that more than 11,000 polluting companies were closed or moved. In 2013, Premier Li Keqiang announced goals to reduce pollution throughout the country. This was a fundamental change of direction from the previous emphasis solely on rapid GDP growth. Since then, policies to shift toward cleaner industry and energy brought down the average concentration of PM2.5 by almost 40 percent from 2013 in the Jing-Jin-Ji region. In Beijing, the average concentration of PM2.5 went down from 89.5 micrograms per cubic meter in 2013 to 58 mcg per cu m for the entire year of 2017－below the target of 60 set out when the campaign was launched and 36 percent below the 2013 level of 90. Throughout China, 338 cities saw an average reduction of 6.5 percent from 2016 levels. Recent research by the Energy Policy Institute of Chicago estimates that the reductions in air pollution since 2013 add 3.3 years to life expectancy in Beijing and, in Hebei province, 4.5 years in Baoding and 5.3 years in Shijiazhuang.,This year's rapid shift from coal to natural gas has led to shortages. According to the Ministry of Environmental Protection, around 100,000 families and some schools temporarily lacked heat in December. The government stepped in with a combination of measures, including allowing some additional use of coal and moving natural gas from industrial uses to residential and from southern China to the north. The National Development and Reform Commission also ordered Beijing to restart a coal-fired power plant that had been shut down in March last year. Natural gas prices soared in December. The price of liquefied natural gas in China jumped from 4,000 yuan ($605) per metric ton to more than 10,000 yuan per ton. However, the price was brought down to 5,613.6 yuan per ton by mid-January, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics. Han Xiaoping, chief information officer of China Energy Net Consulting, said the current natural gas shortage is due to insufficient domestic gas resources and the lack of distributed gas storage infrastructure, especially underground storage tanks. In addition to building more natural gas infrastructure, the strategy for alleviating future shortages is to concentrate natural gas use in residential and industrial uses, where it makes the most difference in reducing pollution. The modern ultra-supercritical coal-fired electrical power plants that China is building are not as clean as natural gas turbines, but they are far cleaner than the very small burners, so it is seen as making sense to concentrate coal mostly in electrical power generation, as is now done in developed countries. Lauri Myllyvirta, a coal and air pollution expert at Greenpeace in Beijing, said: ""Shifting small boilers or household heating from coal to gas definitely leads to big air quality gains. That is the sector where natural gas makes most sense in China. If you look at what happened in the last winter, the local policies were very focused on gas. In the next years, the policy is more balanced between geothermal, biomass, electric heating and gas. I definitely think that that broader mix, including emissions-free sources as well, will be better and might avoid some of the problems we saw this winter."" He also said that the government's 2021 heating plan, which stiffens building insulation standards, will require retrofitting the insulation of rural houses, so gas demand from heating will decline. This ties in with the broader policy of upgrading industrial transformation. ""If you think about where China is at right now, there is a need to scale down construction and the reliance on infrastructure projects and real estate to drive growth. At this point, training some of the people in the construction sector to do retrofits would make an enormous amount of sense,"" Myllyvirta said.,The most direct beneficiaries of the switch from coal to natural gas for rural heating and industry are the villagers and workers who no longer have to work with coal or breathe its emissions. Michal Meidan, vice-president for research at Energy Aspects, a London-based energy consulting company, said: ""Natural gas is a big improvement over coal in terms of pollution but also in terms of worker safety. Worker accidents and mining accidents all have been rampant and a source of concern for many years. By switching to natural gas, you get fewer accidents in the industrial workplace. You don't need the big piles of coal you did to fuel furnaces."" Myllyvirta, of Greenpeace, said: ""In the winter, we know that heating is an important source of outdoor pollution affecting cities and so on. But the biggest health impact of heating with coal is the indoor pollution of people living in houses where coal is used for heating and cooking. Beijing's average PM2.5 is now around 60 (micrograms per cubic meter). If you heat with coal, you easily have several hundreds or even more than 1,000 inside your house."" According to the World Health Organization, local smog in general－which leads to increased risk of stroke, heart disease, asthma, and lung cancer－consists of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and dust and other particles. Also, carbon dioxide emissions lead to global warming, though they are not locally harmful. Sulfur dioxide is created mostly by burning coal. Nitrogen oxides, and the ground-level ozone that is created when they interact with sunlight, come mostly from motor vehicles. Dust and other particles are made airborne largely by construction, truck traffic or wind from desert areas. Natural gas is much cleaner than coal, both globally and locally. Locally, it produces almost no sulfur dioxide and less nitrogen oxides than is created by gasoline or diesel engines. Recent analysis by a team at Peking University's Guanghua School of Management concluded that, by the end of 2017, the switch from coal to natural gas and electricity in the Beijing area was successful in nearly eliminating the sulfur dioxide pollution from coal, but little progress had been made against nitrogen oxides. Chen Songxi, a professor at Guanghua, described the conclusions of a forthcoming publication: ""The move from coal to natural gas is reflected in the dramatic, roughly 50 percent, falls in sulfur dioxide levels throughout the region since 2013. This was true in highly industrialized towns as well as in Beijing. Beijing's level already reached single digits in 2016, in the summer and spring, which is very close to European cities. Liu Baoxian, deputy director of the Beijing Environmental Monitoring Center, said, ""The average annual concentration of sulfur dioxide saw a historical low of only 8 micrograms per cubic meter""－far below the national standard of 60. On the other hand, Chen said, ""The other component of PM2.5 is nitrogen oxides, mostly from car emissions. We have seen little change in it. The other thing we see in the region is that the ozone level has been going up significantly. The number of cars in Beijing has pretty much leveled off but is not being decreased."",The winter of 2017 was a perfect storm for natural gas. For example, gas shipments from Turkmenistan fell by 32 percent from September to November, which could not be made up by volume from Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, according to China's customs authority. In addition, a large Sinopec liquefied natural gas terminal in Tianjin did not become ready for commercial shipments until this month. Domestic production of natural gas increased by 10.5 percent, while imports made up the difference, growing by 28.9 percent. As of 2016, China's gas came from 60 percent domestic production and 40 percent imports, but the central government expects imports to grow to 50 percent by 2020. Imports consist of liquid natural gas, imported by ship, and pipelines, currently mostly from Central Asian countries. A new pipeline from Russia is expected to bring natural gas to Northeast China and to Shanghai by 2020. However, LNG is abundantly available and can provide flexible supply－especially once receiving terminals and underground storage capacity are completed. In 2017, LNG took a bigger share of the imports. China imported 68 million metric tons in 2017－of which 38 million tons was LNG and 30 million tons was from pipelines. The previous year, the total was 54 million tons, of which 26 million tons was LNG and 27 million tons from pipelines, according to Meidan, of Energy Aspects. China's LNG imports surpassed those of South Korea to become the world's second-largest after Japan. According to Marc Howson, director of the LNG market at S&P Global Platts, a further increase to 50 million metric tons is expected in 2018. Australia is the major supplier, followed by Qatar, Malaysia, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. The US Energy Information Agency estimates that China has huge supplies of unconventional shale gas, about equal to those of the US and Canada combined. However, extraction of that gas is still in the early stages. ""Sinopec is developing shale with quite good results in Chongqing, producing 5 billion to 7 billion cubic meters of gas, quite a good accomplishment,"" said Meidan. ""However, the geology is still unclear, and therefore the technological needs and the pricing environment are all open questions. Even the US shale revolution that essentially took off in 2000 and reached a dramatic increase in output within five years was almost 20 years in the making－thousands of wells had been drilled by private firms, backed by various government incentive schemes. And when shale took off, natural gas prices were high enough to sustain development efforts."" Natural gas use is expected to grow to 10 percent of China's total energy mix, up from around 7 percent now. Combined with an even stronger emphasis on anti-pollution enforcement, it will be a key component of a cleaner mix of energy use and upgraded industry. Emphasizing that air pollution control doesn't conflict with the effort of developing the economy and improving people's lives, Wang Guoqing, spokesman for the first session of 13th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said: ""Development with high emissions and pollution affects not only long-term economic development, but also people's health. That is not the development we want."""
1,"Beijing, China's capital, holds first place as 2017's best tourist city on the Chinese mainland, according to a ranking list issued by jiemian.com and Toutiao. Beijing is followed by Chongqing, the mountainous city in Southwest China, and Shanghai, the country's economic center, respectively. The list is based on the evaluation of five factors: number of visitors, income made from tourism, relevant facilities, tourism's contribution to local economy, and traffic conditions. The top 10 tourist cities are as follows: No 1 Beijing   No 7 Wuhan,No 3 Shanghai,No 2 Chongqing"
1,"With China dedicated to greater opening-up for win-win cooperation, top executives of foreign companies have praised the nation for further expanding access to its enormous domestic market, and expressed optimism toward closer partnerships in the country. Speaking on Saturday at the ongoing China Development Forum in Beijing, Tim Cook, CEO of Apple Inc, said openness is essential in forming partnerships, and thanked China for opening its domestic market to his company. ""One of the key elements of partnership is openness - being open to working together, open to new ideas, open to new solutions. We have seen China continue to change and evolve, and we are grateful that you have opened your doors and allowed us to be a part of the community here,"" he said. Quoting a Chinese saying - ""The fire burns higher when everyone brings wood"" - Cook called for increased joint efforts from governments, educational institutions and businesses to address challenges such as poverty, inequality and climate change. ""We encourage China to continue to open up. We see that as essential - not only for China to reach its full potential, but for the global economy as a whole to thrive,"" he said. Cook's comments come as China steps up efforts to create a level playing field and a world-class business environment for all players. Last year, the country announced a string of policies to remove the cap on overseas ownership of joint ventures in the automotive and other sectors. Earlier this month, the Foreign Investment Law - aimed at better protecting the rights of foreign investors - was approved. It is scheduled to take effect on Jan 1. Dieter Zetsche, chairman of German automaker Daimler AG, said: ""Over the years, I've witnessed great development and changes in China's society, economy and, of course, in its automotive industry. This is a reflection of the great achievements China has made since reform and opening-up started."" He added that the country boasts his company's youngest customer base, which is very open to new ideas and innovative technologies. Zetsche said Daimler remains confident in and committed to the long-term development of China's economy. ""We will continue to help shape the transformation of mobility in the country,"" he said. Also on Saturday, Han Wenxiu, an official at the Central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission, highlighted China's determination to make the economic pie bigger and to share it better through openness and cooperation, instead of pursuing a zero-sum game. The country will continue to shorten the negative list to open up more sectors and ensure national treatment for foreign investors, and will step up legal protection of intellectual property rights and punishments for infringements, Han added. Sanjay Mehrotra, president and CEO of Micron Technology Inc, a memory-chip giant from the United States, said he was very pleased to see the efforts China has made to better protect foreign investments and intellectual property rights. ""This is very encouraging for China and for the whole world,"" he said. ""Innovation is encouraged and unleashed when there is an open market and free trade and intellectual property is respected."" He added that China has tremendous opportunities in the fields of artificial intelligence and fifth-generation wireless technology because the country has the right skills and a large market of new solutions that can be subject to experiments among the large population and fine-tuned on an ongoing basis. In addition to consumer-oriented companies that have benefited from reform and opening-up in the past four decades, foreign businesses that serve Chinese companies are also seeing big opportunities as a result of China's efforts to shorten the negative list and open more sectors to foreign capital. Martin Lundstedt, president and CEO of Volvo Group, said all the developments provide foreign companies with more choices when investing in China. Having been in China for more than 20 years, the Swedish manufacturer of vehicles, engines and construction equipment hopes to better tap into the country's booming e-commerce sector, and sees more opportunities resulting from the government's growing emphasis on green initiatives, sustainable development and innovation, he added."
1,"When the Shenzhen special economic zone was established, the city had about 300,000 residents. Those with educations above secondary school numbered only 4,000. Forty years after the launch of China's reform and opening-up, the metropolis is home to more than 5 million workers officially designated as high-level talent, as well as 100,000 professionals who have returned from overseas. Pursuing and treasuring skilled technicians and R&D talent has played - and will continue to play - an essential role in the reform pioneer's success, observers say. Cheng Yimu came to Shenzhen in 1991 to pursue his dream after giving up his ""iron rice bowl"", a term referring to job security. Cheng had a position in Beijing at a national authority over the mechanical and electronics industries. ""Since the late 1980s, many of my colleagues went to Shenzhen believing in its huge potential,"" Cheng said. Asked if he was sure about the transfer before his hukou, or household registration, was stamped, he said, ""Just do it."" In the city, he is part of the founding team of the Huaqiang North Electronics Market, one of the country's best-known electronics hubs. The emerging opportunity was a result of a local move to recruit talent nationwide, one of the first in the country, to China's Silicon Valley. Top workers flew south to take their chances at making a fortune, injecting added force into the thriving manufacturing industry. ""Talent and reform are complementary to each other,"" said Hu Gang, a professor at Jinan University's School of Public Administration. The large amount of talent swarming in provides strong momentum to drive Shenzhen's economic reform, he said. The need for top talent intensified a decade ago when local authorities launched a comprehensive high-level talent identification mechanism, one of the first in the country. It has been continually optimized over the years since. A series of preferential policies eased life for talented individuals, including financial support, housing subsidies, employment for spouses and education for children. As a result, more than 5.1 million highly talented people - mostly with a secondary school or higher education - had jumped aboard by the end of 2017. Meanwhile, Shenzhen's GDP grew to about 2.2 trillion yuan ($317.5 billion), the third-highest in China. What attracted them was not only preferential policies, said Chen Ning, who has a PhD in artificial intelligence. He returned to China from the United States under the Peacock Project, a program Shenzhen introduced in 2010 to attract overseas professionals. He said what he values the most is what the city provided for him to try out his startup's prototype product - a visual intelligence system. Thanks to the successful pilot project, his product has now been launched in more than 20 cities."
1,"If you personify China's consumption upgrade, you could say she is striking a pose full of poise these days. And the posture, which seems to herald glad tidings for high-end lifestyle, wellness and fitness businesses, is in full evidence at lucrative yoga studios that are mushrooming across China, industry insiders said. Two figures illustrate well the evolution of consumption upgrade: China's per-capita consumer expenditure reached 18,322 yuan ($2,667) in 2017, up 5.4 percent year-on-year. And consumers such as Christina Zhang, 25, a Beijing-based housewife, are more than willing to part with 15,000 yuan or more for an annual membership at high-end yoga studios. ""Yoga"" is Sanskrit for union－of body, mind and spirit, and well-heeled Chinese are pulling out all the stops to achieve that, egged on by new-age wellness startups that offer a variety of services and a range of yoga disciplines. For Zhang, a typical weekday afternoon is marked by an hour-long session at a high-end Bikram Yoga studio in downtown Beijing. The class sees her stretching herself in a variety of postures called asanas. As the inventive poses gradually wring sweat out of her shapely, supple frame, she disappears for a quick shower, and emerges from it radiating beauty that seems to arise from an equanimous mind anchored in a contented soul. Zhang reenergizes herself with some pastry, washing it down with a cup of refreshing black tea, while allowing her mind to float with the soothing soft music flowing out of invisible hi-fi speakers embedded in the studio walls. ""I think what I get here is worth the price,"" Zhang said. Her 15,000 yuan per annum membership contrasts with around 2,000 yuan yearly fee at traditional gyms that also offer yoga classes. But exclusive yoga studios offer a quieter environment and professional, experienced instructors. And rising demand for such exclusive services and high-end products is a clear sign that China's consumption upgrade is gathering steam, experts said. That steam is propelling new businesses such as Pure Yoga, a high-end yoga center that opened shop at WF Central, a premium shopping mall in Beijing, on Aug 5. Pure Yoga is operated by Pure Group, a Hong Kong-based owner of a popular lifestyle brand. The Beijing studio is the group's third venture on the Chinese mainland. Spread over 12,000 square meters and well decorated, the Beijing studio adheres to Pure Yoga's aesthetic style and incorporates unique natural elements that inform its design philosophy. The eco-friendly materials, including sustainable bamboo flooring, non-volatile paint, latest lighting devices, as well as the cutting-edge air-and water-purification systems, appear to create an oasis amid the concrete jungle. ""With world-class facilities and thoughtful use of space, Pure Yoga inspires people of all ages and abilities to make yoga part of their lives and enjoy the best yoga experience in a pure and healthy environment. We want to offer busy urban residents a space to relax and reenergize their soul,"" said Connie Chou, business development manager of Pure Group. The studio in Beijing boasts four group yoga rooms and one private chamber. This layout offers room for private coaching. To make sure every student gets the best out of their yoga experience, the certified, experienced teachers offer all members more than 125 premium classes each week, covering more than 20 types of yoga. The facility also provides bilingual teaching assistance. ""Practising yoga with professional yoga instructors, and in such pleasant environment, I felt my body and soul relax,"" said a practitioner after a yoga class taught by Italian instructor Dario Calvaruso. Founded in 2002, Pure Group opened its first yoga studio in Hong Kong. Seeing growing demand in first-tier cities, the company marched into the Chinese mainland. Colin Grant, CEO of Pure Group, said, ""We mainly target medium-to high-income individuals in first-tier cities, such as bankers and lawyers."" He said people's sports-related consumption is growing continuously, and the consumption levels of Beijing and Shanghai are comparable to that of Hong Kong. ""People's income is going up. Plus, their mindsets have shifted to 'I want a healthier lifestyle'. In the past, they may have wanted to spend money on buying fancy clothes and shoes. But now, they want to eat healthier, buy sports apparel, and live healthier. People are prioritizing consumption related to health."" The company sees the rising demand on the mainland as a big opportunity. ""The percentage of the population having a gym card in first-tier cities on the mainland is 1 to 2 percent, while the figure for Hong Kong is roughly 5 percent. Therefore, huge opportunities lie on the mainland. We aim at increasing our penetration rate in first-tier cities such as Beijing and Shanghai,"" Grant said. Agreed Qu Jing, a sports analyst at Beijing-based market research consultancy Analysys. ""High-end yoga can be viewed as the upgraded version of the normal one, and demand for that can be seen in the increase in the number of studios.,The proficiency level of the instructors is also higher. Apart from exercise itself, high-end yoga facilities offer social attribution and multiple consumption scenarios. ""For instance, they sell light meals, and develop member activities, to target high-end consumers, who are fond of novelty and have time and money to consume. As the fitness market expands, the competition becomes fierce. Therefore, the high-end market has to find ways to grab consumers."" Currently, Pure Yoga's annual membership cards sell for 11,888 yuan each. The company claimed strong growth in sales revenue in recent months. The 15-year-old studio in Hong Kong, its oldest, notches up 8 to 9 percent annual growth rate, which is a satisfying score, the company said. By August, it owned 23 yoga studios in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Beijing, Taipei, Singapore and New York, all of which record 10,000 visits per day. Despite claiming impressive results, the company said it does not want to expand too fast. ""As a premium brand, it is not about quantity. It is about quality. Slow and steady wins the race,"" Grant said. According to a report from the Economist Intelligence Unit, China's domestic annual personal consumption scale has surpassed $4 trillion, and the figure will reach $13.7 trillion by 2030. ""It's obvious that people's consumption level is transitioning to a medium-to-high-end sectors. Development-type consumption and enjoyment consumption will experience rapid growth,"" said Xing Zhihong, spokesperson of the National Bureau of Statistics, at a recent news conference. As noted by Beijing-headquartered think tank iyiou.com, those aged between 20 and 39, who constitute the core consumption group for the traditional sports industry, are the key to a promising future. Although this group is estimated to shrink by 25 percent in the coming 15 years, the growth rate of annual personal consumption will overweigh the decline. By 2030, Chinese people aged under 40 will surpass 300 million, with a steady growing consumption power. The EIU report forecast that by 2020, the median of domestic household annual income will reach $11,000, and $29,000 by 2030. As the elderly demographic grows, incomes of the working-age population will rise. As a result, their expenditure on health and fitness will go up. As people's spare time increases, they pay more attention to high-quality life, and are no more satisfied with traditional public sports. Instead, they turn to high-end sports, which offers them exercise while broadening their horizons, helping them to embrace a more sophisticated life."
0,"A team of 463 guardians has been recruited to monitor and help protect the Beijing section of the Great Wall, the city's cultural heritage authority said on Saturday. The guardians of the UNESCO World Heritage Site are villagers living along the wall. They conduct regular safety inspections of key wall sections and upload photos and descriptions of its condition via a phone app. Before the recruitment of the guardians, there was cause for concern about the protection of the Great Wall, said Yu Haikuan, deputy director of the heritage protection bureau in Beijing's Yanqing district. ""Most of the wild sections of the Great Wall are in an unattended state,"" Yu said. By the end of May, six suburban districts along the Great Wall had completed recruitment of 289 full-time workers and 174 part-time ones, said Ling Ming, deputy director of the Beijing Cultural Heritage Administration. Another 11 full-time workers will be recruited by 2022. According to a survey of the Great Wall's condition by the National Cultural Heritage Administration in 2018, sections with little and poor preservation accounted for about 41 percent of the Beijing section. Due to human destruction and natural weathering, some parts of the Great Wall are damaged or have collapsed, and are in urgent need of repair. ""The villager team assists us in some emergencies to send signals as early warning,"" said Yu. ""At the same time, they make up for the staff shortages on cultural relics protection."" In April, 128 villagers from Yanqing district underwent training and testing from Great Wall researchers for part-time positions. Apart from learning basic knowledge, they also mastered how to inspect and report hazardous conditions via a mobile phone app. Wang Dongzhu, a member of the team in Yanqing, said being a guardian provided a precious opportunity to protect a world heritage wonder. Starting in May, the 45-year-old spends three to four hours each weekday inspecting a 2.5-kilometer section of the wall in Yanqing district's Xiangying village. ""Even though I'm tired sometimes because of the long distance, I enjoy cleaning the environment of the Great Wall and telling visitors of the importance of protecting a world heritage relic,"" he said. Beijing is home to 520 kilometers of the Great Wall, which traverses 15 provinces and cities. Since 2000, the city has invested nearly 470 million yuan ($68 million) in 96 projects to protect the section, according to the Beijing municipal administration of cultural heritage."
1,"Beijing courts said they would intensify efforts to protect intellectual property rights, especially trademarks, after a rise of IP-related cases over the past year. In 2018 courts across the capital filed 59,094 IP civil and administrative disputes, up 43 percent year-on-year according to statistics released by the Beijing High People's Court on Wednesday. ""Of the total, several were new-type cases or those rarely appearing in previous IP case hearings, which brought challenges to our work,"" said Yang Boyong, chief judge of the court's No 3 Civil Division. Last year, for example, Beijing IP Court handled a trademark dispute about ""DiDiDiDiDiDi"" between Tencent Technology and the Trademark Review and Adjudication Board of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce. It is the country's first case concerning sound trademarks. After the hearing, the IP court gave a verdict in favor of Tencent, ruling that the sound ""DiDiDiDiDiDi"" designed by the company could be registered as a trademark to use. ""It could be a new step for us in identifying trademarks and protecting trademark rights,"" Yang said. To more effectively safeguard trademarks, the Beijing High People's Court also issued a guideline on hearing trademark-related civil and administrative cases on Wednesday. The guideline aims to push administrations to improve efficiency in reviewing trademarks and gives more protection to legitimate trademarks by preventing people who register trademarks with ""malicious intent"". In recent years, the practice by some individuals and companies to register popular names as trademarks has disrupted the market and eroded trust according to Pan Wei, a judicial official of the high people's court. What the registrants want is to gain profit by transferring registered trademarks at a high price or ask for compensation, she said. ""To encourage trust in business and keep the market in order, the guideline clarifies registrants who cannot give a clear explanation on the use of their registered trademarks will face restrictions,"" she added. Yang said Beijing courts would further protect technological innovations by improving quality of case hearings, and increase communication with IP-related administrations by holding seminars and conducting research. ""In addition, we'll regulate behaviors of governmental departments in handling IP-related affairs by sending them judicial suggestions in a timely manner to better guide them in IP protection,"" he added."
1,"Artificial intelligence (AI) and other new technologies are keywords highlighted in exhibition section of cultural and tourism enterprises at the China International Import Expo as Chinese museums and cultural institutions tap into new technologies to preserve their artifacts and promote them to global audiences. ""Technological innovation and cultural creation are like 'wings of a bird' for the development of cultural industries,"" said Yu Qun, a senior official from the China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism, during a forum themed Synergy and Intersection: Summit on Culture+Technology on Nov 7. The extensive use of innovative technologies such as internet, big data, 3D printing and intelligent manufacturing have introduced new products, business models and activities in the cultural industry, he said. Shan Jixiang, director of the Palace Museum Beijing, spoke about how new technologies and innovative ideas helped the museum, one of the most popular in the world, to continuously expand its display and exhibition space, while attracting new audiences on digital media. Palace Museum Beijing received 16.7 million visitors last year, about twice the number of the Louvre in France. Its official website received 891 million page views, Shan said. The museum has also launched a wide range of mobile applications, introducing its artifacts as well as Chinese history and culture to the public. Together with partners such as the Google Arts & Culture, Palace Museum Beijing has made 1.86 million artifacts accessible on the internet, and created VR experiences and interactive games that enable people to ""live"" in the Forbidden City. Licensed products from the museum have achieved a total sales volume of 1 billion yuan, Shan said. Google launched the Arts & Culture initiative in 2011, aiming at making the world's culture accessible to anyone, anywhere for free, said Ben Wong, chief marketing officer of Google Greater China. In China Google Arts & Culture has worked with Palace Museum Beijing, the Central Academy of Fine Arts, as well as cities such as Yangzhou, Jiangsu province, to promote their collection, culture and relics with new technology. Google has brought to the CIIE an interactive shadow play experience, where visitor's hand postures are projected on a screen and captured by AI, to become the character of a shadow puppetry show. Cultural and tourism enterprises are exhibiting in 4,000-square-meter area at the expo and feature more than 80 companies from 21 countries and regions."
0,"BEIJING - Beijing has raised the standards for private education institutions. In a standard released by the Beijing Municipal Education Commission, authorities have banned private education institutions from conducting classes in underground areas or residential buildings. Private institutions are not allowed to change teaching venues or expand branches or training areas without authorization. According to the standard, the teaching venues of private education institutions must be more than 300 square meters. Teachers in Chinese, math, English, physics, chemistry, and biology are required to have teacher's certificates, and their names, photos, class numbers and certificate numbers should be displayed in ""obvious areas"" in the teaching venues.

The district has made sound preparations for an expected 16 million tourists who will visit in the next 162 days, with work done in the fields of travel, tasting, residences, retail and entertainment. Yanqing has renovated nine roads, 36 residential communities, more than 50 villages and eight towns around the exhibition site, and also built lighting projects over nightscapes to improve the sightseeing environment. He Haijun, deputy director of the Yanqing district commission of urban management, said local authorities have arranged 2.6 million potted plants and flowers in more than 10 types, setting up nine large flower terraces on main streets. Tourists can even enjoy the blooming flowers during their journey to the exhibition site, conveying a festive happy atmosphere, He said. Along with building and rebuilding roads linked to the exhibition site, Beijing authorities have arranged to add trains and buses to ease traffic pressure between downtown Beijing and Yanqing. A 42.2-kilometer expressway linking Beijing's northwestern Sixth Ring Road and Yanqing district was put into operation early this year, helping break a transportation bottleneck. Beijing's suburban S2 rail line will add more trains during the event, and nonstop trains have also been arranged. More bus routes and buses will be added, such as eight new bus routes running from downtown Beijing to the exhibition site and four regional bus routes to start operation in the district. In March, Yanqing launched a smart traffic system integrating intelligent traffic management and big data platforms for traffic services, according to Li Minwei, deputy director of the Yanqing district transport bureau. The system includes 222 cameras to supervise the road network, and LED screens to continuously share information on road conditions. The big data platform could summarize the traffic situations of the road network at peak periods, helping authorities prepare personnel to guide traffic on the spot and prevent and reduce illegal behavior. Li said 10 parking lots have been built around the site to deal with traffic spikes, adding 22,000 parking spaces. A traffic sign system and supporting service facilities have already been built and are in testing at the site. Yanqing has upgraded catering services to satisfy differentiated demands for food. Within 8 kilometers around the site there are 22,000 dining seats, and within 5 kilometers there are 301 catering units. For accommodation, there are 615 hotels offering 24,000 beds. The district also prepared a batch of ""middle- and high-end"" homestays, numbering around 200, to boost housing resources and made ready to receive global visitors. Other popular existing homestays are ready to offer services, such as Shiguang Great Wall Boutique Hostel and Shanzha Courtyard, said Zheng Aijuan, deputy director of Yanqing's tourism commission, and 35 high-end homestays are offering 2,500 beds. Tourists can get help from mobile apps and smart programs provided by an intelligent service system.

1,"China and the United States will continue trade talks even though it will take long-term efforts to solve the complex issue of bilateral trade, experts said on Tuesday. The comments came after US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross concluded a series of meetings in Beijing with Chinese officials as part of ongoing trade discussions. The meetings focused on reducing the US trade deficit by facilitating the supply of agricultural and energy products to meet China's growing consumption needs, which will help support growth and employment in the US, the White House said in a statement released on Monday. China said if the US introduces trade sanctions, including tariff increases, the economic and trade achievements negotiated by the two sides will not take effect, following the third round of high-level official talks concluded on Sunday. Justin Yifu Lin, former chief economist and senior vice-president of the World Bank from 2008 to 2012, said trade, in essence, has ""economic rationality"". Even if China's economic development caught up with the US, the bilateral trade would remain beneficial to each other. At that time, the US would gain more from that. With regard to recent trade talks, Lin, now a professor at Peking University, said the main cause behind the widening US trade deficit lay within the country itself, where people ""consume too much while saving only a bit. ""Since the 1950s, the US began to transfer its labor-intensive industries to Japan, and the latter then transferred these sectors to other Southeast Asian economies,"" Lin said. ""The industrial transfer leads to China's trade surplus with the US ... It is unfair to blame China."" Robert Carnell, chief economist and head of research for Asia Pacific at ING Group, said that China's moves in the past weeks have made it clear that it has no interest in a trade war. ""Despite some apparent progress in weekend talks on the bilateral Sino-US trade deficit, Trump's revival of a plan to impose $50 billion of tariffs on Chinese goods has turned these negotiations on their head once more,"" Carnell said in a research note. ""Trump will meet an angry and emotional group at the G7 meetings in Quebec this Friday... I suspect there will be little sympathy for Trump unless he has a change of mind (again)."" Carnell said the current trade situation suggests that the legal framework of the World Trade Organization that has served the world trade for so long is crumbling. Tu Xinquan, director of the China Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International Business and Economics, said China should be prepared for increasing unpredictability and uncertainty in the moves of the Trump administration. ""It is a rare phenomenon that the US is not only having trade disputes with China but also with its allies in the European Union and North America. It appears that the US is challenging the international trade system which it led in building after World War II,"" he said. Tu said the US policies have brought more uncertainties to the existing international trade order. China should be prepared for all kinds of outcomes, including the possibility of the US withdrawing from the WTO. Contact the writers at zhongnan@chinadaily.com.cn"

The producer of the vehicle, China Youngman Automobile Group Co, was quoted as saying the engine can convert water into hydrogen, which in turn generates electricity to drive the vehicle, but it didn't reveal the exact process involved. ""It is not a theory,"" Pang Qingnian, the company's chairman, told Xinhua News Agency last week. ""We actually produced the car and it is running. We want to launch it to the market next year. This is our goal."" The vehicle was the first prototype to apply the hydrogen generation technology and needs further improvement before being put into mass production, according to the administrative committee of Nanyang's high-tech zone, where China Youngman is located. After taking a test ride, the city's Party chief, Zhang Wenshen, called it ""very good"" in a news report on Thursday. The administrative committee said the project, which was approved by the Ministry of Science and Technology in 2010, produced technology that has been patented and is supported by Hubei University of Technology. But media reports about the ""water-fueled"" vehicle soon sparked skepticism online, as scientists and industry experts said that simply turning water into hydrogen, even with the help of catalysts, contradicted the law of conservation of energy in physics and chemistry. ""Converting pure water into hydrogen as fuel is as impossible as turning water into oil,"" Sun Baigang, a professor at Beijing Institute of Technology's School of Mechanical Engineering, told The Beijing News. He said making hydrogen out of water can only be achieved by adding other chemicals, including methanol, sodium borohydride, magnesium or aluminum powder. These are all existing technologies and are not considered new in the industry, he said. Staff members at the local industry and information technology bureau told The Beijing News on Friday that the initial report released inaccurate information that led to misunderstanding. The project was still under development and had not been put into production or approved by industrial authorities. According to the committee, the project has been under development by a team from Hubei University of Technology since 2006. The team started cooperating with the company two years ago to commercialize their scientific results. Dong Shijie, the project leader from the university, said the technology was misinterpreted and is not the same thing as a ""water-fueled engine"". ""Water is just a reactant. The core technology lies in the equipment, materials that produce hydrogen and the control systems. It is purely a misunderstanding that the vehicle only runs on water,"" he said. Liu Zhongmin, director of the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, a subsidiary of Chinese Academy of Sciences, said, ""The media report only emphasized the role of water but failed to give a full explanation. It is incomplete and misleading to simply introduce the concept of water."" Liu said if the technological process applied in the vehicle used aluminum, which reacts with water to make hydrogen, as explained by the committee, before generating power, then the principle seems more reasonable. He said the science behind hydrogen-fueled vehicles has already been done, but the actual cost and how to ensure safe use of hydrogen-considering its flammable and explosive nature-remains a big challenge to the future marketing of the product.

1,"Beijing's local government is encouraging private sector to participate in the construction and operation of snow venues for Winter Olympics, government officials said in a recent news conference. To prepare for the 2022 Games, Beijing plans to build a snow sport center with topnotch facilities, as well as Olympics and media villages in Yanqing district. According to Cheng Daqing, director of the Development and Reform Commission of Yanqing district, the running of snow venues and the construction of Olympics venues and media villages will adopt a public-private partnership (PPP) mode and welcome capital from the private sector. Cheng said such a mode will help cultivate winter sports companies and improve the underdeveloped industrial chain. ""By innovating in financing mechanism and encouraging private capital, advanced technology and management experience can be applied to the winter sports industry,"" Cheng said. ""The government can concentrate on their job in market-monitoring rather than taking part in the operation of capital."" Zhang Yuan, with the Party's standing committee of Yanqing district, said winter sports resorts usually are only profitable in the snow season, but the future resort in Yanqing is expected to maintain growth, serving as a holiday resort, training center and conference venue throughout the year. The 2.8 billion yuan ($422 million) project will open for tenders at the end of this year. According to the 2017 International Report on Snow & Mountain Tourism by Laurent Vanat, a senior industrial consultant, although China has seen continuous growth in the number of skiing resorts, there are only a few resorts and venues equipped with sufficient hospitality facilities and high-quality slopes. Li Na, a Beijing-based private ski club member, said the future snow venues will provide players closer resorts with better traffic connection, to help in their training. ""Currently, we usually go to Thaiwoo or Wanlong Ski Resort in Hebei province, and the hardest part is to coordinate just enough number of people to share the gas and drive,"" she said. ""Outskirts of Beijing also have some skiing centers but they are smaller in size with one or two artificial snow slopes."" Li added that hotel services near the skiing center in Beijing were not so satisfying, so members usually prefer not to stay for the night, even though a round trip in a day after skiing can be rather exhausting. ""I think if the venue in Yanqing were to have really nice hotels and top slopes, we would certainly love to go,"" Li said. The future venue is also the latest effort to fulfill the need of the emerging winter sports market, which has a trillion yuan profit potential. ""The number of winter sports players has grown from 8.05 million in 2014 to 11.33 million in 2016 at an annual growth rate of 18.6 percent,"" Zhang said. ""The growth in northern China is especially strong, which accounts for a third of the entire number."" He said the country has immense market potential in the snow-related industry, with more than 22 million tourists coming to Yanqing district every year, while the annual number of tourists visiting Beijing reaches 300 million. According to the General Administration of Sport of China, the number of ski resorts has increased to 646 in 2016 from 408 in 2013, while the number of skiers climbed to 11.33 million last year."
0,"Maksim Mrvica, a Croatian pianist has just premiered two singles in Beijing, New Silk Road and China Rhapsody  In 2001, Maksim Mrvica, a Croatian-born classical pianist studying in Paris, gained fame as a promising young musician after winning piano competitions in Europe. After watching his performance on TV that year, Tonci Huljic, a Croatian songwriter and producer, approached Mrvica and introduced him to Mel Bush, a concert promoter and music manager, who put on concerts for artists like Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, and Elton John.  At that time, Bush was looking for a classical pianist and hoping to break into the classical crossover market. On meeting Maksim, Bush was impressed by both his rock star image - tattoos, chic hairstyle - and solid piano playing technique.      Bush signed Mrvica on the spot after hearing him play just one piece.  Nearly two decades later, Mrvica, with 11 crossover albums since 2003, has grown into one of the top selling crossover pianists in the world.  His albums, including the hit one, Croatian Rhapsody, in 2015, have sold more than 4 million copies in 57 countries.  Meanwhile, the pianist has just premiered two singles in Beijing, New Silk Road and China Rhapsody, both written by Huljic.  To support of these releases, Mrvica will kick off a tour in China - his biggest one in the country - by visiting 34 cities, including Beijing, Nanjing, Hangzhou and Shenzhen.  ""I've performed over 100 shows in China and I want to give something back to my fans here. The two songs are inspired by China, especially Chinese culture,"" the pianist says in Beijing. Mrvica first came to China in 2008 to record a piece, Olympic Dream, for the Olympic Games in Beijing.  Since then, the pianist has toured China every year and has built a large fan base.  In 2016, he has visited 26 Chinese cities, playing his signature pieces, including an energetic version of Rimsky-Korsakov's Flight of the Bumblebee.  As for the two new songs, the New Silk Road, was recorded in Budapest along with more than 60 musicians from the Budapest Symphony Orchestra.  For the six-minute song, the composer, Huljic, combined music elements from China, Russia, India and Central Europe, including the sounds of Chinese instruments - the erhu and bamboo flute.  Speaking about his work, Huljic says: ""As composer, I collect music elements from all over the world. And I am very interested in Chinese music, especially ethnic music.  ""This is my first time in China and before composing these two songs, I asked myself 'How can I describe China in a few words?' Then I chose the words like 'great', 'wisdom' and 'humanity'. I put these words into music.""  Speaking about the songs, Huljic says that while New Silk Road is a grand and dazzling piece for piano and orchestra, China Rhapsody is just for piano.  ""China Rhapsody is much simpler technically. There are many kids in China learning piano and this piece is material for them to practice,"" he says.  Huljic also says that this year marks the 25th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and Croatia and he dedicates these two pieces to the two countries.  Giving details about his tour, Mrvica says that he will divide his upcoming visit China in 2018 into two seasons - spring and autumn.  ""The number of the cities (for the tour) is still growing, so I can take a short break between these two parts.  ""It (the tour) can be very exhausting. So, I usually stop playing the piano for a while after each segment so that I can recharge myself.""  Mrvica, 42, who was born in Sibenik, Croatia, started piano lessons at the age of 9 and by the age of 11, he had held his first concert as a soloist with an orchestra.  It was not easy for him to become a concert pianist, especially when, at the age of 15, war broke out in Croatia.  But he continued to practice his piano in the basement of his music school.  By that time he had won the first prize in a national competition in Zagreb.  Later on, he won the first prize at the Rubinstein Piano Competition in Paris and the first prize at the Pontoise Competition in France.  He then went on to study at the Music Academy in Zagreb before he spent a year at the Franz Liszt Conservatoire in Budapest.  His debut album, Gestures, was released in 1999.  The album, featuring works by contemporary Croatian composers, became one of the fastest-selling classical recordings released in Croatia.  Speaking about his musical journey, Mrvica says: ""No one in my family is a musician. So, when I told my parents that I wanted to become a pianist, they were very surprised.""  The pianist is recording a new album in London and Budapest, and it is scheduled to be released in January.  The two new pieces, New Silk Road and China Rhapsody, will be in the album, and for the first time, he will integrate pop music into his work.  ""In the new album, audiences will find familiar pop songs from Coldplay, John Legend and music from the popular TV drama, Game of Thrones. It's a challenge to adapt pop music into classical music but I like it,"" he says.  chennan@chinadaily.com.cn    (China Daily 10/28/2017 page19)"
0,"The contemporary dance work   is currently being staged in Beijing. The piece, led by Hua Xiaoyi, explores the identities of women.  Three choreographers are involved with the project, including well-known British dancer, Akram Khan. The production has gathered together top talent from around the world, including the UK, the Netherlands and South Korea. This is 25-year-old Hua Xiaoyi's first contemporary dance work. She has been practicing classical dance for 14 years, and has been honored twice for her skills on the stage. In her past works, she has portrayed a variety of roles.  But with this work, she wants to be herself.,""I think this is a breakthrough. I'm attempting to express myself through another language,"" she explained. ""The most difficult part is psychological, since I've practiced classical dance before. It's such a different dance language. This time, I want to give up the familiar things and accept a fresh challenge. This work expresses the theme of choice; we face choices in every moment through our life, it's precious."" A year ago, Hua initiated the   idea, which was supported by Xu Rui, vice president of the Beijing Dance Academy. Hua remembered how she was inspired by British dancer Akram Khan's abilities when she saw his show in New York in 2013. With Xu's help, Hua got in contact with Khan and invited him to choreograph in her show.,Xu, who shaped and helped finish the whole production, recalled time with the team.  ""Real meaning of this international team is inter-cultural cooperation. We have different culture backgrounds and we have different understanding. We encouraged and inspired by each other,"" Xu Rui said Consisting of four sections, the whole production was choreographed by Khan and Chinese artists Lou Menghan and Gao Chengming.,Menghan, who choreographed the third section, explained what he was trying to express.  ""My piece is roughly translated into dancing on my own. But you don't need to get the meaning only by the words. What I want to say is when we are alone as a dancer and this reflects to Xiaoyi, now with her, another step of her career. Always try something and challenge herself. I use different element, express in different moves."" The show will move to Shanghai on Nov. 21 and 22."
0,"An all-in-one card for taking public transport in Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei province will be available to all lines in the region by the end of the year, according to Beijing Municipal Commission of Transport. The card was put into operation in 2015 on an experimental basis on some lines. With the number of lines increasing, more than 800,000 copies of the card had been issued to passengers in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region by September. Passengers with the card can take all buses in downtown Beijing, certain lines in Tianjin and all lines in Hebei's Shijiazhuang, Cangzhou, Baoding, Handan, Zhangjiakou, Chengde and Langfang. They also can enjoy the same preferential policies, such as a discount for taking buses in a certain city with the city's own transport card. The all-in-one card also can be used in some other provinces, including East China's Jiangsu and Northeast China's Jilin. The aim is to make public transport more convenient and efficient for passengers, and thus promote the integrated development of transportation in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, the commission said."
0,"Excessive coal consumption, harmful gas discharges from chemical plants, and vehicle exhaust are the major causes of air pollution in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and neighboring areas, experts said in a report released on Sunday. The research was carried out by the National Joint Research Center on Air Pollution Causes and Control, and was based on more than a year of monitoring and analysis of PM2.5 in 28 cities including Beijing, Tianjin and other cities in Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong and Henan provinces. Chai Fahe, deputy director of the center, who oversaw the report, said excessive coal consumption is the most important cause, followed by gas emissions from heavy industry and vehicle exhaust. The report said that the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and neighboring areas consume a great deal of coal - quadruple the national average. Their production of steel, coke and glass accounts for more than 40 percent of the country's production. ""By analyzing the chemical components of air pollution in different cities, we can find out the sources of pollution and provide them with targeted solutions,"" Chai said. ""For example, the capital's major source of air pollution would be vehicle exhaust, and we recommend more use of electric vehicles."" Cities like Taiyuan, Changzhi and Jincheng in Shanxi province and Baoding, Hebei province, had heavier air pollution last autumn and winter because people and enterprises there used more bulk coal than others for heating. Gong Huiming, director of Energy Foundation China's transportation program, said air pollution caused by bulk coal use and vehicle emissions has become increasingly serious. ""It is necessary to promote clean energy substitutes for coal,"" he said. ""As for car exhaust, while ensuring emissions meet standards, the government should encourage the transport of goods by railway rather than highway to reduce air pollution."""
1,"The Chinese government said it is paying great attention to the development of intelligent connected vehicles and considers the sector a vital way to ease the burden on transportation, energy consumption and environmental pollution, a top official said. ""By 2020, the market scale of the country's intelligent connected vehicles sector is expected to exceed 100 billion yuan ($14.5 billion),"" said Minister of Industry and Information Technology Miao Wei at the World Intelligent Connected Vehicles Conference held in Beijing from Oct 18 to 21. ""A new era of the automobile industry is here,"" he said. ""The development of intelligent connected vehicles can drive the technological reform and upgrading of the automobile industry."" With the Chinese government fostering the development of intelligent connected vehicles, several cities have enacted laws and regulations for autonomous driving trials, including Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, Guangzhou and Shenzhen in Guangdong province, and Changchun in Jilin province. Chen Jining, mayor of Beijing, said the capital city has regarded the intelligent connected vehicles sector as one of the key development directions for advanced industry since last year, and has introduced special supportive policies to promote open road tests for self-driving vehicles. Beijing will commit itself to taking the lead in building the fifth-generation internet of vehicles to form a complete technological system of intelligent connected vehicles that meet the requirements of advanced autonomous driving, known as Level 4, said the white paper by the Beijing Commission of Economy and Information Technology, issued on the sidelines of the conference. A 50,000-hectare pilot zone will be established and over 2,000 kilometers of roads will be earmarked in Beijing for testing intelligent connected vehicles. By mid-October this year, Beijing had opened 44 road sections with a total length of 123 km for automakers to test their autonomous driving technology, according to the white paper. Chen said the intelligent connected vehicle industry, as a strategic development direction in the new era, is closely related to a wide range of industries. Therefore, its improvement requires joint efforts from all parties. China's major internet giants are already embracing the trend and betting big on the promising market.,Chinese search engine giant Baidu Inc has taken the lead in China to realize fully automatic driving under the mixed road conditions of urban roads, beltways and expressways, and has achieved mass production of the Apolong, China's first Level 4 fully self-driving mini bus. It plans to ship the buses to Japan early next year. Baidu has been engaged in the automobile industry since 2013. ""The Apollo project launched by Baidu in 2017 has become the world's largest intelligent driving environment,"" said Robin Li, chairman and CEO of Baidu. The Apollo intelligent driving system has attracted 129 eco-partners and over 10,000 developers to create products so far. Due to the open platform, many ""new species"" of autonomous driving have become involved, such as driverless trucks, unmanned delivery vehicles, unmanned sanitation cars and autonomous wheelchairs. Li said Baidu has pushed forward with a series of initiatives aimed at limiting unintended consequences from artificial intelligence, as the internet giant has taken safety and security as its first principles in the development of autonomous driving. E-commerce leader Alibaba Group Holding Ltd has been developing its own internet-connected vehicle technology. The technology giant collaborated with SAIC Motor Co and launched the internet-connected model, Roewe RX5, sparking a buying frenzy. Alibaba said it believes the development of intelligent connected vehicles should not be limited to the product itself, but expand the vision from the car to the road. ""It's worth thinking about whether smart cars can effectively use road resources,"" said Wang Jian, chairman of the Alibaba Group Technical Committee. ""The internet should be another form of infrastructure for cars, just as roads are."" Alibaba's plans for automatic driving run alongside its vehicle-road synergetic project, which sees autonomous vehicles driving in an information-based environment and obtaining required road environment information from the intelligent transportation system. Wang said technological progress is closely related to the optimization of urban resources. ""Only when the least physical resources are used to support the development of transportation, the era of intelligent connected vehicles will really begin,"" he said.,Underpinning that goal is Alibaba's acceleration into real-world testing of autonomous driving. The company announced in September that its driverless fleet had been granted test license plates by the authorities in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province. Another internet giant, Tencent Holdings Ltd, is not far behind. Currently, Tencent has signed strategic cooperation agreements with FAW, BMW, GAC, Changan and other automakers. Several models powered by Tencent's internet of vehicles system, AI in Car, are already on the market. Pony Ma, chairman and CEO of Tencent, said the company is designing a voice interaction system to help drivers safely send and receive messages, minimizing drivers' distractions while driving. ""Carmakers are the leaders of the intelligent connected vehicle industry, and Tencent's position is clearly as an 'assistant' to carmakers, which helps the automobile industry achieve transformation and upgrading,"" Ma said. ""No automotive enterprise can provide all the resources and capabilities required to produce an intelligent connected vehicle. The future of the automobile industry needs efforts from internet tech giants and traditional carmakers,"" he said. His comments were echoed among major Chinese carmakers. ""Traditional automobile enterprises and internet technology companies are naturally and strongly complementary,"" said Xu Heyi, chairman of Beijing Automotive Group Co, or BAIC Group. BAIC Group unveiled its five-year plan, which aims to equip all of its products with world-leading self-driving or intelligent connected technologies by 2020. ""BAIC should strengthen its industrial presence in high-performance sensors, controllers, computing platforms, automatic driving systems and high-precision maps,"" Xu said. The group will cooperate with world-leading electronics company Bosch, Chinese tech giant Baidu, Chinese voice technology firm iFlytek Co, and other tech firms to integrate high-quality resources across the globe and to build an open intelligent connected vehicle ecosystem, Xu said. BAIC is not the first carmaker that has decided to build such an open vehicle ecosystem. BYD Co Ltd has launched its own car app platform, D++. Using the platform, app developers can gain access to 66 control rights, 341 sensors and extensive vehicle data. ""We are the first car brand to open all sensors and controls,"" said Wang Chuanfu, chairman and president of BYD. ""It is also the first step in the process of establishing a fully open vehicle ecosystem."" The platform has already attracted dozens of partners, including Baidu with its self-driving Apollo system, online security company 360 Security Technology Inc, and AI specialist Horizon Robotics Inc."
0,"A program for young Sinologists is helping academics from all over the world gain a deeper understanding of the country. Xu Lin reports. At a workshop in Jingdezhen, Jiangxi province, Polina Tsoncheva is carefully pinching clay on a spinning potter's wheel, molding it into a plate. ""It's such an indelible memory! The city is world-famous for its pottery and ceramics, and I get to see the process of how Chinese craftsmen make them,"" says the assistant professor who teaches Chinese and translation at St. Cyril and St. Methodius University of Veliko Tarnovo, in Bulgaria. Tsoncheva was on a four-day field trip to Jiangxi's Jingdezhen, Wuyuan and Sanqing Mountain as part of a cultural experience. They visited old villages, ancient porcelain kiln sites and watched traditional operas. It was part of the recent three-week 2017 Visiting Program for Young Sinologists in Beijing, in which 27 Sinologists from 26 countries participated. With an average age of 36, their research fields include the Chinese language, history and politics. The Ministry of Culture and the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences co-founded the annual project in Beijing in 2014. This year, it was held in four cities－Beijing, Shanghai, Xi'an and Zhengzhou－with a total of 120 participants. ""Young Sinologists can not only enhance their academic level, but also explore Chinese culture and society,"" says Zhu Qi, deputy director of the international liaison department of the Ministry of Culture. ""It was the most wonderful three weeks, at least in my last 10 years,"" says Tsoncheva. ""After listening to the lectures given by Chinese scholars in Beijing, interesting ideas for my future research have come to my mind."" She wants to delve into the history of Tongwen Guan, or the School of Combined Learning. Founded in the late Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), the government school taught foreign languages and scientific subjects. In 1902, it was merged with the Imperial University of Peking, which is now Peking University. ""The school was established due to the demands of translators and interpreters. Studying foreign languages allows one to meet different people and learn about the culture, history and traditions of other countries,"" she says. She also wants to further her study tracing the earliest time when Chinese literature entered Bulgaria and how it influenced Bulgarian literature. She discovered that in the 19th century, poems by Tang Dynasty (618-907) poets, such as Li Bai and Du Fu, were translated into Bulgarian from Russian or German versions. ""They didn't know Chinese, but their translations capture the Chinese spirit,"" she says.,Many years ago, Bulgarians knew little about China and they had limited access to information about the country. Tsoncheva's parents, who were born in the middle of 20th century, never visited China but they have been interested in Chinese culture and read books about China. She recalls that when she first heard a Bulgarian speaking Chinese in university, it sounded different from any other language she had heard before. ""It was like a song. I liked it at once and from that time on I was determined to speak it at least as good as that,"" she says. After studying Chinese in Bulgaria for four years, she came to the Beijing Language and Culture University in 2001 for a one-year program to further her Chinese. ""China is changing rapidly. Thanks to globalization, we're learning from each other's cultures in a dynamic process that also changes us,"" she says. ""I'm trying to transfer my endless curiosity and love for China and the Chinese language to all my students, making them eager to learn more and expand their worldview."" Ana Jovanovic couldn't agree more. ""Every time I come to China, I see a lot of changes because China has made developments in every field,"" says Jovanovic, docent at the faculty of philology, University of Belgrade, Serbia. ""Many foreigners are interested in traditional Chinese art and music. In Serbia, there are more performances today by Chinese performers and music troupes (than years before). It's great to see these shows outside of China."" Jiangxi boasts various traditional operas, and during her stay in the province, she enjoyed an opera about the legend of the White Snake－a love story between a man and the spirit of a snake. ""It's amazing for us to see the local operas and know about the local culture via the field trip to villages,"" says Jovanovic, who has translated two books by Nobel Prize laureate Mo Yan into Serbian. According to her, from the 1950s to 1970s, Chinese novels, including works of Lu Xun (1881-1936), were translated from intermediate languages such as English and French. But starting from the 1980s, some Chinese novels were translated directly from Chinese.,Svetlana Kharchenkova, a lecturer from the Leiden University Institute for Area Studies, in the Netherlands, believes the Visiting Program for Young Sinologists is an excellent program for young scholars and PhD students. ""It's an intensive program with varied activities. It's important to interact with Chinese scholars who are in similar research areas. For example, we can read and discuss each other's work to develop further research,"" she says. She is now writing a book about the development of the contemporary Chinese art market. ""The market didn't exist about 30 years ago, but now it's flourishing. I'm interested in these questions－how the market and the institutions were established? How did the auction houses and galleries emerge?"" she says. The visit to Jingdezhen also gave her inspiration, as she visited the art zone and porcelain studios there. She also enjoyed climbing the Sanqing Mountain, because the picturesque views reminded her of the traditional Chinese painting about landscapes. ""Imagine if we lived here, we would have the inspiration to make beautiful artworks, too. No wonder China has such wonderful traditional culture,"" she says. She started to learn the Chinese language in 2000. Four years later, she made her first visit to China, studying Chinese at Peking University for a year. ""The internet was not so developed at that time. It was so much fun to meet Chinese people and see Chinese characters everywhere,"" she recalls. She worked in Beijing from 2006 to 2008, witnessing the fast development of the capital before the Olympic Games, such as the further construction of the subway and the Beijing National Stadium.,""The program allows China to market itself. It's like a melting pot of different cultures. Young Sinologists from all over the world come to see what's going on here, rather than read textbooks about it,"" says Tochukwu Innocent Okeke, a lecturer from the department of history and diplomatic studies at the University of Abuja, Nigeria. Like others, he appreciates the opportunity to interact with Chinese scholars, so they can get firsthand information about China. ""It helps me open my heart more so I can connect with China in a more profound way,"" he says. ""I'm happy about being able to read books in the library of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences because outside China it's not easy to find such a rich collection. I also met many professors and our talks have given me more insights about my research focus."" When he was pursuing his PhD several years ago in Wuhan, Hubei province, he found the history of China-Africa relations could be traced back at least to the early Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), when Emperor Yongle sent his admiral Zheng He on seven expeditions to the Indian and Pacific oceans. ""Now the visiting program has stirred my interest in the topic again. I want to know about the ancient relationship between China and Africa, especially during the Ming Dynasty. I want to know about Zheng's statecraft and diplomacy,"" he says. Like him, other young Sinologists also benefited greatly from talking to Chinese scholars. ""Chinese professors give me precious suggestions about my research on agriculture. I want to figure out what lessons African countries can learn from China. One of the challenges between China and Africa is that there is little research in the area,"" says Gedion Jalata from Ethiopia, the program manager for Africa-China Dialogue Platform at Oxfam International. ""Since reform and opening-up was launched in 1978, China has lifted more than 700 million people out of poverty. We're planning to have scholars and policymakers discuss this at our dialogue platform, so African countries can learn from China's experience to reduce poverty,"" he says.

0,"The reflection of a ring on a large mirror attracts groups of visitors, who take out their phones and click many photos that will later be shared on social media. Olafur Eliasson, who has created the artwork for his first show in Beijing, is getting used to Chinese audiences. At the Red Brick Art Museum in Beijing, the Icelandic-Danish artist is presenting more than 30 immersive installations, sculptures and paintings. At the opening of the show, entitled Unspeakable Openness of Things, on March 23, large crowds came to the museum. Eliasson says he wants people to enjoy his show through physical experience, such as feeling and smelling instead of only seeing it through phone cameras.,The 51-year-old is known for his use of such elements as lights, water, fog and shadow to create natural effects of waterfalls and rainbows. His installation Weather Project that recreated a sun at Tate Modern Museum in London reportedly attracted 2 million visitors within six months in 2003. ""I won't ban phones. I encourage people to put down their phones and feel my work in a more physical way. Go under the water and feel the rainbow,"" says Eliasson, referring to his large-scale installation Rainbow Assembly, a circular ""curtain of mist"" that has shimmering rainbows on its inward-facing side. The artist says, sometimes, he too takes photos of his own works first and shares them on Instagram. But he hopes viewers feel more and sense more. Tomorrow Resonator and Yesterday Resonator is an installation he has made for the Beijing show that uses optical instruments to create bands of colors on the walls. For instance, visitors can see blue but once they close their eyes, they will feel as if they'd just seen purple. ""It's like reading poetry. Read more and you will go deeper, instead of staying on the surface,"" he says.,Eliasson was born in Copenhagen and spent his holidays with family in Iceland in his teenage years, when he watched the northern lights, glaciers and polar days and nights. Lots of his work focuses on natural elements, exploring people's relationship with nature. He says his artworks are a kind of amplifier of nature to allow people to feel it in a detailed way. ""Lights, water－we always take these things for granted. My works allow people to reconsider their relationship with the world. ""When I was a child, I thought the world would look after me. But now I understand that I have to look after the world, which is being ruined by us,"" says Eliasson, adding that he cares about climate change. Yan Shijie, founder of the Red Brick Art Museum and a collector of Eliasson's artworks, says the artist cares about the environment and problems facing humans.,Yan started collecting Eliasson's works nearly a decade ago. He visited the artist's studio in Germany several times and was impressed by his work attitude. Eliasson takes advice from scientists, architects and engineers when working on his art projects. It took him two years to prepare for the Beijing show. The artist and his team, according to Yan, had set up a miniature space like the museum in Beijing to work on the show before it began. ""Many describe him as a 'scientist artist'. I think science is a kind of language for him to realize his artistic ideas,"" says Yan. While in Beijing, the artist carries around a solar-powered lamp to promote his social business Little Sun, a project to provide these lamps to people living in areas that have a shortage of electricity like Ethiopia. He hopes to attract more Chinese people by his art to join in the project to help those in need.,Talking about his involvement in social business, the career artist says his art is a kind of motivation to drive people's participation in issues like climate change and environmental protection.

0,"Beijing is set to strengthen regulation of the use of food additives by small-scale catering businesses to better ensure food safety and public health. The capital's lawmakers on Wednesday reviewed new articles for a draft regulation to standardize the use of food additives by small-scale catering businesses. The draft regulation, submitted to the Standing Committee of the Beijing Municipal People's Congress, the capital's top legislature, stipulates catering business practitioners, which frequently use the food additives, keep a log of food additive names, amounts, time used and staff. This record should be kept for at least two years. Notably, small catering business practitioners are prohibited from purchasing, storing and using food additives like nitrite salt, which are easily abused or misused, it said. Zou Weiping, vice chairman of the legal committee of the Beijing people's congress, said the misuse of food additives is a cause of food safety accidents. For example, nitrite, a common food additive for meat products, looks similar to edible salt and is easy to eat by mistake and misuse, Zou said. At the same time, nitrite can result in death, illustrating a need for strengthened control, she added. Generally speaking, the regulation is expected to have three reviews by the standing committee of the people's congress and will be finalized after that."

Through the company's VR technologies, participants in the community of Desheng Street in the Xicheng district of Beijing could vividly experience scenes, including the workings of a manned submersible in the deep sea. ""We endeavor to not only deliver our technologies to film, gaming and animation but also extend them to vertical areas, including education, medicine and science,"" said Wang Junyi, Party branch secretary of Noitom. ""It's one of the reasons why we cooperated with a local community this time, hoping to let more people have a better understanding of China's development since reform and opening-up through our cutting-edge technologies,"" added Liu. Noitom, founded in 2012, has provided advanced technologies and solutions to an array of films both at home and abroad, including Game of Thrones, Wolverine, Crazy Nian and Sword Master. Dai Ruoli, co-founder and chief technology officer of Noitom, said: ""Virtual reality has infinite possibilities in a variety of areas. We expect to bring a more creative immersive experience to help VR walk into everyone's life."" The Chinese VR industry has seen rapid development in the past years. Industrial data pointed out that the country's VR market has soared by 164 percent to 16 billion yuan ($2.5 billion) last year."
1,"Apple Inc on Sunday said that it has already recruited over 1,000 people in its four research and development centers in China, as part of the United States tech giant's broader push to better leverage local talents to grow its business. This marks the first time for Apple to disclose updates of its R&D centers in China after the company announced its plan of building R&D facilities in Beijing, Shenzhen, Shanghai and Suzhou more than two years ago. “We are continuing grow the scale of the four R&D centersin China and welcome more talents to join us,” Isabel Ge Mahe, managing director of China at Apple, said. Ge made the remarks on the sidelines of the China International Big Data Industry Expo 2019, which kicked off in Guiyang, Southwest China's Guizhou province, on Sunday. Apple said earlier it has committed to invest 3.5 billion yuan ($500 million) in these R&D centers, so as to better tap into China's talents in manufacturing, app development, design and other sectors. According to Ge, Apple has about 13,000 employees in China, and the construction of the company's first China data center in Guizhou province is going well, as scheduled. Apple's plan is to invest $1 billion in the new data center, which is in Guian New Area, Guiyang. It will be operated by Guizhou-Cloud Big Data Industry Co Ltd, a company owned by the Guizhou provincial government. The data center is scheduled to be put into use in 2020. Apple also is working hard to help more rural students in China access digital technologies. Last year, Apple said it would donate 25 million yuan to the China Development Research Foundation as part of its efforts to help students in the nation's less-developed areas. The money is used to support the foundation's digitalization program and help more than 300,000 students from kindergarten to middle school in less-developed areas find a way out of poverty."
1,"The upcoming merger between two State-owned building materials manufacturers－China National Building Materials Group Corp and China National Materials Group Corp－will give the new entity a clear edge, especially in the cement business, over other global peers, experts said on Wednesday. Their comments came after nine listed subsidiaries of the two building materials giants suspended trading on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges last week, raising speculation about further substantial actions to be taken in their merger, which was announced last year. According to a statement jointly released by the two companies last week, CNBM will acquire all shares of SINOMA. Once the deal is completed, Beijing-based CNBM will become China's largest nonmetal materials manufacturer, cement equipment and engineering service provider by production capacity, with total assets of more than 550 billion yuan ($84.32 billion) and 250,000 employees. ""Since their business is overlapped in the cement sector, the reorganization will help the two companies cut excess capacity and enhance research and development ability to develop other new building materials, preventing price wars in gaining orders for cement from overseas mar-kets,"" said Zhao Ying, a researcher at the institute of industrial economics of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing. CNBM's cement production capacity reached 409 million metric tons in the first half of this year, while SINOMA produced 112 million tons of cement. The merger talks of the two giant groups started last August, when the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission approved their merger to cut overcapacity and maintain competitiveness of the cement industry. CNBM is well known as a manufacturer of cement, glass, lightweight building materials and glass fiber, while SINOMA possesses core technologies and complete innovation systems for nonmetals. ""For these two groups, halting trading of all their listed subsidiaries signals the possibility of internal resources integration and mixed-ownership reform, such as employee stock ownership plan (that) might be prepared and conducted,"" said Shen Meng, director of boutique investment bank Chanson & Co. Li Jin, chief researcher at the China Enterprise Research Institute in Beijing, said: ""China will continue to reinforce the integration between similar businesses and take advantage of leading industry players."" The State Council released the guidelines on SOE mergers and acquisitions last July, calling on the enterprises to form a mechanism in which State assets can flow flexibly by way of merger and acquisition, innovation, reducing capacity, and dealing with inefficient capital."
0,"Vivien Zhang's first solo exhibition in China, Codescape, is intended to inspire discussion among the generation born in the 1990s, who've grown up amid rapid technological development. The 27-year-old Beijing native, who was listed on Forbes' 30 Under 30-Asia-the Arts 2017, left China after the fifth grade. She spent the rest of her childhood in Nairobi and Bangkok, before attending university in London, where she earned her master's degree. Codescape is on show at Beijing's Long March Space through Oct 28. Forbes describes Zhang's oil paintings as ""intricate"". They employ colorful patterns to convey her ideas about geographical fluidity, science, math and philosophy. ""I started to develop a love for painting in childhood,"" she says. ""I didn't have formal training as a kid. But I've never stopped painting since. If it stops bringing me joy, then I'll focus on something else."" She recalls struggling in her early days in London. Initially, her studio there was a tiny, unheated room with a single, glazed window.,Zhang would often stare at an ultrasonic mouse-repellent device affixed to the ceiling. This allowed her thoughts to flow freely. ""That time reminded me that humans are strong and adaptable animals. We can endure a lot for the lives we seek,"" she says. She also had to grapple with cultural challenges in London. Zhang says her works aren't political. But she does aspire to challenge how people view art and culture, especially in their non-Western manifestations. Her multicultural background not only endowed her with a unique perspective on her surroundings but also showed her that being an artist didn't excuse her from her responsibilities as a global citizen and a person of Chinese origin.,""You face many challenges as a Chinese person living abroad,"" she says. ""My location at the intersection of cultures guides my creativity. And creativity is how I have a conversation with myself."" She constantly seeks to engage traditional Chinese culture, since she has spent most of her life away from it. So, she builds on the emotional and epistemological roots of such traditional symbols as ancient bronze ware and temples. ""It's normal and 100 percent OK that viewers from different cultures aren't aware of the symbols I use,"" she says. ""It makes me want to use them more, to tempt them to want to understand the cultures I come from."""
0,"China's new bullet train models with the name Fuxing - meaning rejuvenation - emblazoned on the outside of the cars were officially launched on the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway line on Monday.  A CR400AF model departed from Beijing South Railway Station at 11:05 am and headed to Shanghai, as a CR400BF model left Shanghai Hongqiao Railway Station for Beijing.  The new models typically travel at speeds of around 350 kilometers per hour but are capable of reaching 400 km/h.  It took the first train from Beijing about 5 hours and 45 minutes to reach Shanghai. On the way, it stopped 10 times, including at stations in Jinan, Shandong province, and Tianjin.  The line was chosen for the new bullet train models because it has been one of China's busiest railways, averaging about 505,000 passenger trips daily, according to China Railway Corp, the State-owned rail operator that led the design of the new models.  Liang Zhaoyu, spokesman for the company, said all the tickets for the first run using the new equipment from Beijing were sold out on Monday. The price was the same as for the existing high-speed routes between the two cities.  He said there would be two pairs of high-speed trains running between Beijing and Shanghai using the new Chinese-standard bullet train through the end of this month. Starting July 1, four pairs of high-speed trains operated between the two stations will include the new standard equipment.  The height of the new models was raised to 4.05 meters from 3.70 m - the same height as the existing bullet trains - while power consumption was reduced by 17 percent, said Lu Yang, chief researcher at the China Academy of Railway Sciences.  He said the new models have a powerful safety monitoring system with more than 2,500 sensors - 500 more than on existing high-speed trains.  ""The sensors are like eyes, monitoring the state of the train - whether it's the operational situation, the temperature of the bearings, the brake system or the compartment environment - at all times to ensure safety,"" he said.  If something goes wrong, the monitoring system will sound an alarm automatically and could take automatic measures, such as reducing the speed or even stopping the train, Lu said.  Apart from larger, more comfortable spaces for passengers, the new models have some other passenger-friendly features, such as better-placed chargers.  Richard Herzfelder, an agriculture specialist from the United States who has worked in China for more than 10 years and often travels on high-speed trains, said he found it more convenient to use chargers.  Previously, charging stations for phones or computers were often found below the seats. On the new bullet trains, they are located near the armrests. Herzfelder said he appreciated the change, as he no longer needs to stoop to charge his electronic devices."
0,"The Beijing Cultural Investment Think Tank Platform was launched in Beijing last month to boost cultural cooperation between China and the United States. The platform will offer support to cultural development by providing industry reports, big data and experiences from ongoing cultural projects, according to the organizers. The platform is a joint effort of Shanghai Jiao Tong University's Research Institute of Urban Science, a science research center in Beijing and the US Digital Entertainment Group, among others. ""We would offer more trend analysis in our reports rather than regional analysis to help businesses determine development directions in the years to come,"" Amy Jo Smith, president of the US Digital Entertainment Group, said at the 2018 Global Cultural and Creative Industry Partner Conference, where the platform was announced. The four-day meeting covered seminars and discussions on film, animation, performance and intellectual property, and participants discussed cooperation models for the culture industry. A competition was also initiated that would foster a talented team of musicians. The idea is to give training to talent through the competition, and then introduce music from Tennessee to the Chinese mainland, says Liu Linna, executive director of the Chinese office with Tennessee China Development Center. ""It's our expectation to truly push forward international high-end development of the Chinese music industry,"" Liu says. The meeting was held as part of China's efforts to boost cooperation in the international cultural and creative industry. The added value of culture and related industries hit 3.54 trillion yuan ($515.5 billion) in China last year, accounting for 4.29 percent of the GDP, says Li Yong, an official with the Ministry of Commerce's investment promotion agency. Li says since its establishment, the agency has signed 88 cooperation memorandums on bilateral investment promotion with 51 countries and regions, and is developing a cross-border cooperation platform for themed industries. Beijing has also taken a lead in cultural industry development. A series of policies, including encouraging the use of old factories to build cultural spaces and the development of brick-and-mortar bookstores, have been launched to optimize a culture business environment in the capital, says Yu Junsheng, deputy secretary-general with the Beijing municipal government. Special zones for the cultural and creative industry have been established over the years. The Cultural Assets Supervision and Administration Office has set up an investment and financing system, which has helped to raise more than 10 billion yuan for culture enterprises, says its office director Zhao Lei. ""As long as investment institutes and platforms support cultural and creative industry development, we'll offer rewards and interest and rental discounts,"" Zhao says. Those efforts have seen Beijing's culture businesses rake in 567.2 billion yuan in the first seven months of the year, up 15.9 percent year-on-year, according to Yu. ""We're looking forward to having more culture programs and gaining experiences, from them,"" Yu says."
1,"BEIJING - A new form of theater, which can be watched on the big screen, is gaining favor among young Chinese audiences and enriching performing arts in China.  On Wednesday, a new season of theater live content, starting from July, was announced in Beijing, including 23 new titles from various theater live broadcasting projects from London, Moscow and Broadway.  This is added to a list of 23 productions that have already been screened in 21 cities across the Chinese mainland and Taiwan over the past two years, according to Beijing-based ATW Culture Media Ltd., the sole distributer of National Theatre Live (NT Live) in Greater China.  ""This is the third year we brought theater live to the China market and we have seen a tremendous increase in the number of viewers and the venues,"" said Li Congzhou, CEO of ATW Culture.  In 2009, the Royal National Theatre in London started its NT Live initiative, which broadcasts high-definition live performances of their productions to cinemas and arts venues around the world. The new form soon became a hit among theater lovers.  The project was officially introduced to China in 2015. Since then, 39 venues have joined the programme, attracting 150,000 viewers with more than 1,000 screenings.  The ticket price is set at 120 yuan ($17.6).  Chen Qiaoyi, a bank clerk in her twenties, has watched five NT live performances in Beijing. She first learned about it from a friend who really liked the British actor Tom Hiddleston, who featured in the first series of NT Live screenings in China.  ""I was more immersed in the play than I expected,"" Chen said. ""The shooting was great. Most plays come in small theater productions. This was shot from different angles. It maximizes what it feels like to be on the spot.""  Chen is typical of the current foreign theater audience in China. ATW Culture's Li identifies them as mainly between 20 to 35 years old, female and highly-educated, mostly fans of American and British television and film.  In recent years, China has caught the world's attention with its fast-growing entertainment industry and an increasingly sophisticated audience. Award-winning musical classics such as ""Avenue Q,"" ""Wicked"" and more experimental productions such as ""Sleep No More"" have all tested the China market.  In addition to new screenings, Wednesday also witnessed the launch of the First International Theatre Live Festival, which ATW Culture expects to play a role in promoting the new format to a wider audience.  ""Previously, the venues we worked with were mainly theaters. This time, we will work with cinema chains for the festival, hopefully to attract people other than theater goers,"" Li said.  He hopes more middle school students can start to appreciate theater live, to hone language skills and gain cultural knowledge.  As a new format of theater embracing modern technology, it also spurs upgrading in the performing arts scene in China.  According to Li, many venues were renovated or equipped with new devices to meet standards for high-definition screenings.  Chen suggested it was also a good way to raise awareness of Intellectual Property Rights among Chinese audiences, as it is easy to get access to pirated materials in China.  ""The price is a little high, but it is worth it. Spending for a theater experience is nothing different from spending money to buy a product you really like,"" she said."

1,"Editor's note: 2017 was witness to a series of remarkable events in China — from the all-important National Congress of the Communist Party of China to the introduction of the country's first general civil law, from the first domestically-produced large passenger plane to more high-speed rail networks. As the year draws to a close, let's look back at the biggest stories from 2017 and consider what they mean for China's future. The twice-a-decade National Congress of the Communist Party of China was held in October, laying out the blueprint for the country's development over the next five years and beyond. In the report delivered at the 19th CPC National Congress, General Secretary Xi Jinping said the principal contradiction facing China has evolved, as socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era. The principal contradiction the country now faces is one between unbalanced and inadequate development and the people's ever-growing needs for a better life. Previously, the principal contradiction was described as being between the ever-growing material and cultural needs of the people and backward social production. In the report, the CPC has also drawn up a two-stage development plan for the period from 2020 to the middle of the 21st century to transform China into a great, modern socialist country.,China launched its first cargo spacecraft in April on a mission to test technology designed for the nation's planned manned space station. The Tianzhou-1, China's first cargo spacecraft, docked with the orbiting Tiangong-2 space lab to supply fuel and other items. The mission allowed scientists to test in-orbit resupply technology, essential to running a manned space station. In the future, the Tianzhou series will be tasked with transporting supplies of fuel and other necessities to China's manned space station, construction of which is set to begin next year. With all the achievements China has made this year, we are confident the country will meet the target of building a moderately prosperous country by 2020 and move on to become a great modern socialist country by the middle of the 21st century. With that in mind, let's say goodbye to 2017 and get ready to embrace the new year.,As the opening chapter of China's first comprehensive civil code, the General Provisions of the Civil Law took effect Oct 1. The civil code, a dream of generations of Chinese legal professionals, is expected to better protect the property and personal rights and serve as an ""encyclopedia"" where people will be able to find answers if they encounter civil disputes. The civil code, scheduled to be introduced in 2020, would unify laws related to non-criminal and non-administrative areas of the legal framework under a single piece of legislation.,The First Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation was held in Beijing in May. As the highest-level meeting of its kind since the Belt and Road Initiative was proposed in 2013, the event attracted heads of state and government of 29 countries and representatives from 70 international organizations and 130 countries. At the forum, leaders pledged to build an open economy within the framework of the B&R Initiative and a list of more than 270 outcomes was formulated. The initiative, comprising an overland Silk Road Economic Belt and a 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road, envisions reviving and enhancing the ancient Silk Road trade routes to create infrastructure, trade and people-to-people links between Asia, Europe and Africa.,China's first domestically produced large passenger plane, the C919, completed its maiden flight in May, marking a crucial step for the nation to become a force in global aviation by building its own aircraft with homemade engines. The twin-engine C919 is for short and medium-haul flights. It has high aerodynamic efficiency, low operation and maintenance costs, low fuel consumption and low engine noise.,China announced it will establish the Xiongan New Area in Hebei province on April 1. The move is aimed at advancing coordinated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. Situated about 100 kilometers southwest of Beijing, Xiongan is another new area of national significance, following the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone and the Shanghai Pudong New Area. Called by President Xi a ""major historic and strategic decision"" that would be ""crucial for the millennium to come"", the move will help phase out functions from Beijing not directly related to the capital and explore a new model of optimized development in densely-populated areas.,This year marks the 90th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army. For the first time, a large-scale parade was staged as part of commemorations to mark the founding of the PLA. The parade was considered a review of the military reform Xi had masterminded and presided over since he assumed leadership of the CPC in 2012. Xi inaugurated reforms amid a high-profile anti-corruption campaign within the PLA in 2015. In the same year, he announced a 300,000-person cut in PLA troops and an implementation plan for command system reform. Since then, the PLA has made a profound change in structure and strategic thinking, getting closer to what Xi envisions as a leaner, more capable and world-class modern military.,China's high-speed rail network, the world's largest, has seen several important lines open this year, as well as the introduction of new-generation bullet trains. In July, a high-speed railway linking Baoji in northwestern Shaanxi province with Lanzhou, capital of neighboring Gansu province, was put into operation. The new route connects Northwest China to the national high-speed rail network. In December, the first high-speed line to pass through the Qinling Mountains — the dividing line between China's south and north — went into operation, connecting the two historic cities of Xi'an and Chengdu. Moreover, China's new generation bullet train   (rejuvenation), over which China has complete intellectual property rights, started running between Beijing and Shanghai in July.,China's first domestically developed aircraft carrier was launched in April. The ship is the largest and most sophisticated surface vessel China has ever built. It is expected to be commissioned in 2020, when it will become the flagship of China's naval vessels. Currently, the People's Liberation Army Navy operates a sole aircraft carrier,  originally a Soviet-era vessel and refitted in China.,July 1 marked the 20th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China and the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. President Xi visited Hong Kong for celebrations and attended the inauguration of the fifth-term government of the HKSAR. Xi reviewed the success of the ""one country, two systems"" principle — which allows Hong Kong to retain its capitalist system after the return — saying it offers a new way of thinking and a new formula for the international community in addressing similar issues."
0,"The official who is widely expected to become the country's new environmental minister highlighted China's continuous efforts in combating pollution in the air, water and soil at an international summit on Monday, World Environment Day.  Li Ganjie, 53, made his debut at the opening of the International Summit of New Environmental Protection Technology in Nanjing, capital of Jiangsu province.  Li was named Party chief of the Ministry of Environmental Protection on Wednesday, after his predecessor, Chen Jining, became Beijing's acting mayor. The Party post would make him a likely choice for the ministerial role.  Li highlighted the latest data from the ministry showing improvements, with 338 cities reporting an increase in days with good air quality and blue skies last year.  In those cities in 2016, 78.8 percent of the days had air quality better than the national standard, an average increase of 2.1 percentage points over 2015, the annual China Environmental Statement released on Monday showed.  Air quality is considered good when the index measuring various pollutants stands at 100 or less.  Seventy-four major cities that have been monitored and assessed using stricter air quality standards since 2013 also showed improvement. An average of 74.2 percent of days in 2016 had good air quality, 13.7 percentage points higher than the level in 2013, according to the annual statement.  ""The concentration of PM2.5 was lowered by 30 percent last year compared with the level in 2013,"" Li said. Fine particulate matter classified as PM2.5, with diameter of 2.5 microns, is particularly hazardous to human health.  But Li also conceded that there is a conflict between environmental protection and economic growth, and in many regions, the emission of pollutants is approaching or has exceeded the ability of the environment to disperse or otherwise mitigate its effects.  The ministry and the Jiangsu provincial government are jointly hosting the summit, which runs through Tuesday.  Li worked in the ministry for about 16 years and was vice-minister of environmental protection between 2008 and October, when he was named deputy Party chief of Hebei province.  An appointment as minister usually requires approval from the National People's Congress, the top legislative body. The next meeting of the body's standing committee is scheduled for late this month.  Chen's new post as acting Beijing mayor also has attracted attention, given the air pollution and other environmental issues that the capital faces.  ""In the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, tackling the pollution, especially air pollution, has become the priority, beyond other issues like traffic congestion, which could make it a priority for the new mayor as well as the new environment minister,"" said Ye Tanglin, a researcher in regional integration at the Capital University of Economics and Business.  The government has set a goal to lower the average PM2.5 concentration to 60 micrograms per cubic meter by the end of 2017 in Beijing. Last year, it was 73, making it a challenging goal, according to environment experts and the ministry.  Water pollution and water shortages in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region also will pose challenges for the new environmental minister, Ye said.  Dong Zhanfeng, deputy head of environmental policy department at the Chinese Academy for Environmental Planning, the ministry's think tank, said the severe water pollution, especially in the-Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, is a reality.  Dong said the ministry could do more in this regard, and more regional cooperation is needed to tackle pollution in bodies of water like the Haihe River, which runs through the region."

The forum, organized by the Mongolian embassy in Beijing, focused on the Belt and Road Initiative and the further enhancement of regional economy.  The freight train linking China, Mongolia and Russia will boost trade and regional economy, said Wang Jiayu, an official from the National Railway Administration of China.  China is developing the China Railway Express, also called the Sino-European freight train. The China Railway Express train has three routes: an eastern, central and western route. The central route links Mongolia and Russia and extends to other European countries. B. Tsogtgerel, Mongolian vice-minister of transportation, said the central path is very important. A total of 167 China Express Railway trains passed Mongolia last year.  ""The target is to increase it to 400 this year,"" he said.  ""Mongolia will continue to provide assistance to make sure the path is smooth, including further cutting time for trains to cross borders and clear customs. Mongolia will also provide more space for freight trains to load and unload goods."" Tsogtgerel said the Belt and Road Initiative, proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013, will boost regional economy.  ""The economic collaboration between China, Mongolia and Russia is an important part of the global economy,"" he added.  China started the China-Europe freight train service in 2011, and enhanced the service in 2013 under the initiative. Last year, 1,702 trains departed from China, a 109 percent year-on-year increase, and 572 trains returned to China, up 116 percent year-on-year, according to the China Railway Corp."

The forum, co-hosted by Yuelu Academy, ifeng.com, Dunhe Foundation and Particle Information, released a report, which indicates that content pertaining to  loosely defined as the study of ancient Chinese civilization, specifically, subjects such as history, philosophy, literature and art-is gaining popularity among young Chinese. By analyzing results from the big data system of the Particle Information app and a questionnaire from ifeng.com with 100,000 respondents, the report gives a rounded account of the age, gender, region and interests of people holding an interest in  The report delves into the group of   youth"", users aged under 36, who have subscribed to a   channel on the Particle Information app. Within this group, users born in the 1980s account for nearly half with a significant 48.46 percent, followed by those born in the 1990s, with 32.47 percent.,Though most are interested in traditional content, such as calligraphy,   (the Book of Changes) and ancient poetry, these young followers of traditional Chinese culture also subscribe to channels with modern characteristics, including films, technology and design. Gan Lu, general manager of the marketing center at Particle Information, says that the popularity of   among younger users is marked with a sense of modernity, as their passion for it is often presented in their preferred forms of entertainment. For instance, they choose TV shows, travel destinations and products that have rich cultural connotations. ""With the increasing popularity of   comes the prevalence of culture-related variety shows and the rise of the cultural and creative industries,"" Gan observes. ""It shows the subtle influence that traditional culture exerts on the values of contemporary youth."" Gong Pengcheng, director of the Cultural Resources Research Center at Peking University, says: ""We have known that fashion trends and entertainment consumption of today's young people bear the stamp of traditional culture. However, in our education system, guoxue has yet to be implemented."",According to Gong, modern education should draw from the benign conventions of traditional education and develop a general syllabus with emphases on classical literature, interpersonal skills and physical fitness. ""In order to rejuvenate our educational traditions, we should constantly reflect on our modes of teaching and incorporate into modern education the spirit and practices of traditional learning,"" Gong says. Yang Dongping, director of the 21st Century Education Research Institute, concurs with Gong in saying that traditions of ancient education should be inherited. ""Schools are the center of China's education,"" he notes. ""We should inherit the tradition of small-class teaching in order to provide humanitarian and individualized education."" Zhu Xiangfei, a visiting professor at Beijing Normal University, founded the Kongyang Confucian Studio in 2009, which is aimed at popularizing   education in both schools and wider society. He says that classics such as The Analects of Confucius should be taught throughout every stage of education. ""It should first be taught in middle schools, then studied at a deeper level in universities and, finally, for the rest of one's life. It is essentially the task of the entire society to study traditional culture."",Xu Yong, professor of education at Beijing Normal University, concludes that time and patience are needed in popularizing   but modern technology does help accelerate the process. Giving the example of his students who use mobile applications in disseminating guoxue, Xu says, ""It is the responsibility of the younger generation to seek innovation of traditional culture using modern communication methods."" This assertion is exemplified by the school projects of several students from Tsinghua University Primary School, who used data analysis methods to analyze classical poet Su Shi's work and influence on tourism. Other scholars including Yang and Zhu Xiaojian, executive vice-dean of the Institute for Advanced Study of the Humanities and Religion at Beijing Normal University, also recognize the power of technological development in disseminating   and it will depend on future generations to implement the long-term mission of   education."

An item from Sept 2 that year in China Daily showed passengers lining up at the station to embark the first train to travel from Beijing to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, on the new Beijing-Kowloon line. The nation's capital has four railway stations - Beijing, Beijing West, Beijing South and Beijing North. With the establishment of a new administrative center in Tongzhou district, it will soon have another. Construction of the new Beijing Fengtai Station started last year and is expected to be completed by the end of 2020. Once completed, the buildings of the new station will cover 398,000 square meters, which is 78,000 sq m larger than Beijing South Railway Station, currently one of Asia's largest. The project is aimed at easing pressure on Beijing West Railway Station, which reached its capacity of 180,000 passengers a day in 2016. The new Fengtai station is designed with 12 platforms and 22 rail lines, with major high-speed routes, including lines from the capital to Guangzhou, Shanghai and Hong Kong, according to the Beijing Commission of Housing and Urban-Rural Development. The old Fengtai station, built in 1895, was the oldest in the capital. It ceased passenger service in June 2010, and trains just pass through. The city's expansion of railway stations reflects the growth of the country's railway network in recent years. According to a plan issued by the National Development and Reform Commission, China will have a 175,000-kilometer rail network by the end of 2025, including 38,000 km of high-speed track. Since the opening of the first high-speed rail line in 2007, 29,000 km have been laid."
1,"The average person in the United States watches more than four hours of TV a day, or two months of nonstop watching per year. And in a 65-year life, that person will have spent nine years glued to the tube, according to AC Nielsen Co. If US President Donald Trump's proposed tariffs of 25 percent against China go into effect, watching a new high-definition, flat-panel screen could cost more. How much more? There's no consensus on a figure, just that it will be higher. If the full cost of the tariffs is passed on to consumers, a new television would be about $140 more, said Paul Gagnon, an analyst with data firm IHS Markit. ""On a $4,000 TV ... the tariffs might have a several hundred-dollar price impact,"" said David French, senior vice-president for government relations at the National Retail Federation, an advocacy group. The levy could mean higher prices by 4 percent overall and 23 percent for TVs from China, according to a report commissioned by the Consumer Technology Association and another association. TVs and related components are among the more than 1,300 products from China, valued at $50 billion, which would be subject to the 25 percent tariff announced by the Trump administration. Last year, of the 41.5 million TVs exported to the US, about 47 percent were imported from China, according to Bob O'Brien, president of Display Supply Chain Consultants, a market research firm. He said the value of TVs imported from China last year totaled about $4 billion, which would be subject to Trump's tariff. So TV makers who export their products from China to the US would have to pay $1 billion. Gary Shapiro, chief executive of the CTA, told The Wall Street Journal that the tariffs could affect this year's holiday shopping season because retailers are now starting to plan their orders for the end-of-year rush. ""The uncertainty level is extraordinarily high,"" Shapiro said. ""There's potential this could be a major hit to the pocketbooks of Americans, based on what we're seeing right now,"" said Jack Cutts, senior director of business research at the CTA. China exported around 80 million TVs globally last year, with nearly 30 percent, or 23 million, shipped to the US, according to the Beijing-based market researcher Sigmaintell Consulting. That represented $3.9 billion worth of televisions."

Clarinetist Wang Tao is eager to display the versatility of his musical instrument, which has long played an important role in symphony orchestras and jazz groups. In his latest album Spin, Wang plays pieces by composers from different cultures, such as Argentine composer Astor Piazzolla's Histoire du Tango, which was originally written for the flute and guitar, Polish composer Witold Lutoslawski's 5 Dance Preludes for the clarinet and piano, and Austrian composer Fritz Kreisler's 3 Old Viennese Dances for the piano and violin. ""All the pieces in the album contain different colors, showcasing the distinctive characteristics of where they came from,"" Wang says in Beijing. ""For those who know the clarinet, the album enables them to see a different side of the musical instrument. For those who are new to the clarinet, they will know the musical instrument beyond the range of classical music."" Besides colors from different cultures, Wang also ventures into the theme of dance with this album as he seeks to expand the expressive dimension of his musical instrument by merging it with another art form. ""I've performed at venues such as outdoor spaces and galleries rather than traditional concert halls. I've also played with artists, such as ballet dancers and contemporary dancers. All those experiences expanded my vision for the clarinet. I hope the audience could have visions of dynamic dancing while listening to this album,"" he says. His album has already won praise from overseas experts. ""In the hands and breath of Tao, the clarinet becomes an amazing contrast of technical mastery coupled with soulful singing lines. Imagination and surprise in every phrase,"" wrote US clarinetist Richard Leslie Stoltzman on the album's brochure. Wang paired with Japanese pianist Akimi Fukuhara and recorded the new album at the Karuizawa Ohga Hall in Japan. ""The concert hall is surrounded by forests and bathed in ample sunshine. It was a luxurious natural environment to record an album for me,"" recalls Wang, who spent at least eight hours a day for three days recording at the venue. Tokyo-based pianist Fukuhara recalls the experince saying: ""The recording schedule was tight and physical demanding for both of us. We forgot about our daily lives and totally put ourselves in the zone for three days. At the end of the day, it was rewarding."" Born in Osaka, Japan, Fukuhara made her solo debut when she was 13 at the World Youth Symphony Orchestra at the Interlochen Summer Arts Camp in Michigan.,""It was the first collaboration between me and Wang Tao. He gave me lots of freedom while we did the recording,"" the pianist adds. Wang, who was born in Chengdu, Sichuan province, studied the cello and erhu (a two-stringed bowed instrument) in childhood before picking up the clarinet when he was 9 years old. At 11, he was admitted to the middle school affiliated with the Sichuan Conservatory of Music. He was the first musician in China to receive a master's degree in the clarinet from the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing, a top music school in the country. He has been teaching at the school since 2002. Wang has released 12 albums which are now used as teaching materials at the conservatory. He also won the Best Instrumental Album award at the Golden Melody Awards in Taiwan. In 2014, he signed a contract with Universal Music China and released the album Night & Day which merges the clarinet with pop, rock and jazz. In 2017, he released the classical album Schubert in which he selected some of Austrian composer Franz Schubert's most beautiful melodies and arranged them for the clarinet, including Auf dem Wasser zu singen (To Sing On the Water), D. 774, Ave Maria (Ellen's Gesang) D. 839, and An die Musik (To Music), D. 547. ""I can still recall that after the last day of the recording of the Schubert album, I sat on the street outside the Salle de Musique of La Chaux-de-Fonds (the famous concert hall in Switzerland where Wang recorded the album), thinking of all the things I didn't like about myself while recording the album,"" Wang says. The process of creating his latest album was a similarly exhausting experience that involved much self-doubt. Half a year before the recording, Wang practiced eight hours a day at home because all the pieces were new to him and employed new techniques such as circular breathing. As a father of a 3-year-old son, he felt guilty about isolating himself from his family since he had to invest much time into the preparation of the new album. ""I feel grateful to my wife because she has been supportive and never complains,"" says Wang, who married the former Olympic gymnastics champion Liu Xuan in 2013. ""The name of the album, Spin, is called Xuan in Chinese, because I want to dedicate it to my wife."" To promote his new album, Wang is touring around Chinese cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, with pianist Fukuhara."

""I have never met someone whose bad voice can be turned perfect when they are singing,"" she said. ""Although in post production, we can absolutely do that."" After graduating from Beijing Film Academy in film recording major, Mengmeng works in a recording studio in Beijing. Famous artists such as Sun Li and Deng Chao couple, He Jie, Hu Xia, and Xian Zi (Stringer) all record their works in the studio. Being a sound mixer means one needs to stay up late, since the vocal cords of singers perform better after noon. Mengmeng usually starts work at 1 or 2 pm, and works all the way until the early hours.,Mengmeng constantly interacts with singers during post-production. ""A good sound mixer needs to be very patient,"" she said. But certain clients sometimes make her work tough when they struggle to deliver the quality she wants. Producers guide professional singers during recording, and these are great learning opportunities for us, she said. Mengmeng's work does not stop even when she is commuting. As her work involves sitting for hours, she, like many sound mixers, has developed back problems.,Mengmeng also works as a part-time piano teacher. ""When children are bored by musical notation, I divide the notation into passages and make up a story for them,"" she said. ""If there are opportunities, I'd like to be a singer, a backup vocalist, or a music producer,"" she said."

He also said big data needs to work in tandem with artificial intelligence and the internet of things to enhance its ability to safeguard information security.,Romer said he is impressed by China's proposal on cyber sovereignty. He understands this concept as each nation being able to write and enforce its own laws regulating cyberspace, and ensuring cyberspace works to the benefit of everyone in the nation, he said. ""China's articulation and implementation of cyber sovereignty means it is a chance for the world to see a different kind of organization for cyberspace, and a chance to see that with the right structure, we can get tons of benefits,"" Romer added.,Xu said cross-border e-commerce is not only an opportunity for sellers — it also makes global products accessible to Chinese consumers with no need to travel abroad or even leave home. By comparing statistics from 2018 and 2016, expenditures in shopping overseas by Chinese consumers has been shown to decline as a proportion of total tourist spending, Xu said, adding cross-border e-commerce helps Chinese consumers pay less attention to shopping when they travel outside China."

""In addition, those who suffer a property loss due to the connection to a WiFi hotspot under the help of a WiFi Master Key could claim compensation."" ""However, in saying this, since the company introduced insurance in 2015, there has been no such claim."",   He Chao, senior vice-president of We Doctor, with a registered customer base of 165 million, valued at $3 billion, confirmed that the We Doctor Group, whichstarted as an online platform for registration to replace lining up at hospitals, and evolved into an internet hospital platform, aimed to open 100 primary care center nationwide. ""We are not only creating good-quality medical services, but extends these services to more people,"" He said.  ""The We Doctor Primary Care Center, leveraging on many years' effort to connect patients online and doctors offline, as well as many years' efforts in building its connection with hospitals, will change the whole medical service system and bring benefits to the new emerging middle class.""    Wu Zhaoguo, the chairman of Sibu Group, connecting 1.3 million distributors, brick-and-mortar stores, along with business incubators, said he was ""sorry to everyone attending the China Internet Conference."" ""I guess you must have been bothered by people who sold products on WeChat over the last two years, and I was the one that behind those ‘micro retailers',"" Wu said. ""Social commerce is not about products without production date, certification or manufacturer, nor pyramid scheme.""  ""However, illegal merchants took advantage of this form and made our company which paid 200 million yuan in tax last year under great pressure."" ""Over the past three years, I have visited the Ministry of Commerce and State Administration for Industry Commerce to tell officials of how the social commerce model allows those, who have no money to run a business on e-commerce platforms and no money to rent a shop, to start up their own business."",   Zhang Shengbo, founder of Angusmou.com, which is said to connect husbandry, internet and finance, said if you download the app and pay 5,000 yuan, you can adopt an Australian-based Angus.  ""Via this, you can get spot beef directly from Australian ranches at low prices, and by raising this cow, you can get investment returns, which are in the form of future beef,"" Zhang said. ""Over the past year, we have acquired 200,000 such customers and the value of cattle has reached 50 million yuan.  ""We control six ranches in Australia, which is equivalent to the area of four Singapore.  ""In the downstream, we understand that consumers want safe, stable and crystal investment channels, and safe, traceable food at not very high prices. In the upstream, we know ranches want pre-paid cash to decide how much beef to produce."" ""Even if you do not eat beef, you could also raise an animal, and the weight gain of this cowis your return in investment. You could cash it in easily as we have cooperated with an Australian livestock exchange.""  Yu Xin, co-founder of ofo, said on the China Internet Conference on July 12 that in the days before bike-sharing startup ofo, it took almost the same time to travel three kilometers and 20 kilometers in urban cities.

0,"All outdoor activities are banned on Monday at all middle and primary schools, kindergartens and middle vocational schools in Beijing, Beijing Municipal Education Commission said via Sina Weibo on Monday. The move was taken after at least four people died in strong winds a day earlier. Such activities include flag-raising ceremony, morning exercises and outdoor social practices. At least four people were killed, more than 50 flights were diverted to other airports and two trains arrived late in Beijing on Sunday when strong gales flattened walls, knocked down trees and damaged farms. The capital issued blue alert for strong winds on Sunday, with five suburban districts of Tongzhou, Yanqing, Changping, Huairou and Shunyi upgrading it to yellow alert later. These areas were hit with strong winds as high as 8-9 grades, with gales reaching 10 grade at some places. According to forecast, the wind could still be as high as 7-8 grades on Monday. The gale toppled a wall near Dongzhimen Bridge in downtown Beijing, hitting three pedestrians, two males and one female. Two of them died at the scene and one at hospital, Dongcheng District said via Sina Weibo. Food delivery service Meituan said one of its deliverymen was hit and killed by a fallen tree when delivering food.

0,"On the night Liu Jinsong approached Yueyang in Hunan province, he admits he was a bit scared. The streetlights were dim and the road hilly and pebbly, with barely visible sections under repair looming here and there as he rode toward his first destination on a marathon mountain bike trip, his figure dwarfed by the trucks and tractors that roared past. Liu, 46, had set out that morning, on April 26, from his hometown in Changsha, the capital of Hunan, bound for Moscow, more than 11,000 kilometers away. Why Moscow? The 2018 FIFA World Cup is being held in Russia, with the final in the capital on July 15, and Liu is a soccer fan. ""I've always wanted to relate to the World Cup in my own way,"" Liu said. ""I can always show up in the stadium easily as long as I have money, but that's not my way."" Liu fixed his eyes on his bike, bought a year ago but left in a corner because he was busy running his little barbecue restaurant. Cycling to Russia would be difficult, but also fun and unique, he thought. ""I'm also a fan of rock music, and my understanding of rock is to follow you heart,"" he said. ""If I think about doing it, then I will do it. That way my heart remains the same, even if I fail to complete the task."" After three days repairing and preparing his bike, Liu left his business, wife and son behind and hit the road on a drizzly morning, with no prior physical training or route planning. Smiling and motivated, he took pictures in front of his barbecue restaurant and announced his departure on social media. Liu cycled past the Yangtze River and across vast canola plains, but the journey was far tougher than he expected. Five days after setting out he had serious bruises on his thighs and a strained tendon in his left leg, and he had to push his bike some of the time. He reached Beijing on May 8, planning to collect his passport, Russian visa and credit card while taking a brief rest. The two-day break in Beijing, sharing a few drinks with friends, rejuvenated him. He said his body had grown accustomed to long-distance cycling and it would be no problem to stay in the saddle for more than 10 hours at a time. But the adventure beyond Beijing was a journey into the unknown. ""I have no idea how and where I'll stay next or if I will be able to find accommodation or food along the way, but it is these unknown things that make traveling most interesting,"" he said. On May 12, Liu ran into heavy rain that later turned into hailstones, forcing him to stop and seek shelter. As the night wore on, his GPS guided him onto a narrow country road, with the nearest hotel 100 km away. A few dogs barked aggressively when he attempted to pitch his tent in a village, so he set it up in a clearing in front of an old temple, falling asleep with the chanting of monks as a lullaby. On day 28, with 3,300 km conquered, Liu reached the China-Russia border at Manzhouli, in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region, and crossed into a foreign country for the first time in his life. Siberia was vast, but not flat, and the rough roads posed a constant risk of punctures to his tires. Wild animals could have been lurking in the primeval forest and valleys, but Liu was too tired to think about the danger. ""I've lost track of time,"" he said. ""I never want to stop, I'm just a bit tired and sleepy."" Luckily, the people Liu met on the way greeted him warmly, offsetting Siberia's chilly winds. He was offered cozy bedrooms more than once by Russian villagers when he was about to pitch his tent in the cold. He was also offered a ride by a truck driver when the road was too bad for cycling in the dark. The time Liu spent with his new Russian friends forged memories as strong as the vodka they offered him. Liu is still heading to Moscow at full speed, averaging 160 km a day. He will make it to Moscow on July 15 if all goes as planned and will see if anyone is kind enough to give him a free ticket to the final. ""At this stage watching the World Cup is no longer necessary,"" he said. ""I will be satisfied just to feel the World Cup vibes."" Liu's social media posts on his journey have earned him the criticism of some netizens, because his journey has led to the closure of his restaurant, with his wife and son alone at home. He said he plans to start his business all over again and spend more time with his family after he flies home. ""I'm not trying to prove anything to anyone,"" he said. ""I just want to do it, and I believe I can."""
1,"BEIJING - The consensuses reached during economic and trade consultations between China and the United States meet the interests of the people of the two countries and whole world, Chinese Vice-Premier Liu He said on Monday. Liu, just returned from the United states, referred to the talks as ""positive, pragmatic, and productive"" with some important consensuses reached. The vice -premier made the remarks while meeting some attendees at the fourth China-US governors' forum. Liu expressed hope that the two sides would take the forum as an opportunity to further advance all-round pragmatic cooperation at the local level and promote stable and sound development of bilateral ties. Bill Walker, governor of Alaska and John Sanchez, lieutenant governor of New Mexico, were among attendees at the forum. They told Liu that the whole world is celebrating for the consensuses reached between China and the United States on economic and trade issues. They pledged to further strengthen cooperation with China in such areas as trade, investment, green development and people-to-people exchanges at the local level, so as to make positive contribution to bilateral ties. Also Monday, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lu Kang told a daily news briefing that China expects no further reversals in trade and economic ties with the United States. ""If the governments of the two countries reach a good agreement and results that are acceptable to both, they should stick to the agreement. Of course, we do not want to see any reversal,"" said Lu. Based on the experiences of the past four decades, the fundamental reason why both nations have been able to manage disputes has been that the relationship is in the best interest of both countries and their people, he added. ""We hope that the China-US trade and economic relations, which are mutually beneficial and win-win in nature, will play a more effective role,"" said the spokesperson."
1,"Graduates from two top universities in Beijing will be granted fast-track Shanghai household registration authorization if they choose to work in the financial hub, according to a new policy issued by the city's education commission. Under a pilot program, those with bachelor's degrees from Peking University or Tsinghua University who have been offered jobs in Shanghai will be granted preferential treatment in their applications for Shanghai household registration permits, or hukou, which afford holders a full range of benefits including pensions, healthcare and child education stipends as well as auto and apartment purchasing quotas. The policy comes at a time when a long list of Chinese cities — including Beijing, Tianjin and Shenzhen — have offered to provide various incentives to attract talent, including hukou privileges. ""Shanghai's new policy ... significantly cuts the time required to obtain a Shanghai hukou under a points-based system,"" said Lu Yujie, managing consultant of human resources company Cornerstone Global Partners. First-tier cities like Shanghai and Beijing are feeling the pressure as second- and third-tier ones are attracting top graduates with preferential policies, but Shanghai, over the long term, needs to address its high living costs and property prices if it wants to attract and retain more talent, Lu said. With a population of nearly 25 million, Shanghai first started using a points-based hukou system for nonlocal graduates in 2004, with preference given to those with higher degrees and grade-point averages, as well as graduates with specialized skills in technology and other areas. With the updated policy, graduates from Peking and Tsinghua universities are exempted from the tedious points-generating process for hukou registrations, and only need to meet ""basic requirements"" if they are offered full-time jobs in Shanghai. Some students in Beijing from the two institutions said the policy is still not enough to attract them to work in Shanghai. Xu Haozhe, a postgraduate student at Peking University's law school, said, ""All my friends and potential business partners are in Beijing, and I have to make new friends if I go to Shanghai."" Huang Yunwen, a junior student majoring in computer science at Peking University, said in the IT sector, Beijing offers more opportunities and choices. ""But that does not mean Shanghai is losing its appeal. I saw schoolmates talking on social media about landing jobs in Shanghai."""

A tribunal at the Beijing Haidian District People's Court has accepted 2,636 civil and commercial cases this year, with 1,698 concluded, according to statistics provided on Tuesday.  In March, the average number of cases tribunal judges concluded was 83, the highest in the capital, the statistics showed.  ""Generally, a civil or commercial case should be concluded within three months, but for cases where there are clear facts and sufficient evidence, we have accelerated the process of filing and hearing cases, allowing more time to deal with more complicated cases,"" the court said.  ""We are also focusing on mediation efforts in simple disputes,aiming to resolve cases before they are sent to courtrooms."" For example, a woman surnamed Leng received her mediation document on Tuesday, within a week of the court accepting the case. ""My dispute involves the right to inherit family property,"" Leng said. ""I sued another four family members over the inheritance a home left by my grandparents.""  Wang Kege, the tribunal judge responsible for the case, told China Daily the case involved sufficient evidence and clear facts, ""so I decided to conclude it promptly"".

On Tuesday, the trial lasted about 20 minutes, with the judge saying he was ""glad to see the litigants agreed to solve their dispute through mediation"". To ensure the litigants did not have to return to the court again to collect mediation documents, the court sent the paperwork to them.

0,"A contemporary art exhibition in Beijing shows the works of some 40 artists and provides clues to future trends. Lin Qi reports.  As technology enriches forms of individual expression, there are worries that it will gain even more control of people's lives. So, how will the relationship between humans and technology evolve? How will human society change as machines and robots take on more manual jobs? As people experience an explosion of information, are they becoming insensitive to their surroundings? These topics are in the spotlight at a contemporary art exhibition now on at Minsheng Art Museum Beijing. The third   looks at these developments in Chinese art in 2016, showing the works of some 40 artists and providing clues to future trends. The artists are featured in the latest issue of  a book published by the Center for Visual Studies of Peking University. The book, which was released at the opening of the exhibition, showcases the center's efforts to monitor the contemporary art scene. It features events, exhibitions and artists' creations in 2016.,  Since 2015, the center has collaborated with the art museum in Beijing to stage an exhibition every year of artworks featured in the annual publication. The latest book says more than 3,780 contemporary art exhibitions were held in the country in 2016, an increase of nearly 200 compared with 2015. The Minsheng exhibition focuses on established artists, who have spearheaded the rise of Chinese contemporary art, and also those whose works have received good reviews and market response. The late artist Chen Shaoxiong's work  a four-channel video installation, is on show. It was also on show at Chen's solo exhibition at Beijing's Tang Contemporary Art Gallery, which ended on Nov 27 in 2016, a day after Chen died. Chen, a graduate of the   Academy of Fine  had co-founded Da Wei Xiang, an important experimental art group in Guangzhou in the early 1990s. His conceptual works combine photographs, videos, installations and ink-brush  s. In his works, he examined the changing landscape of Chinese urbanization, and invited audiences to reflect on the manic and ridiculous aspects of city life.,  In  animated ink-brush paintings of day-to-day scenes, such as abandoned railways, bare tree branches and night views, are projected on four standing screens that form a circle. When visitors stand before the screens, their silhouettes become part of the works. Chen once said: ""What we see is not what we think. What we want to see is not what we are supposed to see."" His wife Luo Qingmin says that in his last days, when he was sick, he was even more sensitive to the surrounding scenery, religion and life, and she says that Chen used the circle of four screens to indicate the circle of life, ""a timeless feeling like that of lights at night"". Meanwhile, new media artist Tian Xiaolei from Beijing, who was born in 1982, takes a visual approach to expressing his understanding of the relationship between people and their environment that has been reshaped by technological progress. His work   shows a 3-minute-long animation. He creates ""an imagined utopia"", in which there is no distinction between a human and a robot: They work together, they fight each other, and they fall in love. With the assistance of virtual reality technology, viewers ""enter"" a surreal world and ""embrace an uncertain future for human society"", says Tian. Zhou Yan, who was the curator of Tian's recent exhibition in Toronto, says his output celebrates social landscapes that have been transformed by computers, mobile phones and the internet, but also reveal the anxieties and loneliness deep in people's hearts.,  Zhu Qingsheng, the Minsheng exhibition curator and a history professor at Peking University, says that while the ancient Chinese saw classic mountain-and-water paintings as ""  (bed travel)"",meaning that one could enjoy landscapes by looking at paintings and not leave home, in the modern world people no longer need the paintings. ""The internet has turned the world into a network of information that connects people even more closely than how people connected with nature earlier,"" Zhu says. He says while ""bed travel"" moved people with beautiful landscape, today there is a new form of that travel－accessible information through all kinds of devices that is invading people's lives.

The report is based on a survey conducted in 37 cities nationwide including Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Xi'an, and Shenzhen. The online recruitment platform said that winter is usually an off-peak season for recruiters. However, the number of positions posted by companies and the number of resumes that companies receive for job postings in the last quarter of 2018 saw a slight increase as compared to the previous three quarters. ""On average, 32 candidates compete for one job this winter,"" stated the Zhaopin report. ""Beijing is the most popular city among job seekers with nearly 90 applicants for one job, and it is followed by Shenzhen, Shenyang and Shanghai."" Job seekers in the information technology, transportation services and financial management sectors face the most competition this winter, according to the report. The report stated that the average salary offered by recruiters this winter in 37 cities is 8,096 yuan ($1,180), a 3.9 percent increase from the same period in 2017. Beijing remains at the top with salary offers reaching 10,871 yuan this winter. This is followed with salaries offered in Shanghai at 10,164 yuan, and salaries in Shenzhen at 9,776 yuan.

0,"Celebrated Chinese writers Liu Cixin and Yu Hua made presentations on Wednesday, the opening day of the 25th Beijing International Book Fair and the 16th Beijing International Book Festival. Their appearance created a buzz among fairgoers. Yu Hua, author of To Live, met about 30 Sinologists, including some of his translators. ""The translations are not inferior to the original literary text to me; they are parallel,"" Yu said. ""My connections with Sinologists, as well as foreign publishers, helped my works to be accepted in foreign markets."" And Three Body trilogy author Liu said he counts himself among the old-school writers of science fiction－those who have been more into scientific theories and discoveries－rather than what he observes as a trend in his genre telling stories about racial and gender discrimination. The writers' presentations were among 1,000 or more during the fair, which runs until Sunday. Hailed as the world's second-largest international book meeting, the fair attracted 2,500 publishing organizations from 93 countries and regions. A total of 300,000 titles will be displayed in the sea of books. To address hot trends in the global publishing business, the fair put emphasis on children's publishing, integration with high-tech companies, elements from local culture and a better reading experience. It also serves as the key event dealing with copyright and highlighting international publishing exchanges. ""Chinese publishers have connections with publishers from 190 countries and regions. The international cooperation deepens exchanges and understanding, and boosts the harmonious development of diverse civilizations,"" said Liang Yanshun, deputy head of the Publicity Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Zhao Haiyun, an official in the section that deals with publishing cooperation, said Chinese publishers have stepped up their exploration of international markets, and are keen to attract more readers abroad－""but more efforts need to be made in terms of building an intact mechanism to produce, plan, sell and promote"", he said. The State Administration of Press and Publication, formerly the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television, said in its latest report that China sold 13,816 copyrights to overseas buyers in 2017, up 24.1 percent year-on-year. China has a publishing market that reaped a total income of 1.8 trillion yuan ($264 billion) in 2017, an increase of 4.5 percent from 2016. Digital publishing gained 707 billion yuan in 2017, up 23.6 percent from the previous year. The Kingdom of Morocco was featured as the guest of honor of the fair. Moroccan writer Fathallah Oualalou, once the mayor of its capital city, brought his book China and Us to the fair. He has been to China nine times. ""In the past, we thought China was so far away. Now the Belt and Road Initiative brings us closer, and we see more opportunities in cultural, educational and scientific cooperation,"" Oualalou said."
1,"Liu Ya, a 28-year-old manager at a public relations agency in Beijing, switches on her phone and opens a fitness app. With just a few taps, she has registered for her weekly barre class, which involves using a handrail that provides support for various types of exercise, incorporates movements derived from ballet, and combines positions and movements drawn from yoga and Pilates. On a designated day, Liu goes to the fitness room, checks in with her phone, changes into sports gear and awaits the start of the class with 39 others. This is her routine before each weekly workout. After an hour of sweaty activity, she sometimes takes photos of the session to post on WeChat. ""I think the internet has really changed the way people work out,"" she said. ""The fitness apps give us more options. Rather than just going to a gym and training by yourself or hiring a private trainer, they can link online and offline alternatives."" With the rapid growth of fitness communities and increasing demand for professional instruction, new trends have emerged in recent years, attracting young users through socializing, group classes, qualified coaching and flexible payment methods.,In March, sports technology company Keep opened three offline fitness rooms in Beijing called Keepland. The aim is to persuade some of its online users to join offline communities, helping cultivate loyalty and fueling enthusiasm. According to a report from market research consultancy Analysys in Beijing, as of April, more than 68 million people in China were using online platforms to support sporty lifestyles－a year-on-year rise of 2.22 percent. Li Jinyi, vice-president of Keep, said online users' needs will be upgraded and Keepland can keep up with such changes. ""Users may not have that much time to go online and find solutions, or they can't find exactly what they need. But the offline courses can help locate weaknesses or provide future goals, which coaches can guide people to attain,"" he said. Fitness brand SpaceCycle was launched in 2015 by Matthew Allison, the former president of EMI Music in Asia, and now has six clubs in Beijing, Shanghai and Taipei, in Taiwan, offering cycling, yoga, barre and dance classes with inspiring background music. Liu, a SpaceCycle member, said she sometimes uses its app for more than just registering for classes. ""You can search for some music and buy fitness gear with just one app. You can also post and browse photos of people working out, and chat with others to get motivation,"" she said. ""I think the fitness apps are trying to mix working out and socializing."" Li said it is important to socialize, as people need encouragement from others to advance, and users can get together and form a community by attending offline salons or other activities at Keepland.,""It's hard to persist by yourself,"" he said. ""But if you have a partner or team members, the interactions and encouragement can support you in finally achieving your goal."" Li said another reason to socialize is to help users improve their athletic performance, as they can communicate with coaches and exchange experiences with classmates after sessions, especially when more people want to work out and choose a suitable training plan. Keepland has installed a screen that can interact with users by showing the latest content, technology and activities. ""It is also convenient for us to organize better offline activities, salons and discussions, and a variety of communication activities are even organized by users themselves. This is how we can provide more for the users,"" Li said. In recent years, the Chinese government has introduced policies to vigorously support the development of the health service and sports fitness industries, and to promote expansion of the fitness industry. In 2013, the State Council issued a guideline to promote development of the health service industry－extending the nationwide fitness campaign and increasing awareness of physical fitness.,In 2016, the National Fitness Program for 2016-20 was launched by the State Council to promote overall health development, with the target of getting 435 million people to regularly take part in physical exercise by 2020. According to IBISWorld, a global business intelligence information provider, over the past five years, the fitness industry in China has grown by 11.2 percent to reach revenue of $7 billion this year. In the same time, the number of businesses has grown by 8.7 percent and the number of employees has risen by 7.6 percent. With the number of traditional training facilities rising from about 500 in 2001 to more than 37,000 this year, different fitness brands providing personalized group classes on the internet, or related technology, are appearing and have proved popular, especially among the younger generation, according to the China Briefing website. Keepland offers self-developed mixed intensity and training, also known as MIXT, and specialized fitness courses for its offline users as well as providing smart sports devices for real-time monitoring of body data. The program integrates online and offline data to facilitate the development of personalized fitness regimens. Li said data collection and continued curriculum development as well as cooperation with other fitness systems has led to nearly 280 courses being provided to meet users' needs. The classes include ""Bubble Butt"" for hip and leg toning, ""Core Master"" for abdominal muscles, and dancing classes such as Zumba (a dance form with an aerobics fitness program). Xia Jinglong, co-founder of Supermonkey, said it is paying close attention to self-developed classes to meet customers' needs. ""The fitness needs in China and abroad are quite different due to diverse cultural influences,"" he said. ""For example, we have developed the 'Butt Shaper' lesson, which is more suitable for Chinese, as female practitioners wish to reshape their hips, but want to keep their legs slim at the same time."" Founded in 2014 in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, Supermonkey now has more than 100 fitness rooms in seven cities, including Beijing and Shanghai. Xia said curriculum innovation reflects changes in the fitness concept in China, as more people now understand that this is essentially a way of life. Liu said the classes she has registered for with SpaceCycle, which she takes once or twice a week, allow her to meet basic exercise needs and maintain her health.,""People used to think that being skinny was beautiful, especially for women,"" she said. ""But now the concept has been changing, with more and more people appreciating the beauty of a healthy, slim, or even muscular shape."" Meanwhile, customers are paying more attention to the quality of classes, another change brought by the increased awareness of fitness. Liang Junyao, a 30-year-old graphic designer who takes classes at Supermonkey, said small-sized ones can greatly improve her athletic ability, since coaches can take care of each member and offer advice. Liang said a traditional gym may be more suitable for those who have already formed fitness habits, have a certain level of knowledge of the subject, and know how to use the facilities, while small-sized classes are ideal for newcomers or those who need inspiration and instruction. ""Many traditional gyms have similar courses, but they always have too many members at a time when the coaches may not have proper qualifications,"" he said. Liang has frequently attended a group class studio at Supermonkey, whose instructors all have international qualifications, and some are even regional project leaders for world-class fitness regimens in China. Li, from Keep, said most of the coaches at Keepland are self-trained, but he will invite some from the industry with the right qualifications to work part-time, especially when there are not enough coaches to match the number of courses. Keepland recently signed an agreement with the Champion Foundation, which was established by former speed skater Yang Yang in 2008 to help retired athletes. These athletes have provided a steady supply of coaches for the brand. Keep is also preparing to launch a virtual coaching service by using artificial intelligence. By combining all the exercise data from online users, as well as smart health and fitness facilities, Keep believes virtual coaching services can help more consumers to access personalized coaching services relatively cheaply. With consumption upgrades accelerating, more people are paying attention to their quality of life and physical health, and are more willing to pay for ""fitness consumption"", according to a report on Chinese consumers released by consulting company Accenture in July. Last year, the value of China's fitness industry was about 150 billion yuan ($21.43 billion), and its compound annual growth rate in the past six years was 7.7 percent, according to analysis company Zhi Yan. Targeting clients ages 25 to 35 in first- and second-tier cities, Supermonkey wants to take the retail route to encourage more people to work out, Xia said, with the main consumption method being pay-per-visit. Each class costs less than 100 yuan at most of the facilities, including Keepland, Supermonkey and Space-Cycle. In addition to paying each time they visit, customers can choose to buy packages for fitness classes."
0,"BEIJING -- Average density of PM2.5 in Beijing was 58 micrograms per cubic meter of air in 2017, meeting the goal set by the State Council, an official said Wednesday. The density dropped by 20.5 percent compared with the average level in 2016, Liu Baoxian, deputy director of Beijing environmental protection monitoring center, told a press conference. The PM2.5 data is a gauge monitoring airborne particles of 2.5 microns or less in diameter, which can embed deep in people's lungs. Density of major pollutants sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and PM10 also dropped drastically to 8, 46 and 84 micrograms per cubic meter of air, down 20 percent, 4.2 percent and 8.7 percent, respectively, compared with 2016. The capital saw 226 good air days in 2017, 28 days more than in 2016. The number of heavy pollution days decreased by 16 to 23, he said. An air pollution prevention and control action plan issued by the State Council in September 2013 ordered Beijing to reduce its PM 2.5 density to around 60 micrograms per cubic meter of air by 2017, from the average level of 90 micrograms per cubic meter of air in 2013. ""Among air pollution control efforts are demolition of coal-fired boilers, phasing out vehicles with high emission and upgrading of industrial structure,"" said Li Xiang, with the Beijing municipal bureau of environmental protection. Li said small coal-fired boilers had almost been eradicated with heaters switching to gas or electricity, and most districts, including those in the city proper, had stopped coal use. Since 2013, Beijing has shut down six cement plants and closed or upgraded nearly 2,000 companies in printing, casting, furniture manufacturing and other sectors, she said."

0,"A man’s appeal against a conviction for illegally buying products made of ivory has been rejected, Beijing No 2 Intermediate People’s Court said on Monday. The 48-year-old man, surnamed Lei, from Hebei province, was earlier sentenced to nine years and six months in prison by Beijing’s Xicheng district court for illegally purchasing endangered wildlife products. The illegally bought ivory was worth about 900,000 yuan ($129,595), according to the district court, which also fined Lei 10,000 yuan. Lei was unhappy with the verdict and appealed to the intermediate people’s court. “But after a review, we found the facts and evidence identified by the lower court were true and sufficient,” the intermediate court said in a statement. Lei’s behavior breached the Criminal Law, and the amount of ivory he bought was large, it said. The law stipulates that people who illegally purchase endangered wildlife products should be jailed for between five and 10 years if the circumstances are serious. “The original judgment should be upheld, as the conviction and sentence were correctly in line with the law,” the intermediate people’s court said. In October 2017, Lei paid 200,000 yuan to buy about 17 kilograms of ivory products via WeChat, the Chinese instant-messaging app. He was caught by police on Nov 8 last year after paying another 26,000 yuan on WeChat to buy 4.42 kg of ivory products."

1,"Online education has played a significant role in relieving burdens for both students and teachers, a recent report said on Sunday. According to the report by Beijing Normal University and leading online education firm Zuoyebang, 55.8 percent of students surveyed believed that online education platforms can save time by improving studying efficiency. Over 65 percent of students said that online platforms have played a role in relieving their mental stress while 58.2 percent noted that studying online increased their interest in learning. ""Online education platforms have played a significant role in relieving burdens and improving efficiency for students,"" said Zhang Hongzhong, head of the Research Center for New Media Communications at Beijing Normal University. ""It is the internet and technology that make personalized education a possibility. The combination of the internet and education broadens the scope of educational burden relief,"" he added. The report also pointed out that online education platforms also offer an equal learning opportunity for students from remote areas, which also is a relief for parents, as the online studying fee is on average 30 to 50 percent of that offline. In Zuoyebang, for instance, users from remote areas can take online lessons taught by famous teachers in big cities through Zuoyebang Yike, its livestreaming course. Earlier data showed that some 60 percent of Zuoyebang's users are based in lower-tier cities. A review of the top 10 areas in terms of average app-use time per user shows that 45 percent of users come from relatively underdeveloped areas, including Northwest China's Ningxia Hui and Xinjiang Uygur autonomous regions, and Southwest China's Yunnan province. Su Jing, vice-president of Zuoyebang, said that the firm aims to use advanced education and technology to help students keep a balance between study and work. ""At the same time, as we leverage artificial intelligence to achieve efficient and personalized study experiences for students, we are also reducing the economic burden for more families to promote education equity,"" she said."
0,"The Beijing subway system plans to introduce bio-recognition technology at stations this year to improve transport efficiency and reduce costs, a senior manager said last week. Two bio-recognition technologies－facial recognition and palm touch－are being considered, said Zhang Huabing, head of enterprise development for Beijing Subway, the operator of most lines in the city, during the International Metro Transit Exhibition in Beijing on Thursday. Facial recognition technology can track passenger movements with cameras connected to online networks that recognize people when they enter a station, potentially allowing them to bypass traditional ticketing. ""The technique aims to reduce transit time when passengers enter the station,"" said Wang Jianwei, director of the railway business department at tech giant Huawei, which has installed facial recognition technology in its factory. Wang said the technology is mature and can be widely applied in the subway system, but how passengers will pay for tickets remains a problem. The Shanghai subway system currently uses biological recognition technology. Passengers can swipe their hands to gain entry at gate machines. The hand images are immediately compared with files in a background database, said Li Weizhen, marketing director of Shanghai Zhangteng Information Technology. According to Shanghai Metro passenger rules, six special groups of people, including disabled soldiers, retired cadres, blind people, veterans, families of wartime martyrs and wounded police officers can use the subways free. Shanghai promoted the palm vein technology for the special groups on its Pujiang Line in March. Beijing has 22 urban railway lines totaling 608 kilometers. More than 10 million passengers ride the city's subway trains every weekday. In 2016, the 15 lines operated by Beijing Subway transported people on more than 3 billion trips, up by 6.8 percent year-on-year, according to information on the company's website. Liu Xiaoming, vice-minister of transport, said in a news conference that 96 subway stations in Beijing－one-fourth of the total－had implemented measures limiting passengers during peak hours. ""Some stations had to adopt the measures to reduce the heavy passenger flow because the station area is too small and transfers are difficult,"" he said. ""Especially during morning and evening peak hours, long lines form at the station entrances."" ""Predicting passenger flow needs to be strengthened,"" he added."
1,"BEIJING - A meeting was held in Beijing Sunday to celebrate the 70th founding anniversary of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy, which falls on April 23. Participants to the meeting reviewed the PLA Navy's history of developing from almost nothing to becoming strong, summarized its experiences on combat, reform, transformation, and military struggle preparedness, and looked into the bright future of building it into a world-class navy in the new era. It was pointed out that the PLA Navy has gradually developed into a powerful modern navy that can effectively safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests. In particular, the navy has undergone historic changes and made historic achievements since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, which was held in 2012, the meeting concluded. It also vowed that officers and soldiers of the navy will make their contributions to speeding up the navy's transformation and development and building it into a world-class force. At the meeting, units and individuals were honored for making outstanding contributions to the navy's development. Over 1,300 people, including leaders from organs of the Central Military Commission, and representatives of the military units, attended the event."
0,"BEIJING - President Xi Jinping will deliver a keynote speech at the opening ceremony of the Conference on Dialogue of Asian Civilizations to be held on May 15 in Beijing, a senior official said Thursday. Xu Lin, deputy head of the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and director of the State Council Information Office, made the announcement at a press conference. Under the theme of ""exchanges and mutual learning among Asian civilizations and a community with a shared future,"" the conference includes an opening ceremony and sub-forums, said Xu, also vice president of the event's executive committee. More than 2,000 government officials and representatives of various circles from 47 Asian countries and other countries outside the region will attend the opening ceremony and forums, said Xu. A grand Asian culture carnival, an Asian civilization week, and an Asian food festival will also be held during the event. The culture carnival is expected to gather around 30,000 people from home and abroad, according to the official. The Asian civilization week features parades, cultural performances, a culture and tourism exhibition, a film week, and a joint exhibition of Asian civilizations. The food festival will be held in four cities: Beijing, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, and Chengdu. So far, more than 2,800 Chinese and foreign journalists have signed up to cover the conference. And Beijing has recruited more than 3,700 volunteers for the event, figures from the organizer show. The conference is expected to reach rich and concrete results, such as a series of bilateral and multi-lateral initiatives and agreements, and the results of projects and research will also be announced during the conference, Xu said at the press conference."
1,"The Mogao Grottoes, an art performance and a lecture featuring the ancient history of Dunhuang in Northwest China's Gansu province drew a delegation closer to Silk Road culture during their tour from Sept 1-2. ""I'd heard a lot about Dunhuang before, but it was mind-blowing to see everything here myself,"" said Mellat Dilnar from  's Alma-Ata. ""It's incredible that those ancient heritages are perfectly protected now, and research about them so profound,"" the 28-year-old added. Dilnar is studying comparative literature and cross-culture in Beijing at the moment. She said the visit helped her to better understand Chinese culture and cast some light on the connections between China and her country long ago. ""I've found certain   elements in the Dunhuang culture,"" Dilnar says. Dilnar is one member of the delegation that includes foreign students, a Chinese think tank and multinational company representatives. The ancient Silk Road tour was initiated by the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries and is aimed at promoting trade and cultural exchange. The tour kicked off in Beijing and continues until Sept 29. It will cover nine places in seven countries, including Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Poland, the Czech Republic, France and the Netherlands. Business talks, youth forums, cultural exhibitions and sport exchanges are to be staged during the tour. Gansu is the third leg of the tour's China visit, following Beijing and Inner Mongolia autonomous region."
1,"As global trade threatens to degenerate into a mines-laced economic battlefield, the dark forces of unilateralism and protectionism find themselves arrayed against the righteous whose weapons are multilateralism, a strong sense of justice and fair play, a functional moral compass and a commitment to protecting growth, no matter what, said institutional officials and business leaders. China has been unrelenting in its efforts to optimize its industrial structure, launch new trade boosters like the China International Import Expo (which begins in Shanghai on Monday), and bring about tangible transcontinental development through the Belt and Road Initiative. These moves will inject more growth momentum into the troubled global economy, they said. ""China's foreign trade is set to continue its steady run for the rest of the year as it is on track to reach its annual trade growth target, despite ongoing trade disputes with the United States,"" said Li Kuiwen, director-general of the Department of Statistics, which is part of the General Administration of Customs. Li was referring to China's trade volume that surged 9.9 percent year-on-year to 22.28 trillion yuan ($3.22 trillion) in the first three quarters of this year. Official data showed the almost 10-percent rise was possible due to the country's diversified trade activities with emerging economies, rapid growth in private companies' trade, and a surge in trade volume on the back of the BRI. Economic stability and healthy growth in China are good not just for the country but the world as well, because the mainland is a very important part of the global value chain. The BRI has proven to be a win-win proposition for China and the countries and regions participating in it. But it is by no means the country's first win-win attempt in global trade. In 1950, when China Import Co was established, it heralded the country's broadminded approach to global trade. In 1951, China Import Co morphed into China Import and Export Co. Its job was to build trade ties with various countries and trade China's goods, mainly coal, timber, agricultural products, porcelain and silk in the global markets. As it transpired, China Import Co was to be the precursor of Sinochem Group, the State-owned chemical firm. The six decades since then - it was a period that saw China adopting the reform and opening-up policy in the last 40 years - have shown the humble beginnings laid a strong foundation for what is today a manufacturing, services and innovation powerhouse. That's not all. China has also emerged as a strong supporter of multilateralism under the framework of the World Trade Organization. This holds the key to future global economic growth, experts said. To be sure, the rise of protectionism, and simultaneous fluctuations in the global financial and commodity markets, have hurt China in some areas. But, the fourth-quarter data at the year-end or early next year will likely again confirm the country's trade-sustaining resilience. Not just the current quarter, even in the long run, China's trade will be underpinned by diversified channels, and commitment to the reform and opening-up policy, said Li Yong, vice-chair of the expert committee at the China Association of International Trade. He further said China has been giving ""great importance to risk prevention and steady growth. Its overall leverage level is not very high, but at a moderate level globally"". Official data showed that China's imports of major commodities increased in terms of both volume and price in the first three quarters. Foreign shipments of crude oil to China increased by 5.9 percent, natural gas by 34 percent, refined oil by 9.8 percent year-on-year and copper by 16.1 percent year-on-year between January and September. ""The increase in commodity imports indicates that the country's demand for manufacturing and energy raw materials remains large,"" said Li. ""After all, the global demand for Chinese goods related to infrastructure, manufacturing, urbanization and modern agricultural sectors has kept growing, especially in countries and regions involved in the Belt and Road Initiative."" China's total trade with countries and regions related to the initiative exceeded $5 trillion over the past five years, with an annual average growth of 1.1 percent, in contrast to falling world trade, said Qian Keming, vice-minister of commerce. The nation's outbound direct investment has amounted to over $60 billion in economies involved in the BRI, creating over 244,000 local jobs over the past five years. China has become the largest trade partner of 25 partner economies, data from the Ministry of Commerce showed. ""We have seen populism, nationalism and protectionism rising and they inevitably led to intolerance and isolation in recent years. The world must find a new equilibrium to combat poverty and create prosperity for all. The Belt and Road Initiative, in this sense, can be a robust driving force for global economic growth,"" said Lothar Herrmann, president of Siemens Ltd China.,While collaboration between Chinese and foreign companies in projects in infrastructure, resources and manufacturing remains key to unlocking the economic development potential of many countries and regions related to the initiative, digital connectivity will create more business opportunities for Chinese and foreign companies in these markets, and in other parts of the world as well, said Vaughn Barber, global chair for KPMG Global China Practice. ""New and cutting-edge technologies are providing a range of new possibilities for Chinese companies, in both traditional and high value-added industries,"" Barber said, adding they are helping ""boost productivity, further unlock new demand and increase their competitiveness in domestic and global markets"". Barber's view is shared by Xin Guobin, vice-minister of industry and information technology. He said China will accelerate the pace of developing high-end manufacturing and digital technologies to further enhance the country's export capabilities. China has already taken measures to improve its export structure, with exports of automobiles expanding by 16.3 percent year-on-year and machine tools by 18.7 percent year-on-year between January and September. Exports of electrical and mechanical products rose by almost 8 percent to 6.91 trillion yuan, accounting for 58 percent of the country's total export value, according to the GAC. In addition to maritime transportation, over 10,000 railway trips had marked the China-Europe freight train service from 2011 to the end of August. The freight trains transported nearly 800,000 containers of goods. The cargo rail network so far links 48 Chinese cities with 43 cities in 15 European countries such as Germany, Spain, Poland and the United Kingdom. ""The combination of China's competitive labor costs, and foreign capital and technology since the country's reform and opening-up drive, has helped facilitate its trade growth and secure its pricing advantage,"" said Long Guoqiang, vice-president of the Development Research Center, which is part of the State Council, China's cabinet. Long said this transformation has also generated handsome returns for foreign companies through both local sales and exports from China. Because China is omnipresent in the supply chains of many consumer and industrial products across the world, a number of global companies have increased investment in China to sustain robust growth so far this year. For instance, German chemical giant BASF SE and the US petrochemical group Exxon-Mobil Corp have signed agreements this year with the Guangdong provincial government to build wholly foreign-owned plants, each entailing an investment of $10 billion. Tesla Inc, the US technology major, is expected to start the construction of a $2 billion electric vehicle plant in Shanghai before the year-end. The factory will have a projected annual capacity of 500,000 e-vehicles. Foreign direct investment edged up almost 3 percent year-on-year to 636.7 billion yuan in the first nine months of this year. FDI in high-tech sectors, which accounted for 22.5 percent of the total, climbed almost 7 percent year-on-year, data from the Ministry of Commerce showed. ""After benefiting significantly from the first wave of globalization, China is now starting a new influential trend, by growing its domestic market, and by improving the quality (of goods and services) and environmental requirements, both on the industrial and consumer sides,"" said Denis Depoux, one of the top regional executives of German consulting firm Roland Berger. To better compete with other established rivals from both domestic and global markets, sportswear manufacturer Nike Inc opened a massive store in Shanghai last month. Nike aims to attract digital-savvy younger Chinese consumers with its digital integration, innovations and personalized services. ""As the government has already lowered its value added tax on imports as well as taxes on vehicles and auto parts, medicines and consumer goods, the CIIE will help push more goods and services trade deals between Chinese and global companies,"" said Sang Baichuan, a professor of international trade at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing."
0,"A film director uses a unique way to keep up the traditions of the ethnic Mongolian way of life. June is a special month for Chinese film director Uragshaa (Wuershan) because he celebrates four birthdays, for his father, his two sons and himself. So, Uragshaa decided to mark birthdays differently. Instead of spending money on food and drinks, he has started a project called Nomad Relays along with musician Ilchi, anthropologist Uradyn E. Bulag and contemporary artist Chyanga. The nonprofit project features academic lectures, film screenings, art exhibitions and live music performances to present the charms of nomadic culture, exploring its contemporary significance and reflecting on its future. The project took off on June 30 at Chaoyang Park in Beijing. And the park site, named Mongol Camp, had dozens of Mongolian-style tents. During the one-day event, about 300 people attended a lecture titled Nomadism as Method by Bulag, watched a documentary, titled Shaman's Ladder directed by filmmaker Agtachin Zorigt, and viewed a contemporary art work, titled All Thing, by artist Chyanga, besides enjoying music performances by bands including Tuvan group Huun-Huur-Tu, Beijing-based Hanggai and Mongolism. ""Urbanization has changed the way Mongolian people live. Nomadic herding is disappearing. So, given the circumstances, what is nomadic culture now?"" says Uragshaa, who was born in Hohhot, the capital of the Inner Mongolia autonomous region, to ethnic Mongolian parents. ""With this project, we want to combine different art forms, and provide the audience with information and perspectives on nomadic culture. It's also a chance for me to observe, reflect and learn about my roots."",Uragshaa, 46, moved to Beijing with his family in 1976 when he was 4 years old. But his family still maintains the typical lifestyle of the Mongolian people, such as drinking Mongolian milk tea and eating mutton. Uragshaa became interested in Mongolian culture after reading Japanese writer Yasushi Inoue's novel, The Blue Wolf, which is about the life of Genghis Khan. And the film director has also used Mongolian ethnic music elements, including the morin khuur (the horse-head fiddle) and khoomei (a traditional throat-singing technique of Mongolia and Tova) in his film productions, including the record-breaking film, The Painted Skin: The Resurrection, and the fantasy adventure blockbuster Mojin: The Lost Legend, which won the Best Visual Effects Award at the Taiwan Golden Horse Film Festival. Currently, he is working on the Fengshen Triology, which will be followed by another film based on a Mongolian ethnic group. As for why he launched the Nomad Relays project, he says that it goes back to 2013 when he read an article written by anthropologist Bulag of the University of Cambridge, Department of Social Anthropology about the relationship between nomadic culture and the contemporary world, the spirit of nomadic culture and its future. Later, he contacted Bulag and when he decided to launch the project, the London-based professor joined in. Bulag, 53, explains his involvement in the project, saying: ""Now, we are all nomads in the age of globalization. We travel and move from one place to another. ""Many people long for their lost nomadic heritage, but it's hard to define nomadic culture now. So we have launched this project to share our ideas with people from different cultural backgrounds."" Hanggai singer Ilchi, who is also part of the project, met Uragshaa about 20 years ago in Beijing at a live house when Ilchi performed there with his early rap-metal band T9. Ilchi moved to Beijing when he was 12 years old and in 2004, he co-founded the band Hanggai with ethnic Mongolian musicians, including the morin khuur (horse-head fiddle) player, Batubagan, and vocalist-guitarist Yalalt. Hanggai, the Mongolian term for a place with beautiful pastures, mountains and rivers, is known for combining Mongolian folk music with modern styles. And they have appeared on the international stage, including the Fuji Rock and WOMAD (World of Music, Arts and Dance) festivals. In 2010, they launched their own world music festival in Beijing. Giving his take on the project, Ilchi says: ""I grew up on the grasslands and I lived a nomadic lifestyle before I moved to the big city at 12. ""So, what we want to express is the musical influence we got from our ethnic background, which makes us unique. ""The spiritual strength of our culture is important to us. We feel we have a responsibility to continue promoting and updating it."" Contact the writer at chennan@chinadaily.com.cn"
0,"Beijing authorities have banned fireworks inside the city due to their effects on air pollution and the casualties caused by fireworks in recent years.  According to the regulation, passed on Friday by the standing committee of the Beijing Municipal People's Congress, fireworks are banned within the Fifth Ring Road, and district authorities outside the Fifth Ring Road can set areas where fireworks are banned or restricted.  In restricted areas outside the Fifth Ring Road, fireworks are allowed only on the eve and the first day of the Lunar New Year, as well as from 7 am to midnight from the second day to the 15th day of the Lunar New Year.  National and municipal celebrations and holidays that require official fireworks displays will be approved and announced by the Beijing municipal government.  Previously, setting off fireworks within Beijing's Fifth Ring Road was allowed only at Lunar New Year and the Lantern Festival.  ""To prevent accidents, like fires and injuries, I support the ban. Although fireworks play an important role in China to celebrate weddings and festivals, there are other options, such as environmentally friendly fireworks, which contain no sulfur and produce less smoke,"" said Song Qi, an IT programmer in Beijing.  On Sina Weibo, a netizen named ""Tutu"" said that some residents living inside the Fifth Ring Road may feel sad about not seeing fireworks during the Spring Festival and suggested the government hold public fireworks shows.  ""Policies can be put in place to make people who set off fireworks responsible for other's injuries. If people don't follow the rules, they should be harshly punished,"" Tutu said.  According to an official with the legal affairs office of the Beijing municipal government, dozens of people were injured or killed in fireworks-related accidents during the Lunar New Year periods between 2015 and 2017.  There was several days of heavy air pollution during the festival in each of the past five years, the official said.  In 2011, the capital's fire department banned fireworks within 60 meters of residential buildings of more than 10 stories and commercial buildings over 24 meters high during the Lantern Festival. It was the first time Beijing had implemented a fireworks ban since the city held the 2008 Olympic Games.  In 2013, firework celebrations were banned in Beijing during periods when serious air pollution was forecast.  Xinhua contributed to this story.  yangwanli@chinadaily.com.cn"
0,"Latest: The Ministry of Culture and Tourism said it has started investigations into the hotels and has instructed its branches in five provinces and municipalities to investigate, including Shanghai, Beijing, Fujian, Jiangxi and Guizhou, Xinhuanet reported on Friday. In response to a viral video that exposed the shoddy cleaning practices of 14 luxury hotels in China, the government’s health departments in Shanghai and Beijing, where most of these disgraced hotels are located, dispatched inspection teams on Thursday to perform a thorough inspection. Health officials in Beijing's Dongcheng, Haidian and Chaoyang districts collected samples from the four hotels shown in the video for examination. Test results will be made public. The Beijing Municipal Commission of Tourism Development summoned managers of the four hotels for an inquiry on Thursday, ordering them to verify the video. If the claims were true, the hotels should rectify their hygiene work in a fixed period of time. The 11-minute video, titled “The Secrets of Cups”, was produced and uploaded onto Sina Weibo on Wednesday night by a famous Chinese blogger who goes by the username Hua Zong Diu Le Jin Gu Bang. Within 12 hours of its release, the video was viewed more than 13 million times, sparking heated discussions in print and online media.  Hotels mentioned in the video include the Waldorf Astoria Shanghai, the recently opened Bulgari Hotel Shanghai, Park Hyatt Beijing and the Aman Summer Palace Luxury Resort in Beijing. A night at any of these hotels cost at least 1,500 yuan ($216). The video showed that housekeepers from these hotels have been cleaning mugs used for drinking or brushing teeth with used towels or the same cloth that is used to wipe toilet seats.  Park Hyatt Beijing and Shangri-la Hotel Fuzhou, which were among the 14 hotels featured in the video, issued apology letters by Thursday noon, saying that they would conduct additional training or self-checks, according to Shanghai-based Chinese media The Paper."
1,"Chinese companies are scrambling to gain a lead in the race to commercialize 5G－or the next-generation mobile communication technology－as the country evolves from being a follower into a pioneering player in the global telecoms arena. The super-fast 5G network is expected to allow consumers to download an 8-gigabit movie in seconds and help to make autonomous driving a reality, causing ripples across most industries and sectors in a new internet revolution. The mobile technology is so important that it was highlighted in the government work report delivered by Premier Li Keqiang during this year's National People's Congress session in March. A report by the China Academy of Information and Communication Technology predicted that 5G will drive 6.3 trillion yuan ($946.8 billion) of economic output in the country by 2030. China Mobile Communications Corp, the world's largest telecoms carrier by subscribers, said it aims to deploy more than 10,000 5G base stations by 2020 and aims to launch a pre-commercial 5G service in 2018. Last November, the Beijing-based company outgunned foreign rivals to lead the global 5G System Architecture project, which it said will determine the ""structure of 5G networks"". It came shortly after polar coding, a technology backed by Chinese telecoms equipment maker Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, was approved as part of the global standards for 5G.   ""The progress highlights the rising influence of Chinese companies in the global telecommunications arena,"" said Xiang Ligang, CEO of telecoms industry website Cctime. ""It is a recognition of both their technological prowess and their brand influence."" Currently, 5G standards are still under development by 3GPP, or the 3rd Generation Partnership Project, which promotes global wireless communications standards. But the body announced it will accelerate the process and lock down the first version of global 5G standards around June in 2018－signaling that little change would be expected to current technical specifications and vendors can get to work on standardized 5G equipment, experts said. To pounce on the opportunities, China is rushing to finish its own series of 5G trials. The country's telecoms authority said in November that the country has started the third phase of 5G technical tests, as it aims to get pre-commercial 5G products ready as soon as possible. Wen Ku, director of the telecoms development department at the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, said developments will be ramped up. Wen said more efforts will be made to accelerate tests on network planning, systems, chips and other products in the industrial chain, which will help to lay down a sound foundation for the fast development of a 5G network in China. The country has already established the world's largest 5G test field in Huairou district, Beijing, where about 30 telecom base stations were built and China Mobile, Huawei, ZTE Corp and a string of foreign tech companies have finished China's second phase of 5G research and development tests.   To accelerate the path to 5G, MIIT also detailed frequency bands－both low, medium and high frequencies are involved－for the development of the super-fast networks in China. ""A frequency band is as important to telecoms carriers as land is in the real estate industry,"" said Fu Liang, an independent telecom analyst. ""Specifying the designated frequency band for 5G tests will motivate enterprises to channel resources to that band, thus promoting faster development."" Companies are also building up massive financial resources to exploit the opportunities that will come. US investment bank Jefferies said China's mobile carriers will invest at least $173 billion in 5G construction from 2019-25, an increase of 48 percent on the total spend on 4G from 2013-20. ""5G will no longer be a simple technology or system,"" said Huang Yuhong, deputy head of the China Mobile Research Institute. ""Instead, it is a platform in which the telecoms industry needs to be deeply linked with other sectors. That is a fundamental difference between 5G and 4G."""
0,"A music teacher is working to make the ancient Chinese zither popular with young people. Chen Nan reports. The world premiere of seven musical pieces by Chinese composers was at the concert Music Contemporary From China 2018 at Alice Tully Hall of the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York in late January. The composers are all faculty members of the Beijing-based Central Conservatory of Music. The piece, also performed by musicians from the conservatory, featured both traditional Chinese instruments and Western instruments. ""The new works have different styles and guzheng (Chinese zither) is capable of making versatile sounds,"" says Ji Wei, a player of the instrument and an associate professor at the Central Conservatory of Music. ""I was very excited and couldn't wait to share the new music with the audience in the United States,"" Ji says of her preparations in Beijing before the concert of Jan 27. Ji, 39, began to learn the ancient plucked instrument as a child and recalls how audiences were curious about guzheng when she first performed abroad in Japan and the United States in the early 1990s. ""Even while I was in an elevator with my guzheng placed next to me, people who entered the elevator would ask me about it,"" Ji says. Now, she says more composers are interested in the instrument and are willing to write music for it, which has kept guzheng alive as well as expanded its repertoire in recent times. Before the concert in New York, Ji had performed with the Vienna University Philharmonic at the Musikverein in Vienna on Dec 11 in a concert, which was the European premiere of composer Vijay Upadhyaya's new work, the 75-minute Chang'an Men. Upadhyaya, an Indian-born, Vienna-based composer was commissioned to produce the piece by the China National Symphony Orchestra.,Speaking about Ji, Upadhyaya says: ""She is one of the most accomplished and professional guzheng players in China and the world. I was lucky to have her as a soloist in my composition. Actually, I needed to consult her sometimes regarding the technical details of the instrument while composing."" Meanwhile, the Chinese musician has been delving into traditional music as well as finding new sounds for her instrument. Speaking about her work, Ji says: ""What I want to do is to display the beauty of the instrument by playing classic guzheng pieces, such as A Moonlit Night on the Spring River, The Evening Song of Fishermen, High Mountain and Flowing Water, and to bring the modern side of the instrument to people, who may have ignored its potential."" In 2005, Ji made history when the classical recording label Deutsche Grammophon published its first-ever guzheng piece At Night on the Lake Beneath the Maple Bridge, featuring her performance with world-renowned Chinese pianist Lang Lang. Ji has also recorded dozens of solo albums and has authored textbooks and played with top ensembles around the globe. Born in Shijiazhuang, Hebei province, Ji started to learn to play the instrument at the age of 5 at a local art training school as her working-class parents wanted their only child to receive art education. Then, the guzheng was not commonly seen in cities in China. ""The instrument was expensive and my mother drew the strings of guzheng on a piece of paper for me to practice at home. I could only play the real guzheng at the school,"" recalls Ji. ""For me, a shy young girl then, the instrument was very expressive."" In 1992, she was admitted to the middle school attached to the China Conservatory of Music in Beijing and Wang Zhongshan, one of the best-known guzheng musicians, was her teacher. After graduation she obtained her master's degree from the Central Conservatory of Music in 2004 before starting to teach there. Ji was interested in blending the traditional instrument with modern sounds even as a student. ""I am interested in working with musicians of different styles and that's the best way to promote guzheng as well as discovering the potential of the instrument through collaboration,"" says Ji, who has participated in workshops held by international conservatories. Before her master's degree was complete, Ji was invited to perform in a concert with French electronic music artist Jean Michel Jarre at the Forbidden City in Beijing. To popularize the instrument among the young, Ji initiated a guzheng ensemble in 2008, which has since gathered students from the Central Conservatory of Music and gives performances at venues like the National Centre for the Performing Arts and Beijing Concert Hall. ""I decided to become a teacher when I was a young student. I want to inspire my students, too. It can be very exciting to challenge them to find something new while remaining rooted in traditional Chinese music,"" she says."
0,"Indian and Chinese artists get together to present a piece inspired by classical kathak and modern dance in Beijing, Chen Nan reports.  She spins around and around really fast with her long, black braided hair spinning in the air and her hands gesturing up and down.  ""It's all about the center point. All the movements start and return to the center point of the body,"" gasps Mitul Sengupta, a 35-year-old Indian dancer-choreographer, who displays a movement of kathak, a major Indian classical dance form, at the theater of Beijing Dance/LDTX.  This is part of her latest choreography work, titled  which will be staged at Beijing's Tianqiao Performing Arts Center on Friday and will travel to Taiyuan in Shanxi province on Monday.  The work is the first collaborative project between Rhythmosaic-Sengupta Dance Company, which was founded by Sengupta 10 years ago along with her husband, Ronnie Shambik Ghose, who graduated from the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts with a major in musical theater dance, and Beijing Dance/LDTX, which was founded by Willy Tsao in 2005.  Choreographed by the couple, Tsao and Ma Bo, the latter a veteran dancer of Beijing Dance/LDTX,   features more than 20 dancers from China and India. The music contains traditional instruments of both countries, such as the sitar and   (Chinese zither).  The costumes feature white and black not only to match the title of the work, but also to express the vibrancy of other colors through contrast, such as yellow and green, which was the idea of the participating Indian artists.  When it premiered at Calcutta Club, a well-known heritage venue in the Indian city of Kolkata, in December 2015,  was staged five times, drawing more than 5,000 people.  ""The response of the audience was fantastic. This is a production to strengthen the bond and cultural heritage of the two ancient countries, which share lots of similarities and a long history of friendship,"" says Oindrilla Dutt, the curator and initiator of the project.  She named the dance work   to symbolize ""peace, unity and the flowing of time"".  Dutt, who is an experienced curator of the arts, got to know Sengupta and Ghose about a decade ago and offered them their first break onstage in India.  ""Sengupta has had strong training in Indian classical dance from a very young age and Ghose has been trained in jazz, classical ballet and modern dance,"" Dutt says, adding that the couple are open to fusion of traditional and contemporary dance moves, which made their experiment with a Chinese modern dance company possible.  In 2014, Dutt came to Beijing along with the couple and dancers from the Rhythmosaic-Sengupta Dance Company to perform at the Beijing Dance Festival, an annual event launched by Tsao in 2008 to promote modern dance in the Chinese capital by bringing international contemporary dance troupes here as well as showcasing local talents.  According to Sengupta, it was her company's first trip to China and the first time for an Indian dance company to perform at the festival. The program they presented was titled Desolate - The Voices of the Trapped, which blends kathak with contemporary dance.  ""We were impressed by the young Chinese dancers' techniques and along with Willy Tsao, we developed the idea of producing a dance piece to celebrate the diversity of both countries, which is based on the languages of kathak and contemporary dance forms,"" says Sengupta.  In 2012, the couple worked with French dancer-choreographer Gianin Loringett, giving a modern twist to Tchaikovsky's classic ballet, Swan Lake. Titled Swan Lake Revisited, the work was a fusion of classical ballet and kathak.  ""Like technology keeps progressing, modern dance also develops fast, and one of the most important factors is to learn and be inspired from a different culture,"" says Tsao who runs three major modern dance companies in China.  ""This collaboration opens our vision for modern dance. These artists showed us that Indian dance can be both very traditional and very modern.""  Calling the experience both challenging and rewarding, Dutt says dance is universal, which is all about breaking down barriers.  ""This is an exciting time to be an artist. In the past, there was a strong division of different forms of arts, but now artists can combine the arts together for independent expression,"" says Dutt."
1,"BEIJING - With dignitaries flocking to the Swiss resort of Davos from every corner of the globe, the World Economic Forum (WEF) offers a once-a-year opportunity for the international community to debate on how to forge ahead with plans to revive global economy. The theme of this year's economic jamboree - ""Creating a Shared Future in a Fractured World"" - echoes Chinese President Xi Jinping's vision of ""Building a Community with a Shared Future for Mankind."" Scholars and political figures consider the vision as a guide for the world to pursue future economic development to achieve common prosperity. Michael Moller, director general of the UN Office at Geneva, said this year's WEF theme has ""an organic"" link to what Xi said. ""It was a new movement and new positioning of China that was extremely welcome at the time when the world was fragmented, when we had many problems of different kinds,"" he said. ""The rest of the world is coming to follow the president's words last year,"" he said. ""We are seeing more and more renewed international solidarity."" According to British scholar Martin Jacques, a professor at University of Cambridge, China has provided a new possibility, that is, abandoning the law of the jungle, hegemonism and power politics and the zero-sum game and replacing them with win-win cooperation and co-construction and sharing. This is unprecedented pioneering work and a great creation to change the world. Peter Thomson, president of the 71st session of the UN General Assembly, said building a community with a shared future for mankind ""to me is the only future for humanity on this planet."" Xi made a keynote speech entitled   at WEF one year ago. The speech pointed out that in the face of both opportunities and challenges of economic globalization, the right thing to do is to seize every opportunity, jointly meet challenges and chart the right course for economic globalization. ""We should commit ourselves to growing an open global economy to share opportunities and interests through opening-up and achieve win-win outcomes,"" Xi said. One day after he made the WEF speech, Xi spoke to an audience at the UN Geneva Office, elaborating his ideas of building a community with a shared future for mankind. ""We should build an open and inclusive world through exchanges and mutual learning,"" Xi said. ""We should make our world clean and beautiful by pursuing green and low-carbon development."" Moller said he had recommended that many people read these two speeches made by President Xi, according to People's Daily, the official newspaper of the Communist Party of China (CPC). He said the messages contained in the two speeches have clearly presented the world the policy direction of the Chinese government, which means a huge step towards the common goals set by the world. This year at WEF in Davos, Liu He, a senior Chinese official, elaborated the top-level planning of China's economic policy for the next few years. Liu, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and director of the General Office of the Central Leading Group for Financial and Economic Affairs, pledged that China will open wider to the world. In his speech, Liu stressed the necessity to shift the Chinese economy from a phase of rapid growth to one of high-quality development. Such a transition, he said, is the context in which China formulates its macroeconomic, structural, reform and social policies in the coming years. He said China will further integrate with international trade rules and ease market access. China will also substantially open up the services sector, the financial sector in particular, and create a more attractive investment environment. Over the past year, China has also been working hard to turn the vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind into actions. In May, 2017, China hosted the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation to expand the circle of friends for the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative. Over 100 countries and international development organizations including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund participated in the forum in Beijing. The Leaders Roundtable of the forum produced a communique which strongly denounced protectionism, saying ""we endeavor to promote a universal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system with WTO at its core."" In September, China hosted the ninth BRICS summit in the southeastern city of Xiamen, Fujian province. A declaration issued following the meetings of the five major emerging economies - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, said: ""We emphasize the importance of an open and inclusive world economy enabling all countries and peoples to share the benefits of globalization."" Moreover, the 19th CPC National Congress, held in Beijing in October, set building a community with a shared future for mankind and building a new type of international relations as an overall goal of China's diplomacy. These endeavors initiated by China have once again demonstrated China's commitment to building an open economy, ensuring free and inclusive trade worldwide and sharing benefits with other countries."

The inspection is part of a citywide campaign by the Beijing Food and Drug Administration that aims to ensure the safety of food for students in the fall semester and the safety of those preparing it. School canteens as well as restaurants and supermarkets close to schools are the main targets. Haichunge was ordered rectify the problem ahead of another inspection on Friday. The canteen at Beijing No 4 High School and the nearby Sun Market were also inspected, with no irregularities found. The sanitary state of kitchens and canteens - such as tableware disinfection and the preservation of cold dishes - is a focus of the inspection. The monthlong examination started on Monday and will finish on Sept 28, the administration said."
0,"The majority of fake stories shared on the Chinese internet involve food safety or give health advice, an online information verification team set up by tech giant Tencent said on Wednesday. Fact Check, a platform that analyzes online rumors, released a list of the top 10 online rumors that duped Chinese netizens since April last year. Eight related to people's health－especially the safety of food and medicine. In February, for example, a video that included claims that seaweed containing plastic was being sold in China made the rounds on the internet. The video was quickly proved false by the Center for Food Safety Risk Assessment in Beijing, according to the platform, yet it still resulted in a nearly 100 million yuan loss ($14.7 million) to the seaweed industry in Fujian province. ""Netizens are easily attracted by health information online and like to forward it to friends or family members,"" said Wang Yang, an employee responsible for the platform at Tencent, the company behind WeChat. Wang's team tabulated more than 2,000 pieces of false information from 2.2 million WeChat users this year, finding that around 45 percent related to health and 16 percent to food safety. ""Many netizens who forwarded such fake health information are over 60 years old and not well-educated,"" she said. Another survey of 70,000 netizens by the team echoed those results. The platform listed 10 popular but false online rumors over the past year, finding that people over 60 years old had the highest chance of being tricked－as high as 33.8 percent. ""To prevent older netizens from being duped by fake information, we started to cooperate with food and medicine administrations this year, hoping to post authorized responses and verify the information in a timely manner,"" Wang said. Kou Fei, 29, an employee of a Beijing educational institute, said her parents often send or forward health-related information, ""but sometimes I cannot distinguish fake ones, as I don't have much scientific knowledge"". Beijing's cybersecurity authority said it has created a system, with several internet companies, to identify fake information online using key words to clean rumors in a timely manner."

These three paintings are among 50 works by young Chinese artists being showcased at the 2017 Eye Art International Youth Exhibition at Penn Wharton China Center in Beijing on Saturday. Being energetic and creative, young artists in China are expressing their identity through their paintings, dances and music. Their youth gives them a fresh take on the world and relationships. Personal experiences, social changes in China and Western culture have all influenced their creations and distinguished them from their predecessors. Veteran artists, intangible culture heritage inheritors and experts in the art field and auction company were invited to give advice to young artists at a small workshop after the opening ceremony of the exhibition. Wang Chunchen, a professor at Central Academy of Fine Art, encouraged young people to be braver and break new ground. ""To young artists, the priority is to do the things they like. 'I want, I like and then I create',"" Wang said. ""Never ask if your creation is art or not, just do it."" Zhang Zhongqiang, the only inheritor of making clay rabbits for Mid-Autumn Day in Beijing said he want to find what young artists like from these showpieces. And he worried that young Chinese artists would not appreciatetraditional crafts. Organized by Eye Art International, the exhibition aims to promote expression, dialogue and understanding of world cultures through exhibitions and art activities. The show in Beijing will run until April 29 and will tour Israel and New York later in the year."
1,"China and the United States reached a consensus on some issues during their high-level trade talks on Thursday and Friday in Beijing, said Xinhua News Agency. Vice-Premier Liu He, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, carried out frank, efficient and constructive discussions on China-US economic and trade issues with the delegation led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, visiting as US President Donald Trump's special envoy. Both parties believe that healthy and stable Sino-US economic and trade relations are very important to the two countries, and both are committed to solving relevant economic and trade issues through dialogue and consultation. The two sides fully exchanged views on expanding US exports to China, bilateral service trade, two-way investment, the protection of intellectual property rights, and the settlement of tariff and nontariff measures. In some areas, some consensus has been reached. Both parties recognize that there are still major differences on some issues and they need to continue to intensify their work and make more progress. The two sides agreed to establish a communication mechanism and maintain close communications. China made solemn representations to the US side regarding the case of ZTE Corporation, said a spokesman of the Ministry of Commerce. The US side expressed that they will pay attention to these representations and will report China's position to the president of the United States."
1,"Tianjin will give top priority to industrial restructuring as part of the ongoing efforts by the northern port city to sustain annual GDP growth. Tianjin's renewed focus came after its GDP growth fell to 3.6 percent last year from double-digit growth in the preceding years. During the first six months of this year, the city's GDP edged up by 1.5 percentage points compared with the first quarter, growing 3.4 percent to reach 992.7 billion yuan ($145.7 billion), showing signs of a slight recovery. Decluttering Beijing's industries and trying to transfer competitive sectors including intelligent sectors, part of the efforts to implement the synergic development strategy for Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei province, is now a key effort to restructure Tianjin's industrial layout. The effort is expected to pay off to help reverse Tianjin's downward GDP and the city revealed an ambitious target to build itself into an ""intelligent coastal port"", said Sun Hujun, deputy head of Tianjin Municipal Development and Reform Commission. A prime example is the Tianjin Economic and Technological Development Area (TEDA), which has attracted 238 Beijing companies during the first half with contractual investment value of up to 74.2 billion yuan. According to Zheng Weiming, director of the administrative committee of TEDA, the area is highly ""selective"" in its industrial transfer campaign as it wants to ensure quality GDP growth. As a result, most of the firms in the area are from central State-owned companies, and also include emerging intelligence projects from JD and Baidu. Zheng, however, admitted that, despite the selective approach, the area logged the highest GDP growth in the city of 7.3 percent. Liu Gang, director of Economic Research Institute at Nankai University in Tianjin, indicated that the city s' previous economy was highly dependent on investment and heavy industries. But it needs to move on to a new path driven by smart technology upgrading, he added. ""China has strong demand to boost intelligent industries and Tianjin can cater to the demand by helping move industries from Beijing,"" he said. To this end, the city unveiled a package of polices in mid-June, ranging from enterprises' smart upgrading, cutting-edge internet transformation, as well as development in robotics, integrated circuit, software, information services to big data sectors. Each relevant project could hit up to 50 million yuan and there are no limits for eligible companies to seek funding."
1,"China aims to boost rural entrepreneurship and take up farming as a decent profession, as it steps up efforts to invigorate its vast countryside. Beijing will establish a ""professional farmer"" system to lure talents, from rural workers to urban dwellers, to embark on agricultural-related businesses, said Han Changfu, minister of agriculture and rural affairs. ""We will accelerate the cultivation of new types of agricultural entities and bolster scalable agricultural operations,"" Han told a panel discussion during the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2018 on Monday. ""Meanwhile, we should guide, support and encourage a variety of talents to return or come to the countryside and start their own business,"" he said, adding that concrete measures are still underway. The strategy of rural vitalization was first proposed as one of the major aspects of developing a modernized economy and lifting its residents out of poverty by 2020. ""The ultimate goal is to make 'farming' an attractive and promising profession that is not placed at an inferior social ranking,"" Han said. To increase the allure of the countryside, China will strive to make the agricultural industry more efficient and competitive, by better integrating primary, secondary and tertiary industries and strengthening environmental protection. To narrow the rural-urban divide, the government will rebalance policies to prioritize the development of infrastructure building and the introduction of basic social services. The private sector has a role to play in boosting rural entrepreneurship. China's leading agribusiness company New Hope Group has budgeted 50 billion yuan ($7.9 billion) in five years to invest in a comprehensive network that produces, sells, and promotes high-quality agricultural produce, said its chairman Liu Yonghao. Over the same period, the company also plans to train over 200,000 farm owners and agricultural technicians to equip them with e-commerce and other technological knowhow to jumpstart and expand their businesses. ""Some rural areas are over-urbanized, with young and fit rural workers leaving village homes and towns for cities thanks to better pay,"" Liu said. ""By modernizing agricultural production, we want to turn 'farming' into a name tag that people are proud of,"" he said. Through its Rural Taobao initiative, e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd is helping to raise living standards in the countryside by providing e-commerce access for millions of poorer residents through 30,000 local service centers, according to Wang Jian, Alibaba's chairman of Technology Steering Committee. Besides, the company is enlisting thousands of mom-wand-pop convenience stores in counties and townships with software that uses data analytics to predict sales and manage inventory, he said."
0,"The number of people travelling between the Chinese mainland and Ireland could increase by as much as 300 percent once the countries are linked by regular direct flights in June. Hainan Airlines will begin flying between Beijing and Dublin on June 12. Vincent Harrison, managing director of Dublin Airport, said: ""Once a long-haul service is in place, there will be two times the volume of passenger growth, and sometimes it could be three times depending on the market."" Harrison said around 120,000 passengers travelled between the two countries last year and that Ireland is the most popular destination in Europe for Chinese travellers that does not currently have a direct flight. The direct link adds convenience and will allow people to travel much more frequently on business and more easily for leisure, boosting passenger numbers, he said. Hainan Airlines will operate flights from Dublin to Beijing four times per week. On two days per week, the service will be direct nonstop flights between Dublin and Beijing. The other two days, the flights will also stop in Edinburgh. The possibility of flying directly to Ireland will generate publicity and interest in China. ""If no Chinese airline is flying to Ireland, people are not talking about Ireland or promoting it, but as soon as they start presenting that as an option, things will be different,"" Harrison said. Meanwhile, 10 days ahead of the first Dublin to Beijing route, Cathay Pacific is to launch a new direct Dublin-Hong Kong service four times per week, starting on June 2. Tourism Ireland estimates that about 70,000 Chinese visitors visited the island last year, up from 60,000 in 2016. Mary Rose Burke, CEO of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, said: ""People in China may not understand how excited we are in Dublin and Ireland about the direct flight both to Beijing and Hong Kong. ""It opens up people's imagination of what might be possible in a huge way. There is a huge sense of goodwill, excitement and romance. I think it is important to capture some of that because decisions are made on business in an economic way, but also made around emotion and connection and ease of doing business."" According to Kieran Donoghue, global head of International Financial Services, Strategy and Public Policy at IDA Ireland, trade between Ireland and China in 2017 was worth more than 14.9 billion euros ($18.45 billion), double the figure from 2013. He believes the new direct route will greatly facilitate Irish firms and exporters with operations and clients in China, as well as China's financial services and technology companies investing in Ireland. Donohue said Ireland will be a ""large alternative"" to the UK for Chinese investors in the aftermath of Brexit. ""Ireland looks like the largest alternative for Chinese investors because we have effectively the same legal system as the UK, we're English-speaking and we preserve the market access,"" he said."
0,"Miyun reservoir, Beijing's major water storage site, has completed construction of a 400-kilometer protective fence around the area. Regulations forbid visitors from entering the reservoir area－located about 120 km northeast of the city center－and no fishing or recreational uses are allowed. Still, many people continue to enter the area secretly to swim, enjoy the view or fish. To ensure the water's quality and protect the environment, the government created a conservation zone in 2016 and began building a chain-link fence around it. ""The fence project is complete, and the daily operation department will now take over,"" said Zhang Hua, an official in Miyun's water bureau. He said the bureau is working on developing a video monitoring system to strengthen reservoir management. Meanwhile, the authority formed a water protection team of 1,200 staff members to guard the reservoir. There are also people working at the 230 entrances and exits in the area 24 hours a day to prevent intrusions. Miyun reservoir, with a surface area of 180 square kilometers and a capacity of 4 billion cubic meters, was built in 1960. It's the largest artificial lake in Asia. A road 110 km long around the lake is one of the most popular scenic spots in suburban Beijing. On Nov 19, water volume in the reservoir reached 2 billion cubic meters, the highest level this century. Zheng Huaijiang, a resident of Xiwengzhuang county, said he moved out of his hometown with other villagers in 1958 to make way for the reservoir. In 1994, they gave up fish farming with the aim of protecting the ecology. ""I'm happy to see the reservoir reach 2 billion cubic meters,"" Zheng said. ""Our village has sacrificed several times for the reservoir, but we don't have any complaints."" With spring having arrived, many migratory birds are coming to the area. Zhang Xiaozheng, deputy chief of the reservoir protection team, has been working at the reservoir for 20 years. The number and types of migratory birds have increased in recent years, which means that the natural environment and the water quality are improving, he said."

Recently during his Beijing visit to promote the upcoming crime thriller which will hit Chinese mainland theaters on Sept 30, the 63-year-old actor reveals he has enjoyed performing stunts on the sets. When the film was shot in Thailand, he was suspended in the air, and was ""thrown out"" twice to perform some stunts that he believes he had done ""perfectly"". ""I've got old injuries, which initially made me uncomfortable. But after I took off my coat, I felt relaxed,"" says Chow. The film, directed by Felix Chong,and also featuring Hong Kong singer-actor Aaron Kwok, follows a counterfeiting gang. The other members of the cast are actress Zhang Jingchu, Taiwan actor David Wang and Hong Kong actor Alex Fong Chung-sun."

Under the plan, a project database will be set up to help facilitate lending to key projects this year in the region, said an official document. Such efforts come as the central government intends to ease the mega-city syndrome of the capital, ease congestion and integrate regional economies for more balanced development. By the end of 2020, around 1,000 manufacturing industries and 300 logistics centers in Beijing will be either shut down or relocated to nearby places, as part of efforts to relocate Beijing's non-capital functions, according to Liu Bozheng, deputy head of Beijing coordinated development office."
1,"As the wanderlust of China's vast middle class takes wing and targets choicest international destinations, tourist hot spots such as Hawaii are seeing multitudes of Chinese travelers. Small wonder, Hawaiian Airlines, which already operates direct flights between Beijing and Honolulu three times a week, plans to launch more direct flights to connect Shanghai and smaller Chinese cities with Hawaii. Leading the expansion strategy is Liwei Kimura, Hawaiian Airlines' regional director and chief representative for Greater China. Since taking charge in June 2015, Kimura has been flying frequently between Beijing and Honolulu. She is bullish on the growth potential of Hawaiian tourism on the back of rising Chinese interest in the Pacific islands. ""We are a premier leisure carrier as our destination is a place for relaxation and fun. Vacations for such purposes have become an essential part of high-quality Chinese lifestyle. I'm confident there's a big market for us in China,"" Kimura said. Grown up in Beijing, Kimura brings insider knowledge of local tastes and preferences to the airline's strategy. For instance, in May, the airline renovated the cabin of the plane used for the Beijing-Honolulu flight, to highlight certain elements in design and layout. When Chinese fliers stepped into the cabin, they apparently felt as if they were in Hawaii already, more so because the flight attendants wear traditional Hawaiian flowers. The business class was equipped with seats that allow customers to lie down fully. This was done to meet the expectations of affluent Chinese travelers who are willing to pay more for comfort and quality service during long flights. ""Our seats look fashionable and use ergonomic design. Besides, we don't use the traditional on-air entertainment system for business class anymore. Instead, we hand in every customer an iPad. ""We offer all this at flight ticket prices that are the same or comparable to our competitors', and we aim to provide more exquisite services at the same price points,"" she said. Kimura's emphasis on style in the airline's customized approach to the China market is also evident in her sartorial elegance. For this interview in Beijing, she is dressed in a purple  a classic Chinese dress. That color is significant. ""Purple represents honor in Hawaii. If something is purple, it means it's honorable. The symbolic meaning is the same as in China. Hawaiian Airlines even innovated its logo with heavier use of purple."" The China-Hawaii style fusion extends to her  's floral patterns, which are based on traditional Hawaiian flowers. That's not all.   Kimura's earrings are purple-hued, and a purple flower on the left side of the parting of her hair completes the chic look. ""I've a lot of flowers in different colors to match my clothes, and I'd wear them when I'm in the mood. It doesn't have to be any formal occasion. ""When a flower is on the left side, it means the woman is married. If it's on the right side, it means she is still available."" That feminine wisdom helps her to tap into her natural talent and self-confidence, and shapes her management style, which, she said, can be described in one word－empowerment. That is, empowerment of her team, her employer, the airline's customers, staff and stakeholders. The key to that is honest, open and timely communications, she said. ""I'm trying to bring what I've learned in my life journey to my team."" She believes that though people complain about even little problems, ""every negative thing can be turned"" into a positive outcome or a positive start for something new eventually. Her 20-plus years of experience in the travel and hospitality industry are peppered with instances of negatives being converted into positives, she said. Kimura began her career at Great Wall Sheraton in Beijing, the first Western hotel that opened in modern China. In 1999, she left China and went to Hawaii to pursue an MBA from the University of Hawaii, where she majored in international management with focus on China. After graduation, she worked at Starwood Hotels & Resorts in Hawaii before joining Hawaiian Airlines. Her family is based in Hawaii, where they own a house, and Kimura relies on constant communications for work-life balance. ""We're really an international family. I try to communicate with my family members through social media. The physical distance makes every moment we spend together a treasure for us. When we are together, it's quality time, and I find that very gratifying."" Equally gratifying for her is the airline's record. For the past 13 years, Hawaiian Airlines has been rated as the most punctual US airline, according to the US Department of Transportation. Last year, it was named the most punctual airline globally by the UK-based air travel intelligence company OAG. The OAG Punctuality League, covering about 200 airlines, revealed that 89.9 percent of Hawaiian's flights arrived on time in 2016. Kimura said every department and staff member of Hawaiian Airlines values the importance of safety and punctuality. They have become important parts of the corporate culture, something that Chinese travelers have come to expect from the airline, she said."
0,"BEIJING -- Beijing will introduce mandatory garbage sorting rules at schools, hospitals, office buildings, tourist attractions and hotels, according to the Standing Committee of Beijing Municipal People's Congress, the local legislature, on Wednesday. Major progress has been achieved in garbage sorting in Beijing, said Zhang Jiaming, the city's deputy mayor. A total of 1,064 schools, 271 hospitals, 528 supermarkets and shopping malls, and 446 tourist attractions have carried out garbage sorting. However, it will still take some efforts to develop the habit of sorting waste for residents in Beijing, said Hao Zhilan with the Urban Construction and Environmental Protection Committee of the municipal people's congress. By the end of 2019, Beijing will also carry out garbage sorting and recycling rules in 500 villages and ensure 97 percent of household garbage in the villages is properly treated, said Zhang. Over 300 Chinese cities at or above the prefecture level will start household garbage sorting in 2019, according to an announcement by the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development in February."
0,"A growing number of families are sending children on study tours in foreign countries, as Zhao Xinying reports. Since September, when her daughter enrolled in primary school, Amy Chang has been researching study tours overseas. The Beijing resident had often considered sending the girl on a weeklong tour of foreign campuses, but had never taken any action, believing her daughter to be too young to deal with any problems she might encounter during a trip. ""She is now turning 7 and has been learning English for four years. I believe she could take care of herself and communicate with people effectively during a week overseas,"" Chang said. A growing number of parents are thinking the same way. A report published recently by online travel agency Ctrip shows that at least 800,000 overseas study tours were booked for Chinese children during the summer vacation, a 70 percent rise from the same period last year. Each tour cost an average of 25,000 yuan ($3,770) per person, and most were booked by middle-class families in large cities for pre-high school children, according to the report. About 13 percent were booked for children ages 3 to 6, while those ages 7 to 12 accounted for 31 percent. ""Because the kids learn things while travelling, many parents regard study tours as a good way of providing education through entertainment, which they believe will broaden their child's horizons and improve their language and communication skills,"" said Zhang Jie, director of the study tour department at Ctrip. While the United States and the United Kingdom have long dominated the list of popular destinations, countries in Africa, South America and Southeast Asia have been visited more frequently in recent years. Zhang Chao, general manager of a study tour agency in Nanning, Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, said a typical overseas tour lasts one to two weeks and consists of visits to prestigious schools and well-known scenic spots. He believes tours should supplement and expand what the students learn in class, and how they learn. For example, when the agency takes students to a museum overseas, it doesn't employ tour guides. ""Instead, we ask the kids to conduct their own research and explore the museum on their own, and then we ask them to introduce the area to each other. In this way, we help them to make full use of the tour to learn, and to improve their language skills,"" he said. Chang plans to send her daughter to the US for her first study tour, because the country has excellent primary schools where her daughter will be able to communicate in English and learn about the thoughts and lifestyles of foreign children of her own age. ""A trip like this might inspire her and could help her development,"" she said. Although a host of travel agencies and private educational institutions provide tours, Chang is considering a trip organized by her daughter's school, either during the upcoming winter vacation or next year's summer vacation. ""Compared with travel agencies or private organizations, I have more trust in the school's ability to ensure the children's safety and strike a good balance between study and travel,"" she said. ""The cost - about 30,000 to 40,000 yuan - is reasonable, and definitely within my budget."",Some wealthier parents are taking their children on study tours themselves. In September, Su An, a housewife in Beijing, took her 5-year-old son to Europe. Unlike many Chinese who head overseas for sightseeing and shopping, Su was motivated by her son's love of art. He has studied painting for two years, so she took him to museums and galleries, including the Louvre Museum in Paris and the Picasso Museum in Barcelona, Spain. Although the 10-day trip cost nearly 70,000 yuan, Su said it was worth it. ""Since returning, Ming Ming, my son, has often tried to make copies of the masterpieces he saw in Europe,"" she said, proudly, adding that she is planning another trip to consolidate his progress. ""His painting teacher told me that he has made the greatest progress ever since he came back from the tour,"" she said. Ming Ming said the paintings overseas were different to those he had seen in China."" They were beautiful,"" he said. ""I can't describe what the differences are, but I loved looking at them."" Su disagrees with people who think she wasted time and money because Ming Ming is too young to understand the things he saw. ""From my own experience, many things I read, saw and felt in my early childhood stayed in my memory for a long time,"" the 35-year-old said. ""So I believe that although my son did not fully understand or remember all the things he saw, some feelings he had during the trip will stay with him and influence him as he grows up."" However, not all parents - even high earners - are like Su, who is happy to absorb the cost of study tours. During the summer vacation, a WeChat article about a woman in Guangzhou, Guangdong province, who complained about the high cost of her daughter's education went viral thanks to its resonance among parents. The woman said she had spent 35,000 yuan on educational activities for the girl during the summer, with most of the expenditure related to a 10-day study tour in the US. Faced with rising peer pressure among other parents who spend generously on extracurricular education, the woman, a senior manager who earns more than 30,000 yuan a month, felt she had no choice but to splash out. As a result, she was forced to cut down on her own expenses - for example, she had to stop buying new clothes - and also had to work harder to earn more money to support her daughter's interests. Xiong Bingqi, deputy director of the 21st Century Education Research Institute in Beijing, said it's understandable that all parents try to help their children gain life advantages and study at all costs, but some fail to look at the matter rationally. ""They book very expensive tours for their children without fully considering the family's financial situation or the child's needs and interests. They just don't want to lose face with other parents,"" he said. ""Tours booked this way won't help a child's development. Instead, they are more likely to make the parents anxious and increase the financial burden on them."" Chu Zhaohui, a researcher at the National Institute of Education Sciences, said expensive overseas study tours can contribute to a child's development, but not as much as many parents imagine. ""Most study tours are quite short and may leave little impression on children, particularly younger kids,"" he said. ""Going on a study tour overseas is not a necessity for a child's development and could definitely be replaced with other activities. Parents needn't feel downhearted if they can't afford such tours."",Domestic tours Some parents actively avoid trying to ""keep up with the Joneses"", and are finding other ways to help their children. Wang Haifeng, who works for a State-owned enterprise, said rather than register her son, a sixth grader in Beijing, for an intensive, tiring study tour that requires travelling to a distant country, she would prefer he stayed at home to rest or participated in relaxing activities nearby. In August, she sent her son on a tour to Baiyangdian, Hebei province, with a dozen children of similar age. During the three-day trip, they conducted research into the quality of the local water. When he returned home, her son produced a report in which he detailed the things he had seen, felt and discovered on the tour. ""The trip cost just 1,000 yuan, but my son gained as much as he would have on a trip overseas, which might be 20 times more expensive,"" she said. A survey conducted by iResearch, a consultancy in Beijing, showed that children participated in 2.6 million domestic study tours last year. In December, the Ministry of Education, along with 10 other ministries and commissions, released a series of guidelines to encourage primary and middle schools to organize educational excursions for students. Many industry insiders saw it as an opportunity to further develop and tap the market potential.

1,"BEIJING - Two night bus tours will soon be available for the first time in Beijing for travelers hoping to discover the night life of the ancient Chinese capital. Three antique-style buses will run two circle routes from Beijing's Qianmen tourist transport center from Sunday, the Beijing Bus Group announced Wednesday. The eastern line will pass through many of Beijing's famous scenic spots including Chang'an Avenue, the Central Business District, Sanlitun and Guijie, a lively gourmet restaurant street, as well as Shichahai, one of Beijing's bar streets. The western line will stop at the Beijing Exhibition Center, the Central TV Tower, West Chang'an Avenue and Ping'an Street. The Central TV Tower is a 405 meter-high tower that provides views over the city. Two buses running eastward will leave Qianmen at 8:00 p.m. and 8:30 p.m., with tickets costing 30 yuan (4.4 U.S. dollars) per person, while the westbound bus will depart at 7:30 p.m. with a ticket price of 100 yuan.

0,"Dozens of small robots, driverless vehicles combined with express pickup containers, took to the streets for the first time from the Shangdi delivery station in northwest Beijing's Haidian district on Monday to improve delivery service and reduce costs. The red and white automated delivery robots stood in a shining line at 10 am on Monday around the Shangdi distribution center, one of e-commerce giant JD's main delivery stations. The driverless vehicles delivered 30 boxes of products, their top speed reaching 15 kilometers per hour. The robots, which automatically stop at red traffic lights, can carry up to 300 kilograms of goods. The deliveries ""covered most of the residential areas near the distribution station"", said Yang Jing, general manager of the autonomous vehicle center at JD's artificial intelligence technologies research department. Data on the machines were already on record with the Beijing Commission of Transportation's local transport department before they took to the road, Yang said. The robots, driving in the nonmotor-vehicle lanes, pick up goods left at local distribution centers by couriers. Navigating by radar and sensors, the robots avoid barriers and pedestrians, respond accordingly to traffic signals and make their way to the delivery sites. ""We are using delivery robots to reduce the human costs of traditional delivery service,"" Yang said. ""At the same time, it improves transportation efficiency."" A surveillance center monitors the vehicles' whereabouts through data and video the robots transmit. JD has already employed delivery machines in several closed areas, such as college campuses and closed off industrial communities. In June last year, robots delivered packages on the campus of Renmin University. JD plans to put more than 100 delivery robots in use in more than 20 Chinese and foreign cities, such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Xi'an and Bangkok. The company said on Tuesday that delivery efficiency will be greatly improved, but it gave no details on how robots will be integrated in the process. Liu Daizong, China transport program director at the World Resources Institute, said more guidelines are needed on how to operate unmanned vehicles on public streets. Especially if such vehicles are heavily loaded, ""crashes on the road could have huge consequences for pedestrians and cause damage,"" Liu said. Liu, an expert member of the Beijing Commission of Transportation, said so far Beijing has only set standards for unmanned vehicle road tests, and detailed guidelines need to be worked out. ""Standards still need to be tested, and less weight (than the 300 kg maximum) might be the safe option for the delivery robots,"" he added. Retail giant Amazon has also been using automated delivery robots, starting with drones at the end of 2016 in the UK to improve the transport efficiency."
1,"SANYA - A direct air route was launched on Thursday between Sanya, a famous tourist destination in South China's Hainan province, and London. The first flight departed from Sanya Phoenix International Airport at 1:00 pm Thursday Beijing time, and is scheduled to arrive at London Heathrow Airport at 6:45 pm local time. China Southern Airlines will operate the air service every Thursday and Sunday using an Airbus A330-200, with four first-class seats, 24 business class seats, and 187 economy class seats. Outbound flights will depart from Sanya at 1:15 pm Beijing time and arrive in London at 6:45 pm local time. Return flights will leave London at 10:10 pm local time and arrive in Sanya at 4:00 pm the next day. This is the first direct flight from Hainan to Europe in China's civil aviation industry. It is expected to promote the development of Hainan free trade zone and free trade port, said Wang Changshun, chairman of the airline. The island has become a favorite tropical resort for overseas tourists in recent years, with the number of foreign tourists exceeding 1.1 million in 2017, up nearly 50 percent year on year, according to the local tourism bureau. As of 2017, Hainan has 57 international air routes and is expected to add 16 more this year."
0,"Theatergoers with tickets to the current offering at the Beijing Exhibition Theater are in for a treat as a famed Chinese artistic troupe is back in town, opening its iconic show   with a new repertoire on Thursday. The music-and-dance variety show, produced by the China Disabled People's Performing Art Troupe, has just returned from a successful international tour that includes stops in New York, Ottawa, Montreal and Macau, with packed houses and resounding applause. At the Lincoln Center, UN General Assembly President María Fernanda Espinosa called the troupe's artists ""cultural ambassadors for goodwill among peoples"". In the decades since its inception in 2000, the show has never stopped reinventing itself in pursuit of greater professional excellence. New pieces are constantly added, as are new recruits, yet what remains unchanged over the years is the show's inspirational energy. The formula is unvarying as it's awe-inspiring: a juxtaposition of the artists' bewitchingly effortless brilliance and the insurmountable hurdles they must overcome to achieve that effect, as none in the audience is unaware of the fact that all the performers glittering on stage have impaired vision or hearing; some are even mentally or physically challenged. A group ballet dance coupled with a sign-language speech by the troupe's president, Tai Lihua, launched Thursday's revival of  . ""With such love and care, even a damaged tree provides green shady shelter, and even a broken flower gives off its fragrance,"" she said. There couldn't be a better summery of the show's essence, as it's indeed about love.,What followed immediately was   by Yang Haitao and his brother Yang Haijun, a soothing serenade that catapulted Haitao to national prominence when he performed it at the Bird’s Nest stadium for the 2008 Beijing Paralympics. The brothers barely moved once led on stage, their eyes unable to see the applauding multitude before them. Heads tilted upward expectantly, they started the tune: The voices were dulcet and becalming, their rendition of the song's longing evocative but never sentimental. It had an instant resonance that may be hard to explain, but is natural to blind artists bestowed with such beauty and dignity. The Yang brothers' performance was both humbling and inspiring to their audience as there was no mistaking its artistic value. That effect - dignity in restraint, yet therefore all the more dazzling - was just as true for the other performances.,There were group dances; some highly synchronized, like  others with complex sequences that required fluid transitions and interactions, like  . The visual impressions, however, were the same: if not for the conductors gesturing on the stage wings, you wouldn't know the prancing artists are deaf and must rely on sign language to cue their internalized rhythm and pace. The requisite discipline behind such theatrical splendor was never spoken aloud but was heard in the mind of every audience member.,More tunes were offered, including the nostalgic  a paean to hometown and mother, the all-time classic hymn Amazing Grace, and the ebullient sing-along, We Are the World. Blind pianist Jin Yuanhui played a solo, the C minor   by Chopin. Music Along the Silk Road, as the name implies, is a fest for folk musical instruments. There was also an excerpt from a dance drama,  a tragic tale of young love often conveniently - if a bit too summarily - referred to as China's .,Of course, by now it would be unthinkable if any revival of My Dream didn't include the troupe's signature sensation, the show-stopping  arguably the repertoire's most challenging piece. To recreate the Buddhist deity in its amorphous magnificence - extending her (there have been inconclusive debates if it should be his instead) helping hands to the suffering mass - twenty-one dancers had to queue up in a bee line, with only the foremost visible to the audience while all others coordinated their hand gestures in the back. Collective precision, not only synchronized but in sequence as well, was the key here, and don't forget that all the 21 artists are deaf, unable to hear musical cues and reliant on the sign conductors in the wings. It was an ornate, golden, and mesmerizing performance, by far the biggest visual reward in the show. Thursday's revival, on the occasion of the troupe's 30th anniversary and two score years of China's reform and opening up policy, was also a charity performance organized by the China Disabled Persons' Federation. The Beijing Exhibition Theater, with over 2700 seats, was packed with invited attendees, including disabled people and handicapped workers in Beijing, representatives from various UN agencies and other international interest groups in China, foreign diplomats and college and high school students. The aisles were packed with a traffic jam of wheelchairs. The show's perennial popularity – it's been staged more than two thousand times in over a hundred countries - is a testament to its transcending artistic appeal, as it speaks in the universal and timeless language of beauty and resilience, of dignity and hope.,But if   was the show's undisputed visual climax, it's perhaps In   that proved the afternoon's most stirring moment. The solo dance by Zhang Tianjiao, about an aspirant ballet dancer's perseverance and triumph, is one of the recent additions to the troupe's repertoire. Zhang took the stage in a black tutu, where she strutted and pranced, with such tender vibrancy that her slender shape, glorified in an expressive self-designed choreography, presented the revival's most potent symbol of human beauty and vitality. Such was her unabashed confidence that in the few seconds of a three-spin pirouette she seemed to completely cast off life's imperfections. A fleeting illusion indeed, but an unforgettable triumph shared with her audience. By the end of the two-hour show, the thunderous applause was perhaps the best reward to the troupe's artists, even though not all of them could hear the cries of ""Bravo!"", nor see the audience's beaming smiles. But as the afternoon's opening song said:"
1,"Government officials, business executives and experts hailed the role of the internet in empowering the digital economy, saying it is pivotal to driving economic and social development. In a forum during the ongoing Fifth World Internet Conference, participants touted the internet as a key driving force for improving people's lives and regarded the conference as a sharing and cooperation platform that helps promote technological innovation and industrial upgrading. Held in Wuzhen of Zhejiang province, the event will last until Friday. ""As today's most innovative and dynamic sector, the internet is profoundly changing people's production and daily lives,"" Zhuang Rongwen, minister of the Cyberspace Administration of China, said on Wednesday. ""Turning the world into a connected global village, the internet is injecting fresh vigor into innovative development."" According to Zhuang, more efforts are needed to advance fundamental research, make breakthroughs in core technologies, foster the sustainable development of cutting-edge internet technologies, build up the industrial ecosystem, strengthen international cooperation, and build a digital world of mutual trust and governance. Powered by blossoming artificial intelligence, big data, cloud computing and other technologies, China is gradually transforming into a leading global internet powerhouse. Statistics from the China Internet Network Information Center show the rapid growth of the booming internet trend: China's netizen population hit a new high, reaching 802 million by the end of June this year. In 2017, the country's digital economy amounted to 27.2 trillion yuan ($3.9 trillion), ranking No 2 globally and accounting for 32.9 percent of national GDP, according to a recent report released by the Cyberspace Administration of China. The achievement was lauded by Neil Shen, global managing partner of Sequoia Capital, who said: ""There was a time when Chinese startups were imitators and not innovators. Now the times have changed. Buoyed by the booming mobile internet in the last ten years, Chinese internet firms are now at the forefront in terms of innovation and leading business models, extending into more businesses than their foreign counterparts."",In particular, Shen said Chinese companies have a distinct competitive advantage in terms of talent. ""Embracing the industrial internet, the abundant engineering talent has laid a solid foundation for future innovation and entrepreneurship,"" Shen said. ""Compared with their parent generation, the younger generation has adopted a boarder mindset. Born in the internet era, tech-savvy young people usually have a deeper understanding of the mobile internet."" Chinese technology titan Xiaomi is one among the growing number of companies that have been reaping the benefits. Founded in 2010, the Beijing-based smartphone vendor reported more than 100 billion yuan in revenues last year. ""The key competitiveness of Xiaomi is striving for an open mind and employing internet technologies to improve the production and services,"" said Lei Jun, chairman and CEO of Xiaomi. Entering more than 80 countries globally, 36 percent of Xiaomi's revenues come from the overseas market, Lei said. With the industrial internet on the horizon, Xiaomi is actively gearing up in the expansion of IoT sector. Currently, Xiaomi has established the world's largest consumer internet of things platform, with more than 115 million smart devices powered by AI. ""It will be much more convenient to use smart hardware products as assistants to connect all the internet of things devices,"" Lei said. ""In the near future, each electronic device may be equipped with the smart voice system. Powered by AI technologies, I believe the whole internet of things will definitely take a big step forward."" John Chisholm, a member of the Development Committee of the MIT Corporation, said that devices will not only become smarter, but also adopt users' style and personalities. However, as more people enjoy the convenience brought by the internet, security risks remain. Last year, the WannaCry ransomware virus reportedly affected hundreds of thousands of computers in more than 150 countries and regions, including China. The virus wreaked havoc in around 30,000 institutions, such as universities, hospitals and research centers, as well as gas stations. Zhou Hongyi, chairman of the board and CEO of 360 Security Technology Inc, said we are entering the age of ""big security"".,""After years of development, society and the internet have become extremely close. Today, the internet actually breaks the boundaries between the physical world and the virtual network,"" said Zhou, whose security company is known for its antivirus software. ""So, cybersecurity is not only related to the internet but involves national security, social security, infrastructure security and even personal safety. That is why we are now entering the new big security age,"" he said. Zhou said that cyberattacks and cybercrimes will increase in the future. This will put at risk not only personal details but reams of company data. To combat the threat, a growing army of professionals will have to be recruited. ""Relying on traditional defensive thinking and means can no longer effectively solve security problems. We need to reach a consensus on building a community of shared interests in cyberspace."" Zhou said."
0,"Transport industry insiders and experts from China and abroad envisioned solutions to increasingly serious traffic congestion in big cities at a conference in Beijing last week. ""The city will need a central nervous system to give order to, dispatch and schedule entire transportation systems accordingly, to ensure the best experience, most efficient and safest transport mode,"" Liu Zhenfei, president of Alibaba mapping unit AutoNavi Software — also known at Gaode Map — said at the 2018 Summit on the Future of Transportation. Traffic congestion has become a serious issue in China due to the rapid rise in car ownership. Gaode released a list of the 10 Chinese cities with the worst congestion at the summit on Thursday, with Beijing, Guangzhou in Guangdong province and Jinan in Shandong province occupying the top three spots. Liu used five scenarios to show how the future city brain could dispatch transportation. ""Commuters traveling more than 100 kilometers can take flying vehicles, and the city brain is playing the role of intelligent air traffic control,"" he said. ""Thanks to the brain's schedule, the frequency of dispatching flying vehicles will be much higher than airplanes nowadays. And importantly, no delays."" People commuting 50 to 100 km will take super-high-speed trains. The city's brain will arrange a precise number of trains to meet demand and schedule departure times. There will be no ticket shortage at peak hours and no empty trains wasting money at off-peak times. Commuters traveling between 20 and 50 km will take intelligent buses dispatched by the city brain, while those traveling 5 to 20 km will take autonomous vehicles. The brain will calculate the best route and timing to avoid traffic congestion and maximize the number of passengers carried. Commuters traveling less than 5 km will ride shared bikes, with the brain using data to ensure a sufficient number are deployed to meet riders' needs, Liu said. Knut Sauer, co-founder of Arrivo, a startup in the United States focused on high-speed urban transport networks, said a solution to traffic congestion is to add a seamless, high-speed super urban network layer to existing infrastructure. ""The speed depends on how much money you invest,"" he said. Until June 2016, Sauer was vice-president of business development at Hyperloop One, a main player in the development of next-generation transportation. He said the new system will increase the throughput of vehicles and improve efficiency to curb traffic congestion. Sauer showed an artist's impression of autonomous vehicles traveling in a tube, with regular cars on parallel freeways. Sauer envisioned transportation in Beijing in 2040 using the technology. ""In 20 minutes, you can be anywhere in Beijing,"" he said."

Yan Ligang, head of Beijing's Commerce Bureau, said consumers are requiring a higher level of services, and upgrading the sector is essential to the capital's high-quality development. Under the plan, authorities will encourage the dining industry to be greener and more regulated. ""People's desire for late-night dining has increased in recent years,"" the plan said. ""Breakfast services will also be improved by the end of 2021, with a target of establishing more than 300 fixed stores."" Li Xinlei, a 25-year-old white-collar worker in Chaoyang district, said she frequently goes to a late-night dining block with dozens of restaurants called the 21 Block at the Hopson One shopping mall near the East Fourth Ring Road. ""Night life starts at 9 pm with delicious food and drinks,"" she said. ""I'm happy that we have such a place to relax and enjoy the food at night. My friends and I often go there after work."" In addition, the government will upgrade barrier-free facilities in all shopping centers to ensure that 90 percent of the city's shopping areas provide full service for disabled people by 2021. Pan Yuming, an expert with Beijing's industry and commerce federation, said the government will impose detailed standards on industries such as dining, hairdressing and domestic services and cultivate professionals in those industries. ""During the drafting of those standards, we have learned from other countries such as Japan, which is well-known for its good service, and will try to raise the efficiency of the city's services,"" he said. The bureau signed agreements on Wednesday with Meituan and Alibaba Group's Koubei, two online consumer service providers, to use their big databases to evaluate the degree of satisfaction from the public."

Launched in December 2017, the contest selected 121 students from 27 divisions of the university in the intermediary contest, and among them, 38 stood out after expert review. The contestants were divided into two groups -- English majors and non-English majors, who were from more than 30 majors covering social work and preschool education. The backgrounds of the contestants also varied. They included an ex-soldier from the post-1990 generation, the disabled, ethnic students from remote villages, and the elderly, all of whom told their stories in English and expressed their pursuit of lifelong study during the contest. Huang Zhenhua, a professor from the University of International Business and Economics and a judge at the contest, said that true stories narrated by the contestants reflect that our country has entered a stage of lifelong study, which is also the school management theory of the Open University of China. The final of the contest was attended by Wang Li, a head from the Department of Vocational and Adult Education of the Ministry of Education; Liu Chengbin, from the Beijing Municipal Education Commission; and Li Linshu, Liu Chen and Liu Xianghong, heads from the Open University of China. The Open University of China is dedicated to the lifelong study of the nation. Currently there are 3.6 million registered students, including workers, farmers, soldiers, doctors, teachers and retired seniors. Except for academic education, the university also sets up online classes, online lectures and open courses for students, and provides public services such as distance learning, training and information consultation for enterprises, institutions and communities."
1,"The road for Chinese companies to invest in the United States could still be bumpy this year even though the two countries sought to ease their economic disputes and agreed not to engage in a trade war, experts said. Chinese companies could face much lengthier and more complex procedures to have their merger and acquisition deals reviewed and approved by the US government and the increasing uncertainty could prompt them to look away from the US as an investment destination in the short term, according to lawyers who offer legal advice and services to Chinese companies. ""There's been great concern expressed by Chinese companies about whether or not it's worth the effort (investing in the US) … If it's not going to be seen favorably from the beginning then they'll look elsewhere to figure out another place to invest,"" said Wendy Wysong, a partner of London-based law firm Clifford Chance, who practices in Hong Kong. Factors such as growing US regulatory scrutiny, uncertainties in China-US trade discussions and the controversy involving Chinese telecommunication equipment maker ZTE Corp have cast a shadow on the outlook of the Chinese investment in the US. In the first quarter, the value of outbound deals reached by Chinese companies contracted by 15 percent year-on-year to $94 billion, according to law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer. The decline in Chinese outbound investment can be largely attributed to less investment in the US, as the US government is tightening its grip on mergers and acquisitions by Chinese companies, especially in the technology sector, said Alan Wang, corporate partner in Freshfields' global transactions group. Stanley Jia, chief representative of law firm Baker McKenzie's Beijing office, said that M&As and corporate activity by Chinese companies in general will likely remain at a wait-and-see stage given the uncertainties in the China-US trade discussions and any material impact it could have on Chinese investment in the US. ""If we see broadening and retaliatory measures spreading, that would no doubt add uncertainty to the outlook in the short term, and businesses do not like uncertainty,"" Jia said. ""Therefore, political risk assessment and regulatory planning are increasingly becoming an important part of an overall deal strategy."" Chinese investment in the US already saw a sharp decline last year. Chinese firms completed $29 billion worth of investments in the US last year, down 35 percent from the record $46 billion completed in 2016, according to a joint report by the National Committee on US-China Relations and Rhodium Group. While tighter domestic regulation on risky overseas investment was one reason behind the decline, short-term unfavorable conditions in the US have clearly hit the deal-making appetite of Chinese companies. Prominent transactions abandoned by Chinese investors due to irresolvable concerns by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States included Ant Financial's acquisition of Moneygram, Zhongwang's takeover of aluminium producer Aleris and Canyon Bridge Capital Partners' acquisition of Lattice Semiconductor. Wysong at Clifford Chance said that Chinese companies that are looking to invest in the US need to consider what their obligations are. Clifford Chance has been representing ZTE Corp from 2012 till now. ""Putting aside the ZTE case, I think that any company that is dependent on US origin goods needs to consider the implications of the US export control laws and US economic sanctions, and the enforcement tools that the United States will bring to bear if they become concerned about a particular company's conduct,"" Wysong said. ""They must be aware that there are certain interests that the United States has. For example, with the recent withdrawal from the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action), there are going to be secondary sanctions on particular industry sectors in Iran and non-US companies need to be aware of those,"" she pointed out. Timothy Wilkins, a partner in Freshfeilds' global transactions group, said that CFIUS, the US inter-agency panel that reviews foreign acquisitions, has entered a more aggressive era of enforcement. ""One proof is the average time spent on the investigation process of overseas investment. While in 2015, less than 30 percent of the overseas investment into the US will go through a 40-day investigation, the rate now is over 70 percent. The time for a Chinese company to complete the investigation might last for up to five months,"" he said. Nonetheless, the long-term outlook of Chinese outbound investment remains optimistic as it will be driven by factors such as the Belt and Road Initiative and the global economy needs Chinese capital to be deployed, according to law firm Baker McKenzie. ""We believe outbound M&A will restart its growth trend in 2018 with a modest increase compared to 2017,"" said Jia at Baker McKenzie. ""China will be increasingly driven by service sectors and consumer spending. It is likely that healthcare, pharmaceuticals and consumer-related industries will become increasingly important M&A sectors,"" he said."
1,"The United States' unilateral actions under the Section 301 Investigation have violated the World Trade Organization's fundamental principles of multilateralism, an expert said on Saturday. Xiao Jin, partner at King & Wood Mallesons, a Beijing-headquartered multinational law firm, said that the measures taken by the US will lead to a situation where normal trade disputes are solved by unilateral actions rather than multilateral procedures. ""The US unilateral actions will disrupt the multilateral trading system and increase the uncertainty in the global trading environment. It should be condemned by the international community,"" he added. According to Xiao, the US unilateral actions under its domestic Section 301 Investigation violate WTO's rules and principles in three aspects. First, it is a violation of the most-favored-nation treatment principle, as the US announced additional tariffs targeting only China but not any other countries. Second, the announced 25 percent tariffs on Chinese imports exceed the maximum rates the US committed to under the WTO. Third, under the exclusive jurisdiction of the WTO dispute settlement system, any attempt to seek redress must be made in the institutional framework of the WTO only. The WTO rules do not permit the US to unilaterally claim China violates its WTO obligations and impose additional tariffs. Xiao said that the US has been vetoing the appointment of new members to the WTO's Appellate Body since last year, which will destroy the dispute settlement mechanism in the near future and will damage the multilateral dispute settlement mechanism. The statistics offered by Xiao show that there have been 137 cases against the US at the WTO, accounting for about a quarter of the total cases handled by the WTO. Of the 80 cases for which the WTO has issued rulings, the US lost 69 of them, being held to have violated the WTO rules. This number is far more than that of China. ""The Chinese government has always firmly defended the multilateral system,"" Xiao added. ""China will always seek redress via WTO procedures for solving trade disputes. This time, China was forced to take some defensive actions to fight against the US's additional tariffs. At the same time, China also has requested consultations with the US under the WTO over those additional tariffs imposed as a result of the Section 301 Investigation. This again shows China's position in supporting the WTO and safeguarding the multilateral system."""
1,"Chaoyang district in eastern Beijing, where almost all the embassies are located, is taking measures to strengthen communications with embassies and international organizations to promote the further opening-up of its service sector, according to officials. Chaoyang district hosted a promotional event at Beijing’s iconic Olympic Tower to introduce its continuously optimized business environment, industrial development potential and upgrade plans to representatives from 15 embassies, including the British Embassy Beijing and the Embassy of Japan in China, five international organizations and some companies on Wednesday. Wang Hao, Party chief of Chaoyang district, shared the district’s internationalization plan with all participants. “We are working on a three-year action plan and will put in place some supportive policies to promote internationalization in regions such as Sanlitun, Wangjing, Maizidian and the area around the embassies,” Wang said. Wang Xining, a member of the standing committee of the CPC Beijing, said Chaoyang district will adopt a new industrial development mode, ease market access, and carry out pilot projects in fields such as finance, science and technology, business and cultural creation to support its service sector development in upcoming years. Chen Qinghua, director of Chaoyang district’s commission of commerce, said the initiative will help attract more foreign companies to Chaoyang district and establish a service platform for businesses in the district to seek opportunities in foreign markets. The events also will promote mutual understanding between Chaoyang district and other parts of the world. “I am glad to hear Chaoyang district is fostering one of the best service sectors and planning to do more in the future. The UK has world-class expertise in a number of areas including law, accounting, financial services, advertising, architecture and insurance,” said Nicola Lu, head of Capital Investment at the British Embassy in Beijing. Lu said that the UK is looking forward to having more communication and collaboration with China’s industry. Dong Bin, chairman of the Sino-European Entrepreneurs Summit Committee, said that Chaoyang district will play a more significant role in supporting regional development. “As I have been working and living in Chaoyang for more than 20 years, my own observation about this area is that it is more open, inclusive, safe, international, energetic and is an inspiration,” Dong said. Robert Sterling Quant, ambassador from the Bahamas to China, also shared areas where China and Bahamas can collaborate in upcoming years. Chaoyang district has been committed to developing a long-term effective communications mechanism to strengthen ties with embassies and international organizations. The event on Wednesday marked the debut of the mechanism. Officials also said that more similar events will be organized this year. For instance, Chaoyang district will organize two communications events this year, which will target G20 member countries and countries taking part in the Belt and Road Initiative. It also will host matchmaking events to better connect Chinese companies with businesses from countries such as the UK, US and Australia. The district also will leverage its iconic landmarks – such as the Prince Shun Cheng Mansion and the Bird’ Nest stadium – to promote international exchanges, according to officials. Consultancy service provider PwC said in a report released on Nov 6 that Chaoyang district is home to nearly 10,000 foreign companies and to date had attracted more than $60 billion in foreign investment to the region. The report said that Chaoyang district has 122 regional headquarters established by multinational companies, accounting for 70 percent of Beijing’s total. The region also is home to 71 Global Fortune 500-listed companies. There were 327 foreign financial firms in the region in 2018."
1,"Subway trains designed to run on Beijing's new airport subway line, which links the Beijing Daxing International Airport and Caoqiao subway station in downtown Beijing, made its debut on Tuesday. The trains are capable of fully automated driverless operation, and with a designed speed of 160 kilometers per hour, they are the fastest subway trains in China. The 40-km journey from Caoqiao station to the capital's new airport will only take 19 minutes. Currently, the travel speed of most subway trains is 80 km/h.,The trains each have a business class carriage, a first in the country. The eight-carriage train, which is about 22.8 meters long and 3.3 meters wide, will be able to carry a maximum of 1,500 passengers. There are wheelchair spaces and USB charging ports by the passenger seats on the train. The new subway trains are expected to start trial operation in September, when the Beijing Daxing International Airport is due to open."
0,"A host of shared self-service mini-gymnasiums, each covering about 5 square meters, have sprung up in China's major cities, including Beijing. Each features a mini exercise booth－which resembles a phone kiosk－a treadmill, air conditioner and purifier, and a high-definition screen to play games, listen to music or watch TV dramas. With the basic fitness equipment needed to work out in a regular gymnasium, these mini premises can be booked and sessions paid for through smartphone apps. In June last year, Beijing fitness startup Misspao rolled out shared mini-gyms in communities in nine cities nationwide. They were: Shenzhen, Guangdong province; Nanjing, Jiangsu province; Hangzhou, Zhejiang province; Qingdao, Shandong province, Xi'an, Shaanxi province; Chengdu, Sichuan province; and Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin. After paying a deposit, users can book the nearest gym and scan the access code with their smartphones. For about 6 yuan ($0.9) for half an hour, they can also rent mini-gyms in nearby neighborhoods for exercise and bodybuilding. Bi Zhen, CEO of Misspao, cited a recent survey conducted by the company that found that about 95 percent of respondents said they needed exercise, but only 10 percent had gym membership. ""Under a heavy workload, many people lack the time to work out frequently. And that's exactly what we can offer. Even busy white-collar workers can enjoy the convenience brought by these mini fitness booths in nearby residential communities,"" Bi said. The company said each one costs from 15,000 to 20,000 yuan. Based on the average total usage time of six hours a day, they can yield high rates of return and break even in eight to 10 months. Bi aims to build a smart sports community that allows people to choose mini-gyms that are about five minutes' walk away, instead of heading to distant fitness centers. The mini-gyms are equipped with aerobic machines, such as exercise bikes. Misspao will also roll out a wide range of training classes to target users' specific needs for fitness and bodybuilding. Zhu Xiaoxiao, CEO of the app FitTime, said, ""It's really a huge market. Driven by the desire for smaller waistlines and healthier lifestyles, more people, especially the health-conscious younger generation, are willing to spend time and money on fitness and slimming services."" Statistics from the China Internet Network Information Center show that of the 802 million netizens in China, 98.3 percent are mobile phone users, which provides a huge base for the blossoming online sports and fitness industry. Government policy is also fueling the smart sports sector. According to a national fitness plan, spending on sports and fitness is expected to reach 1.5 trillion yuan in 2020."
0,"The rapid expansion of China's road, rail and air networks has solved most of the traditional problems associated with travel during Spring Festival, such as the fierce competition for tickets and traffic gridlock. Now, the country's transportation authorities are focusing on passenger comfort and convenience. An estimated 2.98 billion journeys are expected to be made during this year's 40 day Spring Festival travel rush, which runs from Feb 1 to March 12, according to the National Development and Reform Commission. The prefestival peak has already approached. According to China Railway Corp, since Feb 1, the national railways handled 89 million trips by Saturday. Leading the way are airports and train stations in major cities, where advanced technology and upgraded facilities have helped remove some of the stress from traveling home or abroad for Lunar New Year, which this year falls on Feb 16. Shen Peilan has had a habit of missing trains and flights in the past, so she would regularly leave her home in Wangjing, northeast Beijing, three hours before her departure time to make sure she made it to her seat in time. On Tuesday, however, when she plans to catch a flight home to Shanghai for the holidays, she will leave just 90 minutes before. ""It'll be a bit of a rush, but the fast lane at Beijing Capital International Airport and the'QR code boarding pass' will save me lots of time,"" the 32-year-old interpreter said. Beijing Capital International Airport, the country's busiest, has opened an express lane for passengers traveling to Shanghai, while those who check-in online will be able to simply present a QR code to pass security checks and the boarding gate. ""I've done online check-in before using the QR code and I haven't missed any flights,"" Shen said. ""It's very fast, and there's no waiting in lines. It cuts out some of the boredom."" Air China, the nation's flagship carrier, opened eight self check-in baggage desks at Beijing Capital International Airport last month to improve efficiency. They allow passengers on selected services to check their own luggage by putting it on a conveyor belt with no need to line up. The airline also granted travelers on certain air routes at 22 airports worldwide the right to use QR codes on board instead of printed boarding passes. Around 65 million of those journeys will be completed by air, a 10 percent year-on-year growth. Good news for those who like to choose their entertainment or chat with faraway friends mid-flight is that the Civil Aviation Authority of China announced in January that passengers are now allowed to use mobile devices on airplanes. Several carriers, including Hainan Airlines and China-Southern Airlines, have said they will be lifting the ban on smartphones. On the ground, airports are also adding features to make journeys more enjoyable, particularly for parents. Beijing Capital International Airport has set up mother-and-infant rooms equipped with sinks, singlehand operation tables and breastfeeding chairs. Each terminal also has themed play areas to help parents keep their children entertained. Train stations will as usual see a lot more traffic than airports this Spring Festival. The NDRC estimates more than 390 million journeys will be made by rail, up by 8.8 percent compared with the same period last year. China Railway Corp, the national rail operator, launched several measures to improve services and benefit travelers. For example, the official 12306.cn ticket booking system increased the daily sales capability to 15 million tickets from 10 million tickets this year. Catering services have also been upgraded. As well as purchasing food on the train, passengers have been able to order food from station restaurants to be delivered to their seat as soon as the train pulls into the station since mid 2017. However, now the minimum order time has been halved to just one hour before delivery, while the meal options have been increased. Waiting passengers also enjoy better services at train stations. Zhang Chengbin, a construction worker in Guangzhou, has returned to Chongqing every year in the past 10 spring festivals. Each year, he boarded a train at the Guangzhou South Station during the travel rush and has witnessed the change of the station. ""The station's environment becomes better and the service improves, such as the new nursing room and playground,"" he said, while watching his two grandchildren playing at the station's amusement playground, which had a slide and rocking horses. ""Without the nursing room and playground, it was difficult to manage two children,"" he said."
1,"China Daily and SASAC News Center recently interviewed an honored guest from the Embassy of Mexico, Felipe Garcia, commercial counselor of the ProMéxico Beijing Office. He spoke highly of China's achievements in the 40 years of reform and opening-up, especially in poverty alleviation, urbanization and modernization and said Mexico needs to learn from China's practices and experience. The counselor regards the Belt and Road Initiative as the ""one of the most important initiatives in China"" and said ""it can be global, regional and national impact on international cooperation."" Mexico has been ""watching with the great interest this initiative."" Garcia said Mexico is becoming a hub for international trade with its broad net of free trade agreements and presents a good opportunity that Chinese companies should grasp to expand their markets in the Americas. Mexico's industries such as agriculture, auto parts, automobiles, advanced manufacturing, renewable energy, infrastructure, and mining welcome Chinese investment."
0,"On February 11th, just several days before the commercialized Saint Valentine's Day, I celebrated my first birthday in Beijing. I have always had in mind a plan that when I will turn 30 (that was last year), I will take a train from Moscow to Beijing, through the trans-Mongolian railway, which will stop me in the heart of Asia, Beijing. An adventurous and long trip, but I like treating myself with these kinds of challenges.   But this year, I found myself in Beijing celebrating the starting of the Dragon's Year; eating dumplings, going to temple fair festivals, enjoying the fireworks, watching the red-and-golden lanterns, enjoying Chinese food and going out with my new friends. It is true, I did not have to take the long distance train ride from Moscow to Beijing through the trans-Mongolian railway, but I made it to the Chinese capital. I work in a very versatile environment: China Radio International (CRI), which like companies I used to work before, such as BBC World Service Radio, I like to call it as a mini-United Nations. There are people from around the World, working in different language departments; bringing with them in one place bits of their languages and cultures from their own countries. As in contrast to the BBC World Service Radio, where English is the language you communicate and work with, at the CRI you find a different experience. People working in different language services, are not only natives from the countries of the World, in which the language is spoken, but there are also Chinese, who have learned respective languages, which they now use in their daily working schedule.  It takes you sometime to get used with the fact that you are in the heart of Asia, and yet you have people speaking your language. I have to be frank, my mother tongue, is not a simple language. Foreigners, who want to learn it, find it very difficult, since it has no connection with any branches of the languages’ tree. But my Chinese colleagues dedicated themselves and decided to study Albanian, and after four years studies at the University and visits to Albania, they now are fluent and professional translators from Chinese to Albanian and vice-versa.  I came to Beijing by the end of December and started working on the first day of January. It is usual for a person moving out of his/her hometown and settling down in a new one to have the curiosity of what is going to expect him/her. Even though, I have been living in the past in different European cities and the United States, before coming to China, I have to admit, I did not know what was expecting me. Of course, you search on the Internet, just to get an idea, but as people are different and they share different experiences and have different expectations, it is hard to kind of create a clear picture about the city you are about to have it as your new home. So, I decided to implement the well-know expression and advice old people back home give to the youngsters we use back home. I love big cities, so Beijing fulfills that condition. Even though I live in the Western part of Beijing, far from downtown, I find the public transport well organized and easy to get to different places. Especially the subway system, which I find it very convenient and helpful with the English-speaking lady telling you, in which stop you are arriving, or with the signs at the exits, also written in English.  I find Chinese people friendly. When I have asked for directions for a certain place, or asking for service I want to get, bearing in mind that my Chinese language skills are too limited, I was helped out. It is highly appreciated.  Beijing, as every metropolis in the World, has a lot to offer: Starting from cultural activities; exhibitions, concerts, movies, sightseeing, variety of food and even lessons on how to cook delicious Chinese traditional dishes. I love Chinese food, and I am well known among my friends back home for going too often to the local Chinese restaurant. And in addition to that: Where else can you get the best Chinese food, if not in China? ?  So, my 31st birthday found me in Beijing. As a birthday boy, I was surprised by my colleagues with a tasty fruity cake and a paper-made crown, making me the ""king"" of that day. Being far away from home, family and friends, the wishes in my mother tongue ""G?zuar dit?lindjen"" (Happy Birthday) here in Beijing reminded me another expression: ""Your home is where your heart is""."

The main venue of this year's weeklong event, from Oct 9 to 15, is Chengdu, Southwest China's Sichuan province, marking the first time for a western Chinese city to host the event. The Beijing venue will hold a series of events such as a high-quality development forum, innovation and entrepreneurship contests, a regional collaborative innovation development symposium, and launching and signing ceremonies for key projects. In addition to showcasing cutting-edge innovations in different cities around the country, the event also takes place overseas, with over 100 activities happening in different countries. The inaugural National Mass Innovation and Entrepreneurship Week kicked off in 2015, after Chinese Premier Li Keqiang proposed themass entrepreneurship and innovation campaign at Summer Davos in September 2014."
1,"China will lift foreign ownership restrictions in the life insurance sector in three years and raise foreign ownership limits to 51 percent in joint-venture life insurance firms by the end of June, a top regulatory official said. Speaking at a panel discussion during the Boao Forum for Asia on Wednesday, Yi Gang, the governor of the People's Bank of China, the central bank, said the new measures will form part of the broader package of policies that will further open up the country's financial sector. Industry insiders said the new measures will instill market vitality and create new development opportunities. By June 30 this year, most of the measures will be in place, Yi said, the first time that China has provided a clear timeline on its financial market opening-up plans since the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China last October. Wang Guojun, an insurance professor at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, said the new measures are well within expectations. ""The change in the foreign ownership ceiling in a joint venture life insurer from the previous 50 percent to 51 percent is very important and can help reduce internal rivalries,"" said Wang. Chen Liang, CEO of Allianz China Life, welcomed the latest round of opening-up measures. ""The central government's latest efforts will benefit the whole insurance industry. A more open and fully-competitive market will not only bring new development opportunities for Allianz and other foreign insurers, but also bring lots of benefits for Chinese customers,"" said Chen. Being the first European insurer entering the Chinese market, Allianz has been operating in the country for 19 years and has developed a full line of businesses including life insurance, property and casualty insurance and asset management. ""We believe we can play a bigger role in better serving Chinese customers, especially in the fields of pension business and health insurance sectors,"" Chen added. ""And we are looking forward to more supportive regulatory policies that encourage product innovation."" Statistics from the banking and insurance regulator showed that foreign life insurers' market share in China stood at around 5.8 percent by the end of last year. But their market share in the country's metropolitan cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou has been close to 20 percent. Besides, qualified foreign investors are also allowed to run insurance agencies and survey and loss adjustment businesses in China. Foreign brokers will also enjoy the same business scope like their Chinese counterparts. Shen Kaitao, chairman of Jiang Tai Insurance Brokers Co Ltd, one of the country's largest insurance brokers, said such measures will help to improve the efficiency of the whole industry with more competition in the market. ""With years of development, Chinese insurance brokers have gained rich experience in dealing with SMEs and individuals. So, the latest efforts in opening up are not likely to deal a blow to domestic players,"" said Shen."

According to Beijing Railway Bureau, each train has set aside a carriage for goods, mainly documents, garments, food, electronic devices, and others. This is the first time that high-speed trains are being used to cope with the delivery rush after the online shopping extravaganza. The delivery capacity is about 50,000 ton and delivery time will be cut down to six hours, which is faster than road transportation which usually takes 20 to 24 hours."

1,"SAN FRANCISCO - Despite trade disputes, the United States and China have more areas of common concern, engagement and partnership than areas of disagreement, said Gary Locke, former US ambassador to China. The disagreements on trade are significant, but the two countries are working on ""many other areas of cooperation and trust,"" Locke told Xinhua on the sidelines of the annual conference of a prominent Chinese American group, the Committee of 100 (C100), over the weekend. ""The United States and China are actually working very closely together on many, many other issues, on scientific research, on medical research, fighting global terrorism, and stopping piracy off the coast of Africa,"" he said. Their cooperation also covers the Iran nuclear issue and the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue, said Locke, who was also former governor of US state of Washington and former US Secretary of Commerce. ""Even though the United States and China have always had disagreements, we've always been able to move forward and continue the partnership and engagement in other issues, people-to-people exchange, scientific exchange, working on climate change, fighting global terrorism, even having cooperation on our militaries,"" he said. ""So we just need to focus on the areas of common interest, common goals, and try to minimize the areas of disagreement and where we do have disagreement, we need to continue to find ways to solve and reach a resolution,"" he said. Speaking of bilateral economic relationship, Locke told an audience of more than 500 leaders and experts in government, business, technology, academia, and media attending the two-day C100 conference that the two countries are increasingly economically interdependent since China's opening-up. ""Today, roughly $1.5 billion of goods and services flow between our two countries every single day,"" he said in a keynote speech on Saturday. ""China is our largest export market outside of North America, with exports to China growing at twice the rate as exports to the rest of the world, and America is China's largest export market exceeding exports to all of the EU countries combined."" ""More than 900,000 American jobs depend on producing goods and services exported to China and more than 2.6 million jobs in the US and many, many millions more in China depend on two-way trade between our two countries, so people in both countries are benefiting from this deepening economic integration,"" he added. As for the trade disputes between the two countries, Locke told Xinhua that he was glad that the two countries will have further consultations after the trade talks in Beijing. ""I don't think it was realistic to expect that in their first time meeting that they could reach an agreement. The issues are too difficult, too complex and many more meetings will be required,"" the former ambassador said. Locke said even though the United States has serious concerns about some of the trade and economic policies of China, ""I don't agree with using tariffs as a way to seek changes in other countries. We don't need to start a trade war."" ""A trade war is bad for both countries. There are no winners. Everybody loses especially the workers, consumers and companies,"" he added."
0,"Plans include support for schools, transportation and innovation  Beijing rolled out a series of plans on Monday to support the development of Xiongan New Area, aiming to help the new economic zone become the major center for the city's noncapital functions.  The planned new area in Hebei province, announced in April, is about 100 kilometers southwest of Beijing and is dubbed one of the two wings of the capital.  Beijing will support Xiongan in eight areas - working mechanisms, scientific and technological innovation, transportation, environment, industries, public services, planning and design and talent exchange - according to a strategic cooperation agreement signed by the two sides last week.  The Beijing Municipal Commission of Development and Reform detailed the agreement at a news conference on Monday.  ""We will use our advantages in different areas, such as innovation, education and medical care, to cooperate with Xiongan for meeting its most urgent needs,"" a commission official was quoted as saying by Beijing Daily.  Under the agreement, Beijing, as a center of innovation, will promote its innovative resources - such as the Zhongguancun Science Park - to transfer resources or establish branches in Xiongan.  A counterpart of the park will be set up in the new area as a base for high-end innovation and startups.  To support innovative projects, a special fund under a current Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei cooperative development fund is being studied.  For easier transportation, construction of high-speed railways between Beijing and Xiongan will be accelerated under the agreement. Also, the Beijing-Xiongan rail line, currently under construction as an upgrade from an old line, will be put into operation in 2019. A one-way trip will take only 30 minutes, shaving about an hour off the current time.  A new expressway directly linking the two will also be built.  To improve Xiongan's public services, an area in which Xiongan is weaker, Beijing will invest in a high-class kindergarten, a primary and a secondary school and a comprehensive hospital, according to the agreement.  They will be managed by first-rate educational and medical institutions chosen from Beijing. The institutions will provide training and talent to support and upgrade the existing local schools and hospitals in Xiongan, which cover Xiongxian, Rongcheng and Anxin counties.  In the areas of infrastructure, Beijing will encourage State-owned companies such as Beijing Energy Investment Holding Co and Beijing Waterworks Group to provide services. The two will also cooperate in protecting the region's environment and developing high-tech industries and up-to-date financial services.  ""These projects are just a beginning,"" the commission said, adding that along with the development of Xiongan, Beijing will carry out collaborative plans on a regular basis."
0,"Never in his wildest dreams did Li Wenyan imagine he would enjoy such a magical time to celebrate International Children's Day. Guided by visiting NBA legend Horace Grant, the 11-year-old hoops fan shot baskets through proper rings and nets for the first time in his life. Lack of facilities had previously limited Li to practicing against a wall on a shabby playground at Beijing Mingyuan School, which caters to children of migrant workers. He was among 60 students invited to the NBA Cares charity event on Monday in the capital, where they learned dribbling and shooting alongside Grant as well as playing interactive games with the former league All Star. ""It's a little bit surreal for me,"" said Li, a fourth-grader. ""With an actual NBA star this big teaching us side-by-side, I was so overexcited that I missed a lot of shots. The whole experience feels like a dream come true."" Under its community outreach program, NBA China has staged over 140 similar events in the league's biggest overseas market. Grant, a four-time NBA champion with the Chicago Bulls (1991-93) and Los Angeles Lakers (2001), said it's inspiring to ""put smiles back on kids' faces"". ""It helps them just escape from what they have back home, to have fun and just get away from that for a few hours. I am pretty sure it's priceless,"" said Grant, who came from a poor family in Sparta, Georgia.,Monday's event was the latest chapter in the NBA's special relationship with China - over three decades since the league first aired game highlights here in 1987. Since then, it has committed to growing basketball here through talent cultivation, youth development and charity as part of its overall effort to make hoops the No 1 sport in the world's most populous nation. According to league figures, 642 million Chinese watched NBA programming over the course of the 2017-2018 season. That's almost double the population of the United States. At last year's NBA Finals between the Golden State Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers, China Central Television managed to attract 25 million viewers per game, while the ongoing finals series between the Warriors and the Toronto Raptors this year has already stirred a new wave of passion. The NBA is now the most-followed sports league on Chinese social media, with over 190 million followers on multiple platforms. Despite lacking a Chinese star to fill the void left by the retirement of Hall of Famer Yao Ming in 2011, the league's presence in China has become even stronger - no matter how relations between the two countries change politically or economically. NBA commissioner Adam Silver said his league will always be on the same page as the Chinese Basketball Association in developing the game together. ""This is something Yao and I have discussed, where we can use basketball maybe in the way ping pong was used back in the day, that there could be something called basketball diplomacy. It is an area where our two countries have an excellent history of cooperation,"" Silver said recently, referring to the exchange of table tennis players between China and the United States in the early 1970s that led to a thaw in Sino-US relations. The exchange of talent on the basketball court has become an ever-present element of the NBA's strategy in China.,Since 2004, the league has sent over half of its franchises to play 26 preseason games here, with this year's China Games set to feature the 16-time champion Lakers against the Brooklyn Nets, on Oct 10 in Shanghai and in Shenzhen two days later. Nine Chinese players have played in or been drafted by the NBA since 1987 - the most successful being current CBA president Yao, who was an eight-time All Star with the Houston Rockets. ""I see it as an opportunity to demonstrate to people that through sports there's commonality and we can use the values of sports hopefully as a positive force to continue to bring people together,"" added Silver on the countries' basketball links. With an estimated 300 million people playing the game in China, basketball has transcended sport to become a tool of communication and inspiration, argues Hong Jianping, a researcher with Beijing Sport University. ""Sport is the common ground where two countries can put aside disputes politically and culturally to play under the same rules,"" said Hong. ""Basketball is enjoying mainstream popularity in both countries and is an ideal platform to bring people together and to reach mutual understandings beyond."" As part of the NBA's partnership with the Ministry of Education launched in 2014, a basketball curriculum, jointly developed by the two sides, was expanded to 4,000 schools and 4 million students in the 2018-19 school year. The curriculum will be expanded to 6 million students across 6,000 schools in the next school year, starting this September. The NBA is also extending a helping hand to China's men's national team, which has accepted an invitation to play in the NBA Summer League from July 5-15 in Las Vegas. The trip is designed to help Team China prepare for this fall's FIBA World Cup on home courts, and mirrors a similar move when the nation's elite hoopsters warmed up for the 2008 Beijing Olympics by playing in the 2007 Summer League. ""Sport is universal and a great way to bridge cultures,"" said NBA China CEO Derek Chang. ""We are supportive of what the CBA and the Ministry of Education are trying to accomplish in growing the game and promoting a healthy lifestyle in China."""

1,"BEIJING - Sun Lingjun, 35, is looking forward to the upcoming Summer Davos meeting in Northeast China's port city of Dalian, Liaoning province.  Representing Dalian locals at the forum, the entrepreneur will have access to nearly all conferences but the closed-door sessions, a rare opportunity for him to rub shoulders with global opinion-makers.  ""I am eager to hear new insights and incorporate them into our strategies and operations,"" he said.  Sun believes the meeting will give a push to his company, Dalian CheeringTech, which made more than 6 million yuan ($900,000) from sales and services of its primary product, the world's smallest smart camera controller, in Europe, the United States and other overseas markets last year.  Sun's enthusiasm for Summer Davos, officially the Annual Meeting of the New Champions, is echoed across the country. Over 2,000 figures from politics, business, civil society, academia and the arts will assemble in the city from June 27 to 29 to discuss topics from inclusive growth to the new industrial revolution.  Established by the World Economic Forum in 2007, the meeting is held each year in China, alternating between Dalian and Tianjin.  Summer Davos has been good for Dalian, reshaping the landscape of regional economy and strengthening the port's trade with other markets. The city has become a financial, shipping and logistics center for northeast China and beyond.  ""By hosting Summer Davos, Dalian has become an international city, a showpiece of reform and opening up and a center of economic growth,"" said Guo Xikun, an official coordinating the meeting.  Dalian registered 6.5 percent economic growth in 2016, the only city with any significant growth in the whole province. The city imported nearly 180 billion yuan of goods last year, and exported over 160 billion yuan, more than half of the province's total.  Summer Davos has brought the world to doors of many local firms.  ""We are based in Dalian but think of ourselves as a global business,"" Sun said. Around 95 percent CheeringTech business came from overseas last year and Sun is now helping other companies raise funds via websites like Indiegogo and Kickstarter.  A local manufacturer of numerical control machines, Dalian Guangyang Science & Technology Engineering has products that compete with global leaders.  ""We have mastered the core technology of an area once seen as a weak link in China's manufacturing sector and we are now expanding into the international arena,"" Guangyang's chairman Yu Dehai said.  ""Foreign firms see Summer Davos as a bellwether of China's economy and external policies,"" said Lawrence Lin, managing director of Orix Corporation's China branch.  The Tokyo-based financial multinational set up its China headquarter in Dalian in 2009 when the meeting was held there for the second time. In 2015, it increased its registered capital by $300 million, encouraged by growth prospects.  ""The decision to invest more in China has been very good for our company,"" Lin said. Orix's global revenue grew 13.1 percent in the last fiscal year and net profits rose by 5 percent.  Following Orix, other foreign investors began to set up businesses in Dalian. Temasek, a Singapore investment company, established a joint venture and spent 1 billion yuan building an IT park, which is now home to branches of IBM and Konica Minolta, among others. Woon Yun Ling, senior general manager of the park, said the company plans to spend another 200 million yuan on expansion.  During the Meeting of the New Champions two years ago, Dalian reached investment agreements worth $3.4 billion with foreign companies, including Goodyear, Maflow, Pfizer and SoftBank Group, in areas including finance, manufacturing and e-commerce. To date, 18,600 foreign-funded companies have invested more than $100 billion in Dalian.  Lin's company is considering patent cooperation with a local research institute and hopes to assist in the reorganization of state-owned enterprises.  ""The industrial potential and R&D capability of the city and broader northeastern China are attractive to overseas investors,"" he said."

The campus is located in an orchard in Changping district to ensure the children grow up in an environment that's close to nature.  The initial funding came from parents, who also offered to participate in the school's administration. The curriculum is based on the standardized, national system, but it also has a strong emphasis on traditional Chinese culture.  There are now preschool, primary and junior middle school divisions, and there are plans to open a high school division. A branch has also been established in Princeton, New Jersey.  As of September, the school had 115 teachers and more than 380 students.  : Xie Kang, a mother of two, was disappointed when she tried to find a school for her children. So in 2014, she set up AAI with a group of friends in Beijing who have academic backgrounds in pedagogy, psychology and musical education.  The school accepts children ages 4 to 6, plus those qualified to enroll in grades 1 to 3 at primary school. The children are taught in small classes, and lessons related to specific topics are often taught at appropriate venues, such as museums, galleries and factories.  : Located in a small yard in Beijing's Shunyi district, the school was launched in 2015 by an architectural designer and a group of friends.  The school has no fixed curriculum. Students are allowed to decide what they want to learn and achieve every day, encouraging them to discover, explore and summarize, in the hope of nurturing their problem-solving abilities.  AWU has four teachers and eight students, half at preschool level and half at primary."
1,"Beijing has warned that hegemonic thinking is behind the US Treasury Department's plan to restrict sensitive Chinese investments in the country's high-tech sector. Washington has taken a slew of moves recently, and what is behind the US restrictions is actually protectionism, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a daily news conference in Beijing on Friday. US Assistant Secretary for International Markets and Investment Policy Heath Tarbert told a forum on Thursday that Treasury officials are mulling ways to restrict sensitive Chinese investments by invoking an emergency powers law and bringing forward some security review reforms for corporate acquisitions, Reuters reported. Hua said the United States has demanded China further open up its market while imposing restrictions on Chinese investment in the US, a move that fails to live up to the principle of fairness and reciprocity and is an unreasonable, hegemonic approach in scientific fields. Also, the pace of China's advancing technological innovation will not be stopped because of the noise and interference, Hua added. Teng Jianqun, director of the Department for American Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, noted that behind the agenda of the administration of US President Donald Trump is its concern about China bringing changes to the existing global business order led by the US. Washington still is resisting China's remarkable boost in its own innovation capability in the high-tech sector and its advancing industrialization and transformation from medium-and low-end production status in the international production chain, Teng said. A US congressional committee report on Thursday claimed that the Chinese government is possibly supporting business espionage conducted by some Chinese companies. Hua Chunying responded that it is extremely irresponsible and dangerous if US policies are based only on possibilities. Traps and conspiracies plague minds dominated by Cold War thinking and belief in a zero-sum game, while a proactive and cooperative mindset helps create new opportunities and converts challenges into chances, Hua added. China hopes that some people in the US will update their ideas about international relations and follow the trend of the times rather than pushing against it, she said."
0,"A linear park in Chaoyang and Haidian districts of Beijing offers a magnificent example of healthy city infrastructure. Yuan Dynasty Capital City Wall Site Park runs more than 9 kilometers along an east-to-west canal between the North Third Ring and North Fourth Ring roads. In addition, a pedestrian tunnel at the east end connects to a 5-km-long walking path along a river. Assuming that the area around the park has the average urban Beijing population density of 6,000 people per square kilometer, 150,000 to 200,000 people live within a kilometer's walk from the park — and that's not counting the large number of people who work nearby. The park is adjacent to seven subway stations along four lines, so it's also easily reachable by public transportation. As great as it is, the park is not perfect. In the eastern section, there are tunnels under most crossing roads, but in the western section, users have to leave the park to cross roads. In addition, an eight- to 10-lane highway runs parallel to the north side of one section of the park. It is especially difficult for the elderly or infirm to reach the park by crossing this street at intersections. The walk signal lasts only 40 seconds, and aggressive drivers turning right or left often pose a danger to people in the crosswalk. In addition, motorcycles come from all directions. Unlike most linear parks, the park is not just a walking path. It averages roughly 130 to 160 meters wide, providing plenty of room for many kinds of sports or social activities. In the summer, abundant shade trees protect people from the hot sun, while in the spring, the blooming fruit trees are a popular attraction. Every day, thousands of people use the park. Elderly people exercise, meet friends, sing or take care of grandchildren. They practice tai chi, play badminton and do group calisthenics. Hikers and dog-walkers follow the path along the top of the old earthen wall. And people stroll or jog everywhere. At lunchtime, many office workers get in their daily steps, and since the park connects offices and residential areas, many people use it as a way to get to work or to a subway station. The wall was completed in 1276 during the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368), known in the West as the Mongol Empire. The park was established by the city in 1988 and rebuilt in 2003 to preserve the wall and provide green space for the people of Beijing. There are almost no tourists — people are just living their daily lives in the park. Many people say their daily exercise in the park is a key part of their lives. Guo Chaoying, who is 59, says she does not have any chronic diseases, maybe because she walks her dog for at least 10,000 steps each day. If she didn't have a dog, she might not force herself to walk so far, she says, but her dog has a strong desire to play in the park every morning. She also says physical exercise makes her emotions much better. David Evans, a professor at Beijing University of Chemical Technology, who is from England but has lived in Beijing for many years, says it is no fun walking on the roads, with all the electric bikes swarming around. But he is also glad to be motivated by his dog to take a healthy walk in the park each day. Han Yuguang, 62, says the park is a very big benefit to people's lives. Some play badminton, some sing, some walk. He says it is an especially important benefit for senior citizens. Among his badminton partners, one is 71, one is 75 and another is 81. If they didn't exercise, they wouldn't be healthy, he says. Han lives 10 kilometers away, in downtown Beijing, but he says there isn't a good place to exercise near his home. So he rides a bus fives days a week to the Yuan Dynasty park to play badminton and sing. A retired woman, who preferred not to give her name, says she comes to the park almost every day. If she stays home, there isn't much to do, so she comes to the park to exercise and meet with her friends. She says her emotions are much better because she is able to do this. Also in the park, a man surnamed Chen walks an hour each morning and an hour each evening. He takes his grandchild to the park during the day. He says life is based on exercise and the body is like a car — if not used, it will break down."
0,"Upcoming Chinese Valentine's Day, which falls this Friday, will turn out to be a money-spinner for the hospitality and tourism sector in the country, as The Paper reported on Friday, citing data from two major online travel agencies, which also showed that those born after 1995 were driving the festival consumption. According to Ctrip, hotel bookings over the period linked with the traditional romantic festival, or Qixi Festival, increased 200 percent compared with a year earlier, while nearly half of the reservations came from those in their early 20s, who preferred hotels rated high on social media. Couples in first-tier cities, such as Beijing and Shanghai, showed a stronger desire to celebrate the festival, and Hangzhou, Chengdu, Nanjing, Suzhou, Tianjin and Wuhan were among the top 10. Noticeably, 60 percent of hotel bookings were made by women. In the traveling front, the post-1995 generation also posted an upward streak in consumption this year, though those born in 1980s accounted for 41 percent of the total and those in their late 20s took up 29 percent, Tuniu's data revealed. The online travel services provider predicted that the week before the festival may see a bigger lift in the consumption by the post-1995, given the group's random spending habit. Major traveling consumers were from first- and second-tier cities, including Nanjing, Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Xi'an, Chengdu, Shenyang and Hangzhou, whereas orders from third and fourth cities with higher income, Yangzhou and Zhenjiang, Jiangsu province, for instance, posted a significant growth as well. In addition to popular outbound destination such as London, Prague, Kyoto, Paris and Madrid, islands with free-visa or landing-visa policy for Chinese tourists were welcome by young couples, such as Maldives, Phuket, Fiji and Bali, said Tuniu."
1,"You have probably heard of KFC. But in the internet lexicon, that catchphrase does not refer to the famous US fried chicken chain. It represents the initials of the slogan: ""Kaobei (the pinyin for copy) from China"".  Clearly, the country's shift from creating so-called technology clones to a genuine innovation powerhouse is no longer an aspiration, but a fact.  Case in point: Chinese e-commerce players not only generate big numbers in sheer transaction volume online but reshape the manufacturing process based on personalized needs and move to revamp physical retailing. This would help them gain an advantage over international rivals such as Amazon and eBay, which have just put stakes in this area.  Also, mobile wallets, initially designed to facilitate online transactions alone, have now penetrated civic services and wealth management, streamlining administration and enhancing efficiency. The likes of Alipay and WeChat Pay would not have envisioned to expand into a territory in an unprecedented scale and depth that was once dominated by the government and the elusive financial sector.  Indeed, China is already more digitized than many observers appreciate and has the potential to set the digital frontier in the coming decades.  Digital economy - one that features the use of the internet, cloud computing, big data, artificial intelligence in a variety of sectors - would contribute to 70 percent of the newly-added economic output this year. According to Tencent chairman Pony Ma, the digital economy will be key to helping China become a leading world power and enter the fourth industrial revolution.  Such ambition is best exemplified by numbers. According to global consultancy McKinsey, China is among the top three in the world for venture capital investment in key types of digital technology, from virtual reality, robotics to autonomous driving and 3-D printing. It dwarfed the United States as the biggest retail market last year, and seized a whopping 40 percent of global e-commerce transactions, up from a mere 1 percent a decade ago; One in three of the world's 262 unicorns (startups valued at over $1 billion) is Chinese, commanding 43 percent of the global value of these companies.  The list may go on, but the potential remains huge. Boston Consulting Group predicts that China's internet boom is likely to gather pace on the back of widespread mobile connectivity, the ability of China's biggest internet players to innovate quickly and its massive number of internet users who are keen to try out novel digital applications.  Among all these factors, government support is the key. As the export-led manufacturing model will inevitably run out of steam, new wealth and sustained growth can only be achieved from the innovation of industry through the application of information technology.  By mapping out plans and introducing incentives, the government has played an active role in building world-class infrastructure to support digitization and further drive the sector's development.  With the mantra of every corner in China today being ""innovation"" and ""entrepreneurship"", people have come to enjoy the perks of receiving parcels within 12 hours of an order being placed, unlocking a shared bike with a phone, and paying with your face at a cashier-less coffee booth.  Apart from subtle enhancements in life, internet has taken on more noble undertakings. Companies help farmers peddle their produce through e-commerce platforms and predict sales using algorithms and data analytics. Alibaba said 33 million people have thus become self-employed using its platforms, which is in line with the broad national goal of poverty reduction.  Besides, Beijing has envisioned linking up its manufacturing and infrastructure through the resource and logistical efficiency enabled by the internet. Major cloud operators are building industrial big data platforms for Chinese manufacturers that can connect their facilities globally. Using predictive analysis, such platforms can detect, avert or tackle glitches in real time, improving efficiency.  Finally, Chinese are conferring internet business models and know-hows to foreign players. From Singapore to Seattle to Sydney, consumers celebrate online shopping sprees, swipe virtual credit cards and ride shared bikes that all contain the Chinese gene.  Internet has indeed made the world flatter. China's experience show that it can be harnessed to enrich, enchant, entertain and empower a society, and perhaps beyond."
0,"Online streaming site iQiyi has paid a record 420 million yuan ($61.8 million) for the rights to remake China's all-time highest-grossing movie,   into a television series. Film and television production company Shanghai New Culture Media Group revealed in a regulatory filing that it had sold the exclusive online streaming rights to Beijing-based iQiyi. The blockbuster, written, produced and directed by Stephen Chow grossed 3.39 billion yuan at the box office when it was released in 2016. As well as being China's highest-grossing movie,   broke numerous box office records upon its release, including biggest opening day sales and biggest single day sales in its opening week. The movie tells the story of a playboy businessman who falls in love with a mermaid that has been sent to assassinate him. In a similar filing it has also been reported that iQiyi has purchased the online streaming rights to serialize another of Chow's movies, this time    which was released during Spring Festival this year. The deal emphasizes the impact streaming video on demand (SVOD) has had on the Chinese market. According to financial services firm JPMorgan Chase & Co, China's online subscribers for SVOD will hit 144 million this year, accounting for 26.9 percent of all digital video viewers. Similarly, SVOD companies such as iQiyi and Tencent have been capitalizing on the market to create more original content and increase revenues from subscribers instead of relying solely on advertisers. At an industry conference held in Beijing on June 9, iQiyi announced that it will connect its online movie business with its open platformto enable movie producers to take advantage of iQiyi's data analytics, artificial intelligence and marketing resources. Yang Xianghua, senior vice-president of iQiyi, said the decision redefines the way that movie producers can access their audiences. ""iQiyi will provide an open platform to connect content creators with viewers in a more intelligent manner and help them in content creation, operation as well as monetization,"" Yang said. ""By doing so, we can effectively lower the risks for content creators and share a vision with all of our partners."""
1,"A set of Chinese children's literature classics was published in Beijing last week. ""This is the first time that Chinese children's literature has been published in a systematic way, and it will fill a gap in the market,"" says Zhang Gaoli, the editor-in-chief of China Translation & Publishing House. The 16 books were published on Aug 22 to coincide with the Beijing International Book Fair. Children's literature is a thriving genre, yet only a handful of Chinese children literature writers are known in the world at large. These include Cao Wenxuan, the first Chinese winner of the Hans Christian Andersen award, and the nationally acclaimed children's storyteller Yang Hongying. ""We chose the most attractive stories from a range of modern Chinese children's literature,"" says Zhang. ""They reflect the core values and life of Chinese families."" The set comprises eight works and their English translations covering influential Chinese children's literature writers such as Jin Bo and Wu Meizhen. To ensure the quality of translation, the publisher says, it employed more than 10 translators and proofreaders, most of whom are scholars or have spent years doing Chinese translation studies. The project took two years to complete. Each book includes illustrations and a QR Code on the back cover that gives access to audio tracks of the stories that can be heard on phone. Speaking about the work, Wang Quangen, chief editor of the series and a professor at Beijing Normal University, says: ""Children's literature reflects truth, virtue and beauty common to all nations, so it has no borders."" Wei Yushan, the head of the China Academy of Press and Publication, says: ""It's not just for children in Western countries, but also for Chinese children growing up overseas. ""The stories are rooted in traditional culture. They are like breast milk for these children to sustain their bond with their motherland."" Children's literature was one of the highlights of the Beijing book fair, held from Aug 22 to 26, with a special section for children held for the first time. Meanwhile, Dang Dang, an online shopping platform in China, says it sold 410 million children's titles last year, 60 percent more than in 2016. The value of sales of children's literature books alone was 1 billion yuan ($146 million), accounting for 18 percent of the value of children's book sales, it says. Xue Tao, one of the writers whose work is included in the series, says that purity and love among other characteristics of children's stories touch readers regardless of their race or nationality. His book September Glacier featured in the series is set on the China-Russia border and tells the story of a Chinese boy, a Russian boy and a dog befriending one another and experiencing joy and pain together. Explaining the significance of the series, Zhang says: ""With the Belt and Road Initiative, people in many countries are keen to learn about Chinese culture. So the demand for Chinese literature is rising. ""And we plan to tap into the demand by translating our children's stories into more languages."" In March, Zhang attended the Bologna Children's Book Fair in Italy, where China was the main guest country. Speaking about the future, Zhang says he is delighted that Chinese children's literature is at last gaining international recognition, but adds that he is aware of the long road ahead as China looks to internationalize such literature in the way that many Western countries have. ""The gap lies in the way we present our stories. ""We clearly have great stories to tell, but we need to better combine form and content, such as the way we use images and audio, and develop these stories into copyright material."" For now, China Translation& Publishing House has set up 16 China-themed international editorial departments to improve how it selects what it wants to publish. ""Chinese children's literature mirrors the values of the Chinese nuclear family,"" says Zhang. ""It represents our characteristics and attitudes to life and nature. ""We hope the publication of this bilingual set of children's books not only introduces our culture to the world, but also gives people a useful perspective as they observe China and learn about it."""
1,"BEIJING -- Beijing courts resolved 36,800 cases concerning intellectual property rights (IPR) in 2017, more than doubled the number in 2013. Yang Wanming, head of Beijing's higher people's court, announced the number when delivering a work report at the capital city's ongoing legislative session. During the past five years, Beijing courts solved more than 125,000 IPR cases, a fifth of the country's total, Yang said. Nearly 5,300 of the case from 2013 to 2017 were patent disputes. The city will establish a center this year dedicated to providing IPR services to high-tech companies. The center will offer fast-track services for patent applications to companies in information technology and high-end equipment production, two areas with high demand. At the frontline of China's fight against IPR infringement, Beijing set up the country's first IPR court in 2014."

During the same period of time, the authority received 42,829 public tip-offs through letters and visits, an increase of 31 percent year-on-year, according to the commission. Chen Mingjie, spokesperson of the commission, said the rise is a result of intensified supervision. “Beijing has achieved effective results on anti-corruption with a continuous high pressure on violations,” he said, adding the commission has improved their working mechanism by increasing online channels for public complaints and investigating deeply on every corruption case. A total of 576 government officials who have violated the “eight-point frugality rules” were punished from January to November, an increase of 45 percent compared with the same period last year, according to the commission. In December 2012, China's central leadership issued the “eight-point rules”, requiring government officials to strictly practice frugality and clean up undesirable work styles such as formalism, bureaucratism, hedonism and extravagance. Practices such as the use of public funds to buy gifts, hold banquets and pay for holidays have since been strictly banned. Chen said the commission will step up efforts against hedonism and extravagance during the upcoming New Year and Spring Festival holidays. He said inspection work will focus on county and township governments, to avoid corruption in the grassroots. Li Shixin, spokesman of the Organization Department of the Beijing Committee of the Communist Party of China, said the department will establish an information database of clean government officials jointly with the discipline commission to better choose and supervise public servants."

1,"China's scientific start-ups incubator, Techcode SME Services Co Ltd, recently announced the establishment of the company's first global scientific achievements experience center in Langfang of North China's Hebei province.  The center, Techcode Langfang, will be designed to help promote the commercialization of research findings of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region.  Founded in 2015, Techcode SME Services Co Ltd has, so far, 30 incubators in seven different countries. The centers incubate more than 600 start-ups, with a total financing worth more than $500 million.  Langfang, located at the center of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, between Beijing and Tianjin, was designed to become a cluster for the commercialization of research findings in the future. The city would have an enhanced linkage with Beijing and Tianjin in terms of industries, assets and policies, according to a Langfang government report released in April. Techcode Langfang would provide spaces for the exhibition of scientific and technological achievements worldwide, as well as the trading of research findings, and provide space for entrepreneurs from across the globe to exchange ideas. More than 10 artificial intelligence companies from the Silicon Valley displayed their products at the launch ceremony of the Techcode Langfang on May 16, which enabled each company to seek possible investment in China. These companies included The One, an organization which could calculate return on investment for enterprises, and CoContest, which could combine the 3D and visual reality technology to do interior design. Huang Haiyan, CEO of Techcode, said the company was determined to bring the best resources together, through the use of globalization, and realize its potential in China.

0,"BEIJING -- President Xi Jinping on Friday visited Beijing's primary-level cadres and residents in downtown neighborhoods ahead of the Spring Festival and extended Lunar New Year greetings to Chinese people of all ethnic groups. Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, also inspected the preparation work for the Beijing 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games. When inspecting the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau, Xi stressed the city's glorious mission and weighty responsibility to safeguard the social stability of the national capital as 2019 marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Xi asked for coordinated efforts to promote work in all fields with resolve to complete the mission. Touring a ""hutong,"" or traditional alley, in central Beijing's Qianmen area, Xi ordered the efforts to protect cultural heritage sites and conserve traditional culture while renovating the city's old areas. He called for both improving local residents' living conditions and protecting historical and cultural deposits, so that history and modernity will perfectly blend. He stressed specific measures to maintain the original features of hutong areas. Xi dropped into two courtyards along the hutong, inquiring about the living conditions of local residents after the renovation projects in the neighborhood. ""What the CPC pursues is to make the people's life better,"" he told the residents, gladly chatting and making dumplings with them. Noting close attention from the CPC Central Committee to the renovation of old towns and shanty areas, Xi said that the Party aims to create a more comfortable and better living environment for the people and solve problems they care about most so that they can enjoy modern life even in old hutong areas. After chatting with residents, Xi went to a property service center to visit staff and community workers. On the way back, Xi dropped in on a restaurant, chatted with the owner and some customers and wished them good luck. Xi also called on a nearby express delivery station and visited the deliverymen who were on duty, stressing that priority should be given to solving employment problems and creating more jobs. At 3:30 pm, Xi arrived at the Shougang Park in Shijingshan district, the seat of the Beijing Organizing Committee for the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games, to learn about the preparation for the Games and the planning and construction of the venues and infrastructure. Xi stressed the need to stay committed to hosting the Games in a green, sharing, open and clean manner, and to complete all preparation tasks with high standards. The venue construction must meet the Olympic standards and be completed on time, Xi said. Stressing that the features of technology, intelligence, greenness and frugality should be highlighted, Xi said advanced technological approaches should be applied, energy-saving and environmental friendly requirements should be strictly enforced, the environment and cultural relics should be well protected, and Chinese styles should be on full display. Xi visited the office building of the Beijing Organizing Committee, meeting with some of the staff and volunteers there. Noting that Beijing will become the world's only host of both the Summer and Winter Olympics, he stressed that China must fulfill the solemn commitments it made to the world. ""Hosting the 2022 Winter Olympics is an important support to the coordinated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region,"" Xi said, adding that Hebei Province must develop together with Beijing. During his visit to the national winter sports training center, Xi stressed promoting sportsmanship with Chinese characteristics, boosting coordinated development of mass sports, competitive sports and the sports industry, and speeding up building China into a country strong on sports. Vice Premier Han Zheng, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, accompanied Xi on the inspection tour of the preparation work for the Beijing 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games."
1,"After a period of explosive growth, the financial technology - or fintech - sector in China will likely see slower but more regulated growth, with greater emphasis on leveraging technology to drive true innovation, analysts said.  China has emerged as a leading fintech market globally, with analysts estimating the market size to have exceeded $243 billion by the end of last year, accounting for about 85 percent of the global market share.  The sector's fast and furious growth was also illustrated by the surge of fintech investment in the country, which attracted capital of $8.8 billion between July 2015 to June 2016, equivalent to an increase of 252 percent since 2010, according to a report by Singaporean banking giant DBS Group and global accounting firm Ernst & Young.  Chinese fintech companies have been thriving through meeting the market's growing demand for financial services that are underserved by the country's traditional banking sector.  Internet giants such as Alibaba Group and Tencent Holdings have made a name for themselves both at home and internationally with their third-party electronic payment services, as well as the online wealth management products.  Peer-to-peer lending, small and micro loan services, as well as online insurance sales, have also flourished by taking advantage of the rapid digitalization and explosive online and mobile penetration in China.  Behind the sector's phenomenal growth were rising risks and irregularities that have alerted the country's financial regulators. Stringent measures have been adopted by the regulators, aiming to incorporate the fintech sector into the country's financial regulatory framework. New rules have also been drafted to tackle financial fraud and protect the interests of smaller investors and players in the sector.  One example is the tightened regulation of internet-based micro loan services. Media reports said that the People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, has suspended the approval of applications for setting up new online micro-loan lending services.    Analysts believe that the torrid growth of China's fintech sector will inevitably slow, which will present both challenges and opportunities for the companies, especially as more mature regulations are imposed, and a degree of consolidation may take place.  Chen Huan, chief strategy officer of CreditEase Group, a Beijing-based financial technology firm and peer-to-peer lending platform, said that the future trend of the fintech will put an emphasis on greater standardization, professionalism and a scale-driven business model.  ""In essence, the fintech companies and the traditional financial institutions are the same. The key is whether you have better means to obtain data and information so that you can know your clients better and be able to provide various services,"" Chen said.  Cliff Sheng, partner and head of financial services for Oliver Wyman Greater China, said that future fintech companies will differentiate themselves by pushing the frontiers of technological innovation as the window of regulatory arbitrage closes.  Big-data analytics, the internet of things and blockchain are the three most representative technologies, owing to their ground-breaking capabilities to acquire, assemble, analyze and apply information, according to Sheng.  ""With the ongoing integration of fintech into the regulatory framework, we believe the development of fintech in China has reached a turning point. From now, technology will be the key driver of valuechain disruption in an increasingly data-driven industry,"" Sheng said in a report.  China will continue to dominate the global fintech industry with a very strong domestic market, analysts with DBS Group and E&Y said in the report.  Capital investment will pour in and the market is being bolstered by substantial government support for innovation, they said, adding that demand will continue to be driven by underserved small and medium-sized companies and tech-savvy, often unbanked, consumers keen to access financial services via their mobile phones."

That was announced by the travel agency at a product launch event which was attended by representatives from airlines, tourism administrations, consulates and embassies. The agency, founded in 1993, has cooperated with the national tourism administrations in Australia, Canada, Ireland, Singapore and other countries and boasts 25 subsidiaries across China.,Speaking about the agency's prospects, He Yong, CEO of HCG Travel Group, says: ""Outbound tourism in China has been burgeoning since the year 2000,"" adding that the agency had sent over 300,000 tourists to Europe by the end of last year. He adds that to further improve sevices, the agency has set up a quality management system to collect customer feedback."
1,"China will evaluate the influence of the renewed threat of restrictions the United States has placed on Chinese investment and exports and will reserve the right to take countermeasures, the Ministry of Commerce said on Thursday. The recently announced US restrictions do not conform to the basic principles and spirit of the World Trade Organization, ministry spokesman Gao Feng said at a regular news conference on Thursday. He said China does not want to see bilateral trade friction escalate and believes the two countries have a huge potential for cooperation based on extended common interests. On Tuesday, the White House said it would place investment restrictions and tougher export controls on Chinese people and entities purchasing industrially significant technology in order to ensure US national security. Even though trade tensions between China and the US had appeared to cool down following talks in Washington and the two countries issued a joint statement on May 20, the administration of US President Donald Trump said it would announce the list of imports subject to tariffs and proposed investment restrictions on China by June 15 and June 30 respectively. Gao said China is always open for talks and confirmed that a US trade delegation of more than 50 people arrived in Beijing. He hoped that the two countries' negotiating teams would meet each other halfway and facilitate the consensus reached in Washington days ago. James Gorman, chairman and chief executive of US investment bank Morgan Stanley, said it is worth noting that the US-China trade disputes are taking place within a broader global context of the US having trade discussions with the European countries, talking about redefining the North American Free Trade Agreement and having withdrawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement. ""I believe in open markets and free trade around the world. I think it's constructive to the largest economy in the world to find a solution to trade disputes without them becoming a major economic crisis,"" Gorman said. While the Trump administration follows an ""America First"" agenda, China has been promoting global free trade and ramping up domestic reforms, the American Chamber of Commerce in China said in the 2018 American Business in China White Paper released on Wednesday. The white paper said US companies in China are more optimistic and confident in growth, thanks to continuous efforts by the Chinese government to improve the business environment for foreign companies. As was pointed out at the State Council's executive meeting on Wednesday, China's domestic consumption will surpass that of the US this year, and visionary companies will not want to miss the prospect of the Chinese market, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a news briefing on Thursday. Trade experts suggest that China should respond in kind to the Trump administration's renewed threats of tariffs on Chinese goods. Mei Xinyu, a researcher at the Commerce Ministry's International Trade and Economic Cooperation Institute, said, ""China can accept measures that comply with international rules, but it will not accept those coming from another country's domestic law."" ""We must prepare for all possible contingencies to deal with the Trump administration's capricious acts,"" Mei said. ""External interference by the US cannot deter China's pace of further opening and upgrading its economy,"" said Chen Wenling, chief economist at the China Center for International Economic Exchanges. Such continual efforts are not driven by external pressure of trade conflicts, she said, but underpinned by China's firm stance to further enrich and diversify the national economy via reform and opening-up policies."

0,"Lawyer Xu Fenfen encountered her first criminal case involving a fatality when she was an intern at China's top court last year. A master's student with Zhejiang University at the time, she was among some 40 people selected for internships at the Supreme People's Court from February to August. She said she was grateful for the opportunity, and the six months she spent there showed her the importance of helping people. Xu spent her internship working for the court's Trial Supervision Tribunal, mainly helping judges deal with matters such as taking notes at meetings and writing reports after reviewing cases. The tribunal specializes in reviewing influential cases with complicated facts or those in which inmates serving suspended death sentences commit further crimes while in custody. ""At the beginning, I was too frightened to turn to the next page when I saw photos of the body in material to do with the case,"" the 25-year-old lawyer said. ""I was timid, but I had to read, because my tutor judge asked me to comment after the review."" Xu said being an intern had been more challenging than she had imagined. ""The internship was not an easy job that could be idled away,"" she said. The Supreme People's Court began the internship program in July 2015 to increase communication and cooperation between courts and law schools, which the central leadership had called for two years earlier, and to cultivate legal talent. More than 200 interns have worked at the top court since then. The court says interns should be recommended by universities or colleges, and work with judges in handling civil, criminal, administrative and State compensation cases. The time they spend as interns ranges from three to six months. Hu Shihao, head of the court's department for judicial reforms, said jobs were classified according to students' interests and could improve their ability to solve legal problems. Xu, who became an intern on Feb 14, 2017, said she did not know why she had to view photos of the body when reviewing the case, as she had already studied the autopsy report. ""But my tutor judge told me to be prudent and to compare the injuries in the pictures with those in the report to double check whether they were the same, as it was a case involving a death,"" Xu remembered. ""Since then, the need to be precise and cautious when reviewing criminal cases has been highlighted in my mind."" After handling several similar cases, she was no longer afraid of seeing such photos and could calmly analyze them with colleagues. Xu said she became addicted to criminal law after discovering that a crime could influence a suspect's life, and even change it completely. ""I wanted to use my legal knowledge to save the innocent and also to push forward the rule of law in our country,"" she said. To pursue that dream, Xu moved to Beijing after graduation and is now a criminal lawyer at a law firm in the capital. Sun Liang was a postgraduate law student at Beijing's Tsinghua University when he served as an intern at the court's No 1 Criminal Tribunal from October 2015 to March 2016. He helped judges collect case materials, research criminal topics and write reports on whether death penalties handed down by lower courts should be approved. He said the experience was unforgettable. Now 29, he works as a judicial assistant at Beijing Tongzhou District People's Court. Sun said he decided to begin his career by working at the low-level court due to the influence of Ran Rong, a judge at the tribunal. ""It was Ran who let me know the importance of the rule of law, telling me it should be fulfilled step by step,"" he said, adding the judge never complained about her workload and taught him not to take small matters for granted. At the beginning of his internship, for example, he often replied ""no comment"" when he received a case or project he was unfamiliar with. ""But the judge told me I should give an answer after searching for information about the new aspects, as it was not only the work attitude, but also a chance to fill my knowledge gap,"" he said. He had also complained early on about spelling mistakes made by court clerks. ""But after I was asked to record the information of a case hearing, I realized it was too hard to ensure everything was accurate,"" Sun said. ""Going through the notes and correcting mistakes after the trial is a must, no matter what they are."" Such matters might appear insignificant, but Ran always took them seriously, teaching Sun to respect each task and learn from them. When he finished his internship, she shared three tips with him: have a dream, work hard, and be a better man. Although Sun is kept busy by the rising number of cases handled by the district court, he said he could shoulder the burden because it was something he had learned from Ran. Yuan Gang, an associate law professor at China University of Political Science and Law, welcomed the top court's internship program, saying it reduced the distance between law schools and the judicial authorities, helped students put their knowledge into practice and improved the cultivation of legal talent. He said the United States, some European countries and Japan placed a great deal of emphasis on combining legal education with practice. In Germany and France, for example, law students can only qualify as lawyers if they spent at least two years as interns at judicial or administrative organs or law firms, Yuan said. In Japan, law students who wanted to work in field were asked to complete a one-year internship at an institute established by the country's highest court, he added. Zou Jiaming, a criminal lawyer at King and Capital Law Firm in Beijing, said: ""Practice is essential for law school students. Many law graduates don't know how to communicate with judges and how to question their litigants, although they perform well in schools. ""Graduation doesn't mean they can be competent at legal jobs."" Yuan suggested the top court specify projects for interns, with tasks given to postgraduate students different from those given to undergraduates. Sun said developing a long-term relationship with former interns could boost the effectiveness of study and help solve legal problems thoroughly. ""If the top court could follow our growth and receive our feedback after we leave there, I think it will help improve the internship program,"" he said."
0,"The Beijing Symphony Orchestra performs a concert to mark the 40th anniversary of China's reform and opening-up. At the ongoing Beijing Music Festival－an annual event featuring world-class musicians and concerts, the Beijing Symphony Orchestra led by conductor Tan Lihua gave a performance called Embracing the New Era: Chinese Music Concert, to mark the 40th anniversary of China's reform and opening-up, at the Forbidden City Concert Hall in the capital. The first half of the concert featured three pieces by Chinese composers: Yang Qing's Symphonic Poem: The Narration of Beijing; Chen Peixun's Aira of Snow and the fourth movement of Bao Yuankai's Peking Opera Symphony. According to Tan, the artistic director and conductor of the orchestra and vice-president of the Chinese Musicians' Association, the repertory focused on massive changes in China since the reform and opening-up began. ""In the past 40 years we have not only performed Western classical music works, but also devoted ourselves to writing our own music,"" Tan says. ""In the last four decades, a large amount of original Chinese music was created and we feel proud that these works have not only been performed in China, but have also been performed by international orchestras."" Symphonic Poem: The Narration of Beijing was written by Chinese composer Yang, a classmate of Tan at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, for the Beijing Symphony Orchestra to mark the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. Tan, who premiered the work in 2008 with the Beijing Symphony Orchestra, says: ""It uses local nursery rhymes and qinshu, a traditional art form that combines storytelling, singing and music instruments. ""The music unfolds bit by bit, and is a tribute to Beijing and its people."" As for Bao's symphony, it contains four movements: Jing－The Painted Face, A Solemn Andante; Chou－The Comedian, A Humorous Presto; Dan－The Lady, A Profound Largo and Sheng－The Man, A Brillante Allegro. With the techniques of Western classical music composition, the work is based on four different role types in Peking Opera－the 200-year-old traditional Chinese art form that combines singing, dancing and martial arts. The piece was also commissioned by the orchestra and premiered in 2006 by Tan in Beijing. Speaking about his work, Bao, 74, who was born in Beijing and graduated from the Central Conservatory of Music in 1967, says: ""I wanted to present the profound and rich spiritual world of Peking Opera through classical music."" Bao, who took almost a year to complete his Peking Opera Symphony, says he used to listen to Peking Opera as a child and was always interested in painting Peking Opera characters. Commenting on Bao's work, Tan says: ""Thanks to his (Bao's) interpretation, audiences from different cultures can enjoy the beauty and spirit of Peking Opera."" Bao says that despite the development of classical music in China in the past 40 years, he is concerned that Chinese traditional music has not been promoted as greatly as Western classical music. ""Music schools in China put a lot of effort into Western classical music rather than traditional Chinese music. It's harmful for our culture,"" says Bao. The second half of the concert was Embracing the New Era Symphonic Suit, a special arrangement by Chinese composer Dong Yuexuan, who adapted popular Chinese songs, including On the Hopeful Field, Pearl of the East and I Love You, China. The songs, Tan says, represent the big events in China over the past 40 years. For example, On the Hopeful Field celebrates the start of the reform and opening-up and Pearl of the East marks the handover of Hong Kong in 1997. Looking back over the past four decades, Tan says classical music has developed very quickly in China. Before 1978, there were four symphony orchestras in China but now the number is more than 80 across the country. ""The reform and opening-up made China powerful and changed people's lives. ""The booming classical music scene means that the Chinese composers now want to write more original material,"" says Tan."

1,"A group of people were given sentences ranging from 54 months to 14 years in prison by Beijing No 3 Intermediate People's Court for making and selling counterfeit currency, Beijing News reported on Tuesday. The four defendants, surnamed Guo, Zhou, Zhang and Huang, were identified having produced fake money with face value of more than 670,000 yuan ($99,059), the report said. The forged money and a set of devices for making the currency were seized when the group was detained in a village in the capital's Yanqing district on March 11, 2018, it said. The four were charged with the crimes of making and selling fake money by the No 3 branch of Beijing People's Procuratorate on Jan 19. Prosecutors said Guo and Zhou were taxi drivers, and began playing cards and gambling after meeting Zhang in 2013. The three decided to forge money as Guo and Zhou owed gambling debts. Guo and Zhou called Huang to join the group because Huang had some fake money samples, which could help them counterfeit, the prosecutors said. The defendants offered forged currency to those driving taxies at night, and that money was then given to passengers as change, according to the prosecutors. Their offense was discovered after a passenger called police last February, the prosecutors added. Guo, Zhou and Huang were sentenced to 14, 13 and 12 years in prison respectively for making counterfeit money, while Zhang was sentenced to four years and six months for making and selling the forgeries."
0,"Over the weekend, Wang Fuman spent three days in Beijing living his dreams. The 8-year-old, known online as ""Snowflake Boy"", met his idols-the Beijing SWAT team-and took a class at China's top police academy. On Monday night, he returned to reality in his impoverished village in Yunnan province, where he lives with his father, older sister and grandmother. His mother walked out over two years ago. When the now-famous image of Wang with his head covered in icicles went viral this month, it attracted national and even international attention to the plight of children living in poverty. The frosty hairdo was the result of Wang walking more than 4 kilometers to reach school in subzero temperatures. The story also illustrated a deeper trend, which is the sheer number of children in poor rural areas who are growing up without mothers, a situation educators and experts warn can often have long-lasting effects on a child's mental health and life prospects. Wang and his family arrived in the capital on Friday on a trip arranged by chinapeace.gov.cn, a website affiliated with the Commission for Political and Legal Affairs of the Communist Party of China Central Committee. The boy, who dreams of becoming a police officer one day, was given a tour of the SWAT team's headquarters and the People's Public Security University of China. The giant city must have seemed on a different planet from his village, Zhuanshanbao, which is home to 540 families, almost half of whom live below the poverty line of 2,952 yuan ($463) in annual earnings. Fu Heng, principal of Zhuanshanbao Lihuimiaopu Primary School, where Wang is one of 140 students, said at least eight of the children never see their mothers. Observations by China Daily reporters who have covered stories in impoverished areas nationwide suggest the problem is not an isolated one. Li Yifei, a professor at Beijing Normal University's Faculty of Education who has conducted extensive studies of children in rural China, said now villagers are free to travel more widely than ever before in search of employment opportunities, the incidence of broken families has soared. The problem is often exacerbated because many migrant worker parents who experience city life are unwilling to return to their rundown villages or their spouses, he added.,While both mothers and fathers are raising children in single-parent families, anecdotal evidence suggests that women account for the majority of people who end marriages and leave impoverished areas. Wang Gangming, head of Zhuanshanbao village, told Beijing News that women from other areas who marry local men often struggle to cope with the bad weather and poor conditions. In most cases, he said, they simply leave. Moreover, many villagers fail to obtain official marriage certificates, so their unions are not legal. That means women can leave without going through regular divorce proceedings, he added. In the countryside, it is traditional for women to move into their husband's home after marriage, which usually means living with his parents and even grandparents. Many women find it difficult to adjust to the new situation, and in the event of marital disputes, it is unlikely the family will be sympathetic to the wife's cause. Without family support, the situation can take such a heavy toll that some women see no option other than leaving home. However, ultimately, their children are the real victims, according to Li. ""Living in poverty will make a child unhappy about their immediate life, but growing up without a mother or a father can also make them feel hopeless about the future,"" he said. ""Those combined factors could make them suicidal or even want to somehow take revenge in later life, which may result in severe social problems when these children reach adulthood."" Last year, Li conducted a study of the psychological conditions of children in rural areas who are growing up without one or both parents. ""Although there are similarities, the impact on children who grow up in single-parent and poor families is obviously more pronounced than for 'left-behind children', those growing up in the countryside who rarely see their parents who are migrant workers in distant cities,"" he said. ""The psychological trauma is more severe and their behavior is more extreme."" Fu, the school principal, has noticed that students from broken families, especially those without a mother, quickly start displaying both positive and negative responses, but the negative effects are ""much stronger"". His observations show that these students are more independent and stronger than their peers. ""For example, they can cook and do heavy housework on their own, and can even look after the whole family,"" he said. ""They don't want to be independent like that; they just don't have a choice."" Fu, who originally shared the ""Snowflake Boy"" photo on social media, said he did so because he was not only struck by Wang Fuman's appearance, but also by the boy's stoic attitude. However, he added that students in Wang's situation usually perform poorly in coursework and also tend to be introverted and stubborn. They may even exhibit extreme behavior. ""One of the things that hurts them most is being called 'motherless' by other students. Sometimes they don't react immediately, but they bear grudges and later throw punches at the people who made the comment,"" he said.,When asked by a reporter in Beijing if he misses his mother, Wang responded calmly. ""No. I don't think about her anymore because my heart would be broken again if I did,"" he said. As a result of its remote location and poor transportation infrastructure, Zhuanshanbao is one of the poorest villages in Xinjie township. Wang Gangkui, 28, the boy's father, works on a construction site. He said his wife, Lu Dafeng, asked for a divorce at the end of 2015 because she could no longer bear their impoverished existence, especially as the family was in debt. Wang Gangkui refused Lu's request, so several days later she left home without telling anyone. Her husband tried to contact her, but Lu had changed her cellphone number. ""Fuman and his sister cried a lot after discovering that their mother had gone. They really wanted her to come back, but I lied and told them that she had left to look for work elsewhere,"" he said. Lu returned to the village in July. Once again, she asked for a divorce, and once again Wang Gangkui refused. Lu disappeared again three days later. The children cried again, and this time, Wang Gangkui told them that their mother had left them for good. ""After their mother left for the second time, the children stopped saying they missed her. They just wouldn't talk about it or cry for her like the first time,"" Wang Gangkui said.,Although Wang Fuman said he no longer thinks about his mother, the traumatic experience may cast a shadow over his life or even change it irrevocably, as happened to Tan Denghong. Tan, a resident of Yumuzhai village, Hubei province, was 9 years old when his mother left their poverty-stricken family and never returned. ""She left because of the poverty. When she left, we didn't even have enough to eat,"" said the 39-year-old, who quit school shortly after his mother disappeared. When he was 12, Tan left the village in Moudao township, and traveled to Guangdong province to look for work. Without parental care, he quickly went off the rails and began mixing with a bad crowd. ""My mother left and my father could not support me. I often felt hopeless and soon I just gave up hope,"" he said. When he was 16, Tan moved to Jiangsu province, where he joined a gang of thieves. Luckily, he managed to turn his life around and returned to his poverty-stricken village in 2008, following in his father's footsteps by raising goats. He is not the only person in the village whose mother left because they could not bear the poverty. ""I have not seen my mother since she left. Time has clouded my memories of her, but of course I miss her. After all, she gave me life,"" he said., Wang Fuman received star treatment as soon as he arrived in Beijing. He was followed by news crews and constantly stopped by people on the streets who wanted their photo taken with him. While the boy enjoyed the attention, his father expressed concern. ""Nothing will change. We will still be poor and his mother still won't contact us,"" said Wang Gangkui, who rarely spoke during their trip to Beijing. ""People will soon forget about us; I wonder how long that will take."" Fu, the headmaster, was also worried about the effect the trip may have had on Wang Fuman. ""The media has focused on him too much in recent days, and that's not good for him. He should return to his normal life,"" he said. However, Li, the professor at Beijing Normal University, said the visit to the capital may have been beneficial because it may have given Wang Fuman a sense of purpose and something to aspire to. ""We should not forget that there are so many children like him in China. Only poverty alleviation can help to reduce the number of parents leaving their children in the countryside, and provide children with a healthier environment to grow up in,"" he said. Wang Fuman, who seemed almost unaffected by the attention, said he prefers to be called by his real name rather than ""Snowflake Boy"". The third grader has never missed a day of school, no matter how many times he has fallen on the slippery mountain road or been ridiculed because his mother has left the family. ""I just want to study as hard as I can so I can become a real policeman and take down bad people in the world,"" he said. Hou Liqiang contributed to this story."
1,"A travel rush is expected for the upcoming May Day holiday, as air tickets and high-speed railway tickets on multiple routes were sold out, while homestay hotels at destinations including Beijing and Shanghai were fully booked. While only one week away, the May Day holiday this year is extended to four days – one day more than last year – and will see a travel craze comparable to that typically seen during China's Spring Festival, a traditional holiday for family reunion. According to Qunar, one of China's largest online travel agencies, quite a few people chose to take a few days off before or after the May 1 to 4 holiday, so that they can enjoy a journey lasting upwards to nine days. The travel rush is expected to come as early as April 27, and will reach a climax on April 29 and 30. To be specific, economy class tickets for flights, such as Beijing to Tokyo or Osaka on April 30 and May 1, and Shanghai to Dubai on May 1, have been sold out, Qunar statistics showed. For domestic trips, travelers have to pay full fare for economy class tickets for flights linking Beijing with Kunming, Xi'an and Hangzhou; Shanghai with Chongqing, Sanya and Haikou; and Chengdu with Shenzhen, Hangzhou and Xiamen. High-speed railway tickets to popular destinations, including Huangshan, Wuhan, Chongqing and Dalian, also are gone. Qunar said that the most popular overseas destinations for the May Day holiday include Singapore, Seoul, Taipei, Bali, Osaka, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, Tokyo and Dubai, depending on the length of the individual traveler's holiday. Ctrip, the country's biggest online travel agency and a shareholder in Qunar, said earlier that Chinese residents will make an estimated 160 million trips during the upcoming May Day holiday. The figure is about 50 percent higher than that for Tomb-sweeping holiday, which was from April 5 to 7."
0,"A genome study of more than 140,000 Chinese has found a gene locus associated with twin pregnancy, Beijing News reported. The largest of its kind for the Chinese population to date, the study was conducted by Shenzhen-based Beijing Genomics Institute and published in the international academic journal Cell on Oct 4. The team analyzed two traits - maternal age and twin pregnancy, and found a mutation locus on gene NRG1 that is significantly related with twin pregnancy, meaning a woman has more probability to conceive twins if she carries a mutation on gene NRG1. Everyone has gene NRG1, but some people have mutation on a specific location on this gene, said Liu Siyang, the first author of the article published on Cell. Beijing Genomics Institute said it would invest more on the study and expand the samples to one million from the current 140,000, contributing to birth defects prevention and control, tumor study, and medicine research and development in China."

Luo said the Chinese and British libraries' cooperation boosts cultural exchanges and communications between the two nations, which should continue to deepen relations. Organized by the National Library of China and the British Library, a series of lectures and talks will go along with the exhibition until June 21."
0,"A tourism milestone will be reached next year with an initiative between China and the European Union, said the chief representative of the China National Tourism Administration in the United Kingdom. China-EU Tourism Year fits well with China's aim to attract more European visitors, said Kuang Lin, who was speaking ahead of the World Travel Market, an international travel trade show running in London until Wednesday. Kuang said China has become the fourth most popular destination for tourists, drawing around 138 million visits last year, a 3.5 percent rise on the previous year. In addition to favorite cities like Beijing, Xi'an, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Guilin, Kuang said tourists are also now visiting such places as Shangri-La, cruising on the Yangtze River and traveling on the Qinghai-Tibet Railway. In 2016, more than 594,000 British tourists visited China, one of the largest groups from among European countries. ""Over the past 15 years, the market has achieved a steady growth of nearly 5 percent per year,"" said Li Gang, a professor of tourism economics at the University of Surrey. He said he believes the number of British tourists will continue to rise. James Kennell, principal lecturer in tourism at the University of Greenwich, said China is still a great unknown for potential British visitors. He suggested China's national tourism agency raises the country's tourism profile by funding television programs, and developing greater travel trade and media awareness of China through public relations efforts, paid-for-content and familiarization trips. ""Hosting large events with an international television audience and making use of celebrity endorsements is vital for a contemporary destination seeking to raise awareness in new markets,"" he said. Kuang said the administration is working closely with new media companies to keep building the brand ""Beautiful China"" and to make China a more popular travel destination. Peter Ball, a video editor from Guisborough in Northeast England, spent five days in China in 2015, during which he visited the Lijiang River in the south and took a high-speed train to Beijing, where he toured the Palace Museum, also known as the Forbidden City, and took a trip to the Great Wall. ""China is a massive country with lots of famous natural and historical sites to visit,"" he said. ""It's also a nation that is changing rapidly and has an ever-increasing role to play in the world, so that's why I wanted to visit."""
0,"The chance of getting a new car registration in Beijing reached a record low this month because of an increase in applicants for the license plate lottery, combined with a reduced quota. According to data from the capital's Transport Commission, more than 2.8 million applicants participated in the lottery on Monday to get a license for a conventional car in Beijing. The government gave out 6,333 licenses in the lottery, which meant the chance was 1 in 2,031 - slightly worse odds than for the lottery in April, which was 1 in 1,963. Li Bin, 33, an IT engineer who has participated in the lottery for five years, said the success rate made no difference to him. ""No matter whether it's 1 in 2,031 or 1 in 1,963, it means nothing to me,"" he said. ""I don't think I can get a plate anytime soon. So, I applied for a new energy vehicle license and gave up trying for a gas or diesel car, even though I really love driving a gas car."" Not that it is much easier to get a license for an electric car. According to data from the commission, about 280,000 people have applied for licenses for e-vehicles in Beijing, which means new applicants will be eligible in 2024 at the earliest. During Monday's lottery, 4,135 people who failed to comply with court orders were barred from entering, a practice that started in April, when 4,017 defaulters were barred. The capital introduced an annual quota for new car registrations in 2011 to ease traffic congestion and combat smog. For the past two years, the cap has been set at 90,000 licenses for conventional vehicles, available only by entering a monthly draw, and 60,000 for new energy vehicles, which are distributed on a first-come, first-served basis. The municipal government has cut the quota for gas and diesel cars by more than half to 40,000, an attempt to control the growing number of cars on the road. Rong Jun, spokesman for the Beijing Transport Commission, said the lottery policy is far from perfect, but it's needed under the circumstances, since Beijing's population and demand for cars have surpassed the city's capacity. Beijing aims to keep the total number of cars below 6.3 million until 2020. As of the end of 2017, the city had about 5.9 million cars. In 2011, when the lottery policy was launched, the number was around 4.98 million."
0,"Bard will work with Beijing's Central Conservatory of Music to create the program, said to be the first of its kind at a Western college.  Students will be able to apply in January for a first year that will focus on the erhu, pipa and guzheng, all stringed instruments.  Yu Feng, president of the Beijing school, signed a development initiative for the program and other joint efforts with Robert Martin, director of the New York school, on Sunday in Beijing.  Martin, who is a cellist, said he has been coming to China since the 1970s and had the idea of introducing a Chinese instrument performance degree program at Bard two years ago.  ""The goal is to create a comprehensive and effective platform for Chinese music in the United States,"" he said. ""I believe our partnership is what diplomats call a win-win situation.""  Yu hailed the project as a ""trailblazing step"" for Chinese music worldwide that would create a new channel for cultural exchange between the two countries.  ""Traditional Chinese culture is the basis of Chinese music and Chinese instruments,"" Yu said. ""We will also introduce lessons such as calligraphy, traditional Chinese opera and Chinese poetry to our students.""  In a video played for the announcement ceremony, Leon Botstein, president of Bard, said: ""There has been much development regarding the absorption of the teaching of Western instruments and Western music. This needs to be balanced by the introduction of the great tradition of Chinese music and Chinese instruments to Western musicians, inspiring young musicians of the next generation.""  Bard, a private liberal arts college founded in 1860, launched its music conservatory in 2005. The new program will build on its existing five-year music and liberal arts and science program to combine the professional study of traditional Chinese instruments with a Western-style liberal arts education. According to Yu, three professors from the Beijing school will become primary faculty members.  Outside the program, the initiative will also launch an annual Chinese music festival at Bard and an annual summer school for high school students. Both will focus on music from contemporary China. Seminars and scholarly conferences on Chinese music, art and social development will also be held in the US and China on alternate years.  Chinese conductor Cai Jindong will chair the committee overseeing the initiative. Cai, who was born in Beijing and studied violin and piano, went to the US in 1985 and joined the Stanford University faculty as professor in 2004. He has been guest conductor of major symphony orchestras in both China and the US.  ""I have been working and living in the US for more than 30 years, and to me this program is like a dream come true,"" he said.  He noted that the development of Western music in China has a very long history, starting with Matteo Ricci (1552-1610), the Italian believed to have been the first Jesuit priest to enter Beijing. Ricci gave a clavichord to Emperor Wanli of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) in 1601.  ""Chinese music never really developed in the West,"" Cai said. ""We believe this program will make changes in the long run."""
1,"Chinese e-commerce giants Alibaba and JD.com are set to play a big role in the country's drive to alleviate and eliminate poverty in the coming years. China is pressed for time to lift all people out of poverty by 2020, which is when the central government has pledged to finish building a moderately prosperous society in all respects. Poor rural logistics is a root problem that has led to poverty in areas in Shaanxi and Gansu provinces, according to Liu Qiangdong, president of JD.com. ""A lot of high quality produce from rural areas have no price competitiveness when transported to cities like Beijing and Shanghai because of high logistics costs,"" Liu said while addressing the Internet-driven Poverty-alleviation Forum, at the 4th World Internet Conference underway in Wuzhen, Zhejiang province on Dec 3. In a bid to solve the problem, JD.com has been actively building a logistics network to cover the whole country for the past 10 years. By the year-end, logistics centers run by the company are expected to reach 500, to reach all 600,000 villages in China. JD.com is also dedicated to exploring cutting-edge technology solutions such as automated warehouses and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to cut logistics costs and increase efficiency in rural areas. Liu revealed that JD.com is building two large drone delivery systems in Shaanxi and Sichuan provinces. In Sichuan, a total of 185 drone airports will be established, enabling the transportation of goods from mountainous villages in the province to any part of the country within 24 hours, according to Liu. Alibaba, on the other hand, is also devoting great efforts to purge poverty. Just a few days ago, the company set up a special fund to promote prosperity in China's rural areas. In the next five years, Alibaba will invest 10 billion yuan ($1.5 billion) to explore multiple ways to fight against poverty using internet technologies. Ant Financial Services Group, an affiliate company of Alibaba, has provided unsecured loan services to more than 2 million rural startups, said Jing Xiandong, the company's chief executive officer. In addition to business loans, Ant Financial also offers free online medical insurance for impoverished families to prevent them from being devastated by high medical costs if a family member becomes critically ill. Illness and its related costs are a major cause of poverty among China's rural population. As of the end of 2016, about 40 percent of impoverished people in rural areas suffer from some form of illness, statistics from the National Health and Family Planning Commission show. ""The service allows these families to insure and claim for compensation online,"" Jing said, adding that more than 350,000 rural people have been insured to date. He also mentioned Alibaba's other plans to tackle poverty, including subsidizing college students in poor areas and planting trees where desertification hinders local economic development. JD.com and Alibaba are not only the ones working against poverty, other domestic e-commerce companies such as Vipshop and Yigo have rolled out specific plans to promote the national poverty alleviation campaign, with more expected to join in the future. China lifted 12.4 million rural residents out of poverty last year. There are still 43.3 million people living below the poverty line with an average annual income less than 2,300 yuan ($340), according to the National Bureau of Statistics."
0,"Chongli, about 150 kilometers northwest of Beijing, has become a mecca for China's fast-growing band of skiing enthusiasts in the three years since the capital successfully bid to co-host the 2022 Winter Olympics. Even though 35-year-old Wang Yang, a media worker and enthusiastic skier from Beijing, knows the ski resorts will be crowded at this time of the year, he's maintaining his weekly routine of trips to Chongli, a district in Zhangjiakou, Hebei province. To escape the stress of city life, he drives three and a half hours every weekend from his home in western Beijing's Gongzhufen area to Genting Resort Secret Garden, a ski resort in Chongli. ""I have been enchanted with skiing for seven years,"" Wang said, adding that the thrill of skiing down a snow-covered mountain at high speed always makes him eager to go again. He used to ski closer to home but has opted for Chongli as a regular skiing spot in recent years because it has become a ""big star"" in the skiing world since July 2015, when Beijing won the right to co-host the 2022 Winter Olympics. Chongli will hold 50 Olympic events in six disciplines-snowboarding, freestyle skiing, cross-country skiing, ski jumping, Nordic combined and biathlon-according to the Beijing Organizing Committee for the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games. ""It's a great thrill for a ski-lover like me to play at a host venue for an Olympic Games because all of its infrastructure must be at international level,"" Wang said. Hosting the Winter Olympics has given Chongli great momentum to further develop its winter sports industry. A winter sports destination for two decades, the district now boasts seven resorts for skiing and skating, four of which are listed among the top 10 in China, according to its tourism bureau. The resorts have 169 ski slopes with a total length of 162 kilometers, and can host more than 50,000 skiers a day. In 2017, about 4 million tourists visited Chongli, mainly for skiing, three times as many as in 2012, according to the district's tourism bureau. Thaiwoo Ski Resort, a resort in Chongli with 34 ski slopes covering 800,000 square meters, expects to receive 250,000 visitors during the 2018-19 winter season, which runs from November to April, according to its marketing director, Wu Qiong.,""The number of visitors will be five times greater than during the 2015-16 winter season, the first after Beijing won the bid,"" Wu said. He said the resort will see many more winter tourists in the coming years because a high-speed railway line linking Beijing with Zhangjiakou will be put into operation this year. ""About 90 percent of our visitors are from neighboring places, including Beijing, Tianjin and other cities in Hebei,"" Wu said. The train will cut the travel time from Beijing to Zhangjiakou to about one hour and make tourists' travel much easier, he said. The winter tourism boom in Chongli is emblematic of a widespread phenomenon. Chongli and Beijing's Yanqing district, spurred by preparations for hosting the 2022 Winter Olympics, are just two popular winter tourism destinations attracting growing numbers of tourists. China's northeastern provinces-Heilongjiang and Jilin-have long been the country's traditional hot spots for winter tourism due to their cold, snowy winters, and there are also some emerging destinations for winter tourism, including the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, Inner Mongolia autonomous region, and the provinces of Liaoning, Qinghai and Gansu, according to the China Tourism Academy. Yang Xue, a 29-year-old resident of Baotou, Inner Mongolia, started to ski last year after being intrigued by her friends' social media postings about the sport. ""Many of my friends have been participating in winter sports in recent years and they seemed to be having much fun,"" Yang said, adding that she had skied twice at a new resort in a suburb of Baotou. To promote winter sports, Inner Mongolia plans to build more than 200 skating rinks and 30 ski resorts by 2025, Inner Mongolia Daily reported. The number of winter tourists in China reached 170 million in the 2016-17 season, with revenue from winter tourism reaching 270 billion yuan ($39 billion), according to statistics from the China Tourism Academy. It forecast that winter tourist numbers will rise to 340 million in the 2021-22 season, with revenue of 670 billion yuan. The flourishing winter tourism in China has also attracted overseas enthusiasts. Ted Wood, 56, founder of the International Sports and Media Development Group, grew up skiing in his hometown close to Lake Placid, New York, which hosted the Winter Olympics in 1932 and 1980.,He said winter sports are becoming a bigger part of Chinese leisure activities as the country prepares for the Winter Olympics. ""Winter sports are getting more Chinese out of their homes to do healthy exercise in the cold, escape from the stress of life, and enjoy the fresh air that us skiers love, "" Wood said. Attracted by the rapid development of winter sports in China, Wood plans to spend part of the year in China in the future. He is exploring the establishment of an ""East West winter sports association"", which would focus on winter sports development in China and link those interested in it with the rest of the world. ""Prospects for winter sports in China are very good because many people in the West want to visit China, to ski or skate or to do related business,"" Wood said. However, Chinese people's participation in winter sports is still at a low level, and most people only go skiing or skating occasionally, Li Shuwang, executive director of the Humanistic Olympic Studies Center affiliated with Renmin University of China, said in an interview with Guangming Daily. The number of visitors participating in winter sports only accounted for 27.6 percent of tourists during the 2016-17 winter season, according to the China Tourism Academy, with the rest traveling to see winter scenery or exhibitions. A study by the National Survey Research Center at Renmin University showed that about 62 million Chinese participated in ice and snow sports from 2017 to 2018, around 5 percent of the country's population. ""Insufficient infrastructure is the biggest barrier for the masses to participate in winter sports,"" Wang Weidong, deputy head of the center, told Guangming Daily. He said China has 0.2 ski resorts per million people, compared with 31.75 in Austria, 24.25 in Switzerland, and 8.23 in Canada. Convenient and economical ski resorts are needed to popularize ice and snow sports, Wang Weidong said. China launched ice and snow sports development plans in 2016 that aim to see the value of the industry reach 600 billion yuan by 2020. The country also aims to have 650 skating rinks by 2022, up from 200 in 2015, and 800 ski resorts, up from 500."
1,"A symposium on cross-Straits relations and national rejuvenation was held on Monday morning in Beijing. About 100 people from across the Taiwan Straits attended the meeting, including Liu Jieyi, head of the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office and Hung Hsiu-chu, former chairwoman of the Kuomintang party. The symposium was co-organized by the Center for the Study of Cross-Straits Relations in the mainland and the Chinese Cyan Geese Peace Education Foundation in Taiwan. The participants reached a positive consensus and put forward joint initiatives through dialogue and consultation, the mainland's Taiwan Affairs Office said in a statement on Monday. Both sides should join hands to achieve national rejuvenation, and in the process of national rejuvenation Taiwan compatriots should not and will not be absent, the statement read. The two sides agreed adhering to the 1992 Consensus, the one-China principle and opposing ""Taiwan independence"" are the political foundation for the peaceful development of cross-Straits relations, it said. They called on people from both sides to cherish and consolidate this foundation, strengthen exchanges and consultation and jointly safeguard overall peace and stability. According to the statement, the mainland will continue to share development opportunities with Taiwan compatriots and actively institutionalize cross-Straits economic cooperation so as to increase people's sense of gain, honor and happiness. Cultural exchanges and the communications between young people on both sides will continue to be strengthened. Hung Hsiu-chu, the former chair of the KMT, led a delegation from various circles in Taiwan to visit Beijing from Sunday to Wednesday."
1,"Two Sino-US direct flights will stop in October, hampered by rising fuel costs, fierce competition, and slowing travel demand due to trade friction between China and the United States, industry experts said. On Tuesday, Dallas-based American Airlines said it would stop flying the route between Chicago and Shanghai, after cutting direct flights between Chicago and Beijing in May, citing higher fuel costs and a ""competitive environment"". ""Our Chicago-Shanghai service is unprofitable and simply not sustainable in this high fuel cost environment, when we have opportunities to be successful in other markets,"" said Vasu Raja, vice-president of network and schedule planning of American Airlines. The largest US carrier by passengers said in a statement that it would seek a US Department of Transportation waiver to allow a return to the market once conditions improve. The airline also said it hoped to find new ways of cooperation once the new Beijing airport in Daxing district starts operations by next year. Besides, it is launching nine new routes, and these are mainly direct flights between the US and Europe. Meanwhile, Hawaiian Airlines, which operates direct flights between Beijing and Honolulu three times a week, announced on Wednesday that it would close the service after the weeklong National Day holiday in October. This is the only Sino-US direct flight currently operated by Hawaiian Airlines, and it said in the statement that those who have booked flights after October could get full refunds. ""The fuel costs have surged. In July, fuel costs jumped about 40 percent compared with the same time last year, and the cost pressure of intercontinental flights is significant,"" said Lin Zhijie, an aviation industry analyst and columnist at Carnoc, one of China's largest civil aviation websites. ""The flights between major Chinese cities and the US are quite saturated. US carriers are at certain disadvantages, as the majority of demand increment comes from outbound Chinese travelers. Most Chinese passengers tend to buy flight tickets from Chinese airlines, and US carriers don't benefit much from that, they may adjust their strategies to other routes,"" he said. He added that the ongoing trade tensions between the world's largest two economies may affect business travel. In addition, business and tourism visa approvals have become tighter, therefore travel demand growth is likely to slow down. Still, United Airlines and Hainan Airlines operate direct flights between Chicago and Beijing. United Airlines, Delta Airlines and China Eastern Airlines offer direct flights between Chicago and Shanghai. American Airlines continues to operate flights between China and Los Angeles and Dallas. In addition, United Airlines canceled its direct flights between Hangzhou and San Francisco last year, only one year after it launched the service, as the nearby airports in Shanghai took away some customers."
0,"A proposed plan that aims to allow the children of renters better access to schools in their neighborhood was rolled out in Beijing, reported Xinhua News Agency on Wednesday. According to the proposed plan released by Beijing Education Commission on Wednesday, a school-age child who is a permanent resident of the city and lives in a rented home can enroll at a primary school nearby. The plan is designed to give young people who don't have their own housemore options for their children's education, said Feng Hongrong, an official from the city education commission. The rule targets children from a family who lives in one district and has the family members' or permanent residence, registered in another one. To be eligible for the proposed policy, one of the parents should have worked for over three years in the district where they rent a home. The plan also proposes strict regulations against recruiting students for primary and secondary schools based on participating in after-school education organizations as well as a ban on schools organizing tests for enrolling students. China's Law on Compulsory Education states that governments should offer adolescents of school age access to education in schools where their permanent residence is registered."
0,"The world premiere of an English-language musical version of   will be staged in Beijing from Nov 30 to Dec 9. Then it will tour Xi'an, Shaanxi province, from Dec 15 to Dec 22 and Shanghai from Dec 29 to Jan 13. Based on the original French version of the musical, entitled Autant emporte le Vent, in which both lyrics and music were written by the French musical writer Gerard Presgurvic and which premiered in Paris in 2003, the new musical version of Gone With the Wind is a collaboration between the composer, Presgurvic, and the Beijing-based company, Joyway. The company brought Presgurvic's musical, Romeo and Juliet, to China in 2016. According to Zhang Ligang, founder and president of Joyway, the project of adapting the French musical into English started more than two years ago. Zhang and his wife, Qiao Jing, a former host on China Central Television (CCTV), who is the producer of the English version of the musical, flew to Seoul in 2015 to meet Presgurvic, when the musical's Korean edition was staged. Set against the backdrop of the American Civil War in the 1860s, the musical follows the life changes of the main characters, Scarlett O'Hara and her lover Rhett Butler.,""Like Romeo and Juliet, Gone With the Wind is a clas-sic story, which we still enjoy today. When I wrote the musical, I used music to portray the role of Scarlett O'Hara, who has grown up quite privileged but all the trappings of her luxurious lifestyle are destroyed because of the war. The story is her personal transition from a self-centered and spoiled young girl into a mature and independent woman,"" says Presgurvic, who wrote 28 songs for the musical, blending various musical styles, such as rock, pop and jazz. ""It was much more challenging to make an English version of Gone With the Wind than to bring the original French version. When we initiated the idea of making the English version of the musical, Presgurvic liked it and we did a global casting together,"" says Zhang, noting that the original novel by American author Margret Mitchell in 1936 and the 1939 Hollywood movie starring Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable have both enjoyed great popularity in China. Gone With the Wind is the only novel by Mitchell that was published during her lifetime. Mitchell received the Pulitzer Prize for fiction for the book in 1937. New York-based actress Rachel Gold, who has been seen in The Phantom of the Opera on Broadway playing Christine Daae, will play the role of Scarlett O'Hara, opposite actor, American singer-songwriter, Eric Briarley, as Rhett Butler. ""I've read the book and watched the movie several times to understand the role. Vivien Leigh is very inspiring and I will add my own interpretation into the role,"" Gold says in Beijing. American singer-songwriter, Amy Vachal, who is a semifinalist on the ninth season of popular American TV singing competition, The Voice, plays the role of Melanie Wilkes. Gone With the Wind will mark her debut as a musical actress. French singer-songwriter Cyril Niccolai, who played Ashley Wilkes in the French version of the musical will play the same role in the English version. Frantz Morel, who worked with Presgurvic on the French musical version of Romeo and Juliet will direct the new play. He notes that, of all the 500 costumes created for the musical, Scarlett O'Hara's nine dresses highlight the protagonist's life. The musical will also feature eight styles of dance, including ballet, contemporary dance and waltzes that will be performed by over 30 dancers from around the world. chennan@chinadaily.com.cn  (China Daily 11/19/2018 page20)"
1,"Birthday celebrations often involve a cake and candles, but for Tian Jimo, her entry into adulthood was marked by something a little different – a lifetime supply of beer by Harbin Beer. Born in Beijing on Dec 31, 2000, at 11:59 pm, Tian was considered the last person in China to turn 18 in 2018. Tian and her twin sister, Jichu, who was born just minutes after in 2001, had previously made the news for being the first pair of twins born across two millennia. Tian's family members on Dec 31 lured her to a surprise party in Beijing planned by Harbin Beer. There, she was gifted her personal beer tap which could only be activated through facial recognition. ""From today, everyone born in the 20th century will be considered adults,"" said Vicky Ma, the marketing director of Harbin Beer. ""Reaching the legal drinking age is considered a rite of passage for young people. ""We put ourselves in the shoes of those born at the end of the year and imagined how miserable it would be to watch most of your peers enjoy the official status of being legally allowed to drink. So we thought we'd make it up to the last person to turn 18 and give her a very special birthday gift."" Tian said she was left speechless by her personal beer tap and the efforts that multinational drink and brewing holdings company AB InBev – it is the owner of Harbin Beer – took to throw her the party. ""I'm very honored that AB InBev has specially organized this epic birthday party for me. I really appreciate the generosity that came from Harbin Beer. At the same time, it is my privilege to know that I was the special person Harbin Beer was searching for as I mark my journey towards adulthood. Lastly, I would like to thank everyone who was involved in planning this party for me. I wish everyone a happy New Year,"" she said."
0,"Swire Properties is working closely with the annual Beijing Music Festival, supporting and sponsoring high-quality cultural performances in its venues around the capital city. Due to the close collaboration between BMF and Swire Properties, more and more classical music, high-art performances and creative works have come to Beijing. All these have made Swire Properties' Taikoo Li Sanlitun a genuine Beijing cultural landmark, and have allowed the public to experience creative arts and music. A Chinese saying goes, while it is easy to relieve one's frustrations by turning to music, it is extremely challenging to find a bosom friend to share that music with. However, BMF is lucky to have many companions to share in its common visions and values, and Swire Properties is one of its most outstanding companions. BMF and Swire Properties first began working together in 2010. A key early performance the two have hosted is renowned pianist Li Yundi's master class in The Orange venue at Sanlitun Village, which was renamed as Taikoo Li Sanlitun in 2013. Li played his favorite pieces by composer Chopin, offered a critique to piano students from various musical institutions and answered questions about his music career and performances. The master class was broadcast directly outside The Orange via an LED screen, allowing many more passersby to witness the masterful performance.,  According to Swire Properties, BMF commits itself to bringing high-quality music and art experiences to all audiences, which perfectly matches its commitment to building communities. With its long-standing commitment to building communities, Swire Properties transforms neighborhoods and connects them to the latest developments in art, shopping, music and culture. By collaborating with BMF, the fashion landmark of Beijing Taikoo Li Sanlitun has also gained a more profound cultural appeal. Yu Long, the artistic director of BMF, said: ""We share the same vision with Swire Properties in building and enriching the cultural life in Beijing's communities. ""By presenting BMF performances as well as major community and educational outreach events in Taikoo Li Sanlitun, we make music and contemporary lifestyle interact, while BMF becomes closer to the heart of Beijing's cultural life."" Yu said Sanlitun's fashionable and energetic atmosphere endorses BMF. He said he hoped that the cooperation would strengthen in the future and that Swire Properties can play a more important role in connecting art and life in the city. BMF will help more and more music lovers to enjoy international concerts in China, according to Yu.,Having achieved great success from their very first collaboration, BMF and Swire Properties have proactively strengthened their long-term cooperation in many different art fields. Since 2010, BMF has organized numerous cultural activities and performances at Taikoo Li Sanlitun, covering diverse genres. In 2011, BMF launched its Urban Series music program in collaboration with Swire Properties. By introducing contemporary and dynamic performances, the series has attracted new, young audiences to the renowned festival, and promoted arts and culture as essential elements of an urban lifestyle. With the successful hosting of many performances, the Urban Series has brought increasingly fresh experiences for audiences, including Ju Percussion Group's concert; a musical conversation program hosted by renowned singers Cui Jian and Luo Dayou, and conductors Tan Dun and Yu Long; the Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain's Also Sprach Zarathustra, an adapted version from Richard Strauss' symphonic masterpiece. Since last year, mini operas have also been performed on stage at Taikoo Li Sanlitun. After making a great sensation with Don Giovanni in 2016, Silent Opera comes back this year to debut Czech composer Leos Janacek's The Cunning Little Vixen, which has won unanimous praise. Muziektheater Transparant presented La Voix Humaine, a one-act opera by French contemporary composer Francis Poulenc, treating the audience to a midnight in Paris experience as they enjoyed the touching story.,Differing from other sponsors, Swire Properties is also BMF's venue partner. In 2012, for the first time, BMF presented a large number of its concerts in a creative new venue－The Orange in Taikoo Li Sanlitun. On Aug 3, 2015 when the 18th BMF convened its news conference, The Red venue, in Taikoo Li Sanlitun North was officially unveiled. By making the young, fashionable Taikoo Li Sanlitun its home, high art has naturally spread widely and deeply, becoming a part of people's daily life. The move reflects what Liu Suola, a renowned musician and composer, said, that art should not be treated like antiques kept in museums, but should be modern and charming, and should blend right in with the fast-paced urban lifestyle. BMF has begun to work alongside INDIGO, Swire Properties' second development near Beijing's 798 art district. The two parties have created a public benefit ""family weekend"", which allows more local families to come into contact with high art."
0,"China has sent air and marine surveillance forces to monitor the oil leak caused by the sunken oil tanker Sanchi and will continue to work with other nations in handling this matter, said a Foreign Ministry spokesman. The nation has also spared no effort in the search and rescue of crew members from the ship and will cooperate with Iran to investigate the accident, Lu Kang told a news conference in Beijing on Tuesday. The spokesman refuted allegations that ""China did not use adequate measures to search for and rescue crew members"", saying the Iranian side has fully recognized China's efforts. In addition to its own vessels, China invited ships from South Korea and Japan to take part in the search-and-rescue operations. Currently, 13 vessels are working together at the scene, he said. The Panama-registered Sanchi, which was owned by an Iranian company and carried 136,000 metric tons of highly flammable condensate oil, or natural gas liquids, collided with a Hong Kong freighter, CR Crystal, on Jan 6 some 160 nautical miles east of Shanghai and burst into flames. On Sunday, the ship exploded and sank. A large amount of the spilled condensate continued to burn on the sea's surface until Monday morning, the State Oceanic Administration said. Chinese experts have said that if the leak is not adequately dealt with, it will jeopardize the ecosystem of the surrounding waters, and that the most urgent task is to retrieve the leaked oil. Peng Yingdeng, a researcher at the National Research Center on Urban Environmental Pollution Control in Beijing, told Red Star News, a mobile phone-based portal in Sichuan province's Chengdu, that the accident seems to have had little effect on the air quality of coastal cities but is likely to extensively disturb the structure and functions of seawater around the scene. Huang Weiqiu, a professor at Changzhou University's School of Petroleum Engineering, explained to the same portal that the leaked condensate oil will take a long time to evaporate due to the chilly temperature of the sea, so it is likely to remain afloat and keep moving along with sea waves, posing a serious threat to marine organisms. Science and Technology Daily quoted Professor Gong Yongjun, a marine salvage expert at Dalian Maritime University in Liaoning province as saying that China is technically capable of recovering most of the oil that has sunken with the vessel using divers and robots."
0,"China’s Cultural and Tourism Minister Luo Shugang met with María Julia Mu?oz, minister of Culture and Education of Uruguay, in Beijing on Monday. Luo expressed a warm welcome to Mu?oz. He pointed out that China and Uruguay established a strategic partnership in 2016 when Uruguayan President Tabarez Vazquez visited Beijing. Looking back, the China-Uruguay relationship has been one of the most active in China-Latin American and Caribbean relations. 2016 was the China-Uruguay Cultural Exchange Year, and both countries celebrated 30 years of bilateral diplomatic ties with a series of cultural events. Uruguay also was one the first Latin-American countries to support the Belt and Road Initiative. Luo said that China is willing to enhance cultural cooperation with Uruguay under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative. That includes expanding cultural and art communication platforms, improving people-to-people exchange, deepening cooperation between art agencies, and reinforcing marketing on travel resources to build a solid, humane foundation for bilateral strategic friendship and cooperation. Mu?oz agreed with Luo and spoke highly of efforts made by the Ministry of Culture of China for cultural exchanges on both sides, and said that Uruguay is willing to continue its various bilateral visits and communication with China for cultural agencies, enterprises and artists in both countries.  She also expressed support for the establishment of a China Cultural Center in Uruguay, promoting bilateral cooperation to a new level. After the meeting, Luo and Mu?oz signed a memorandum of understanding between the government of the People's Republic of China and the government of the Eastern Republic of Uruguay for the establishment of a China Cultural Center in Uruguay."
1,"China has received information that US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is considering a trip to Beijing to hold talks on the ongoing trade dispute, the Ministry of Commerce said in a brief statement on Sunday. The statement quoted a ministry spokesperson saying China welcomes this development. Experts said that although the move may seem positive, China must prepare for countermeasures if both sides fail to reach consensus because policies made by the Trump administration lack consistency. Mnuchin said at a news conference at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank spring meetings in Washington on Saturday that he wanted to meet with his Chinese counterparts to try to resolve the trade differences, and said he may travel to China. As the midterm congressional elections approach in the United States, the Trump administration needs something eye-catching to regain support before the vote and to please giant companies like Boeing and General Motors and agricultural concerns like the American Soybean Association, said Tu Xinquan, director of the China Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. Under such circumstances, Tu said, Mnuchin’s possible visit to Beijing can be seen as a gesture, whether successful or not, the Trump administration has to take action to prevent rising prices of consumer goods and revenue losses by a large number of US companies dependent on trade with China. “Soon after Trump announced the latest tariff proposal, many US officials and economists mentioned the possibility of negotiations. They were trying to pacify the markets and prevent US stock prices from falling further,” said Mei Xinyu, a senior research fellow of the Commerce Ministry’s Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation. Mei said China can conduct negotiations with the US under World Trade Organization rules, and on the other hand prepare measures to firmly fight back the unilateral and unfair trade moves if both sides failed to reach deals via talks. “China’s move can follow the principle of a precision strike. It must take measures to deal a blow to the industries in many US states that helped Trump win the 2016 presidential election and those states whose political leaders are still backing him in this year’s midterm elections,” he said. “The trade dispute is not between China and the US people, but between China and Trump’s protectionist-minded administration.” The International Monetary Fund warned on Thursday that trade tensions between the US and China and some other countries could erode the confidence that is vital for global growth. Because the world is so interconnected, the supply chains involve so many countries that it would affect the global economy, the IMF has said."

1,"BEIJING -- President Xi Jinping met with New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern in Beijing Monday. They agreed to continuously enrich the China-New Zealand comprehensive strategic partnership based on the principles of mutual trust and mutual benefit. During their meeting at the Great Hall of the People, Xi first expressed sincere condolences to New Zealand for the deadly shootings in Christchurch two weeks ago, saying that Ardern's visit to China at a moment that her country was facing a special important agenda showed the great importance she and the New Zealand government attached to bilateral ties. China has always viewed New Zealand as a sincere friend and partner, Xi said, adding that China-New Zealand ties, established 47 years ago, had always been at the forefront among relationships between China and Western countries. He called on both countries to continue to deepen the bilateral comprehensive strategic partnership based on the principles of mutual trust and mutual benefit. China stands ready to work with New Zealand to maintain the bilateral ties as a ""front-runner"" in relations between China and Western countries, Xi said. Under the new circumstances, the two countries need to further deepen mutual understanding and trust and respect each other's core interests and major concerns in the spirit of openness, inclusiveness and seeking common grounds while reserving differences, he said. Xi called on both sides to expand substantial cooperation. China will support capable enterprises to invest in New Zealand, while New Zealand needs to provide a fair, just and unbiased business environment for Chinese enterprises, he said. He also called for the speeding up of negotiations on the upgrade of the bilateral free trade agreement. China welcomes New Zealand to participate in the Belt and Road construction, Xi said, encouraging both countries to enhance cooperation in international affairs, jointly strive for an open world economy and uphold multilateralism and multilateral trading. China attaches importance to climate change and is willing to work with New Zealand to promote the sustainable development of Pacific island countries, the president said. He also encouraged both countries to enhance exchanges in areas including education, culture, youth and science and technology, and to host a successful China-New Zealand Year of Tourism in 2019. Ardern thanked Xi for extending condolences over the deadly shooting incident, and expressed condolences for the loss of life in a chemical plant blast in Jiangsu Province in late March. Noting the long history of friendship between New Zealand and China, Ardern said her country attached great importance to ties with China and was proud that the country led in many areas in developing ties with China. Ardern said she agreed with Xi's comments on the relations between the two countries, and looked forward to strengthening the New Zealand-China comprehensive strategic partnership and deepening bilateral economic and trade cooperation and people-to-people exchanges after this visit. She reiterated New Zealand's adherence to the one-China policy. New Zealand pursues an independent foreign policy and firmly supports multilateralism and free trade, Ardern said, adding that the country had long supported the Belt and Road Initiative and participated in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. She said New Zealand would send a high-level delegation to the second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation to be held later this month in Beijing. New Zealand is ready to enhance cooperation and coordination with China on major international issues including climate change, the prime minister said. Ardern arrived in Beijing on Sunday for a two-day visit to China. This is her first official visit to China since becoming New Zealand's prime minister in October 2017."

0,"Scholars look at how the country's relations with foreign cultures have evolved over the past four decades. A group of scholars recently discussed the cultural exchanges that have taken place in Beijing over the past 40 years' reform and opening-up. The scholars of social sciences and the humanities were participating in the academic dialogue Retrospect, Connection and Innovation, held at the Beijing Foreign Studies University. Beijing replaced Xi'an, once the capital of imperial China in Shaanxi province, to be the cultural center of China during the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368), according to Ouyang Zhesheng, a history professor at Peking University. And since then Beijing has become an international metropolis, Ouyang says. ""Over the past 40 years, we have been driven by a need to introduce the essence of Western culture, hoping to go global,"" Ouyang says. ""But now China and the West have moved to a new stage marked by dialogues and run-ins."" American sinologist Roger T. Ames, an expert on Chinese philosophy, sees changes in Chinese culture now that China has gone through changes in its politics and its economy. In Ames' view, the core of Chinese philosophy lies in humanity and a growing number of the younger generation in China are seeking their future in traditional cultural connotations. ""Confucianism cannot resolve all the challenges we are facing. However, it should have its place and voice,"" says Ames, who will be giving lectures on Taoism at the Free University of Berlin for a month from mid-January. Ames sees value in the mutually beneficial thinking rooted in traditional Chinese culture, which in the words of his former graduate student, Tian Chenshan, currently the director of the center for East-West relations at BFSU, is undervalued in individualistic ideology. Chinese culture takes human relations, rather than ""self"", as the priority, says Tian. ""We should keep our own culture in mind in the first place, and then cultivate cultural composure and be critical in order to better learn from other cultures,"" Tian says.,Applying Ames' comparative philosophy method, he thinks that people should look at the cultural roots of each other when trying to understand another culture as well as frequent frictions. Yang Xusheng, the director of the Center for World Religious and Global Ethics at Peking University, says Emperor Kangxi (1662-1722) was an iconic figure in the eyes of the French enlightenment thinkers during the 18th century, though there was a cultural misreading. Yang, in the 1990s, studied with Hans Kung, or Kong Hansi in Chinese, a Swiss philosopher and theologian, who is focused on diverse religious traditions and seeking a consent that can be considered as a basic value for human beings today and in the future. According to Yang, Kung found the appropriate expression of the value in Confucianism. And Yang says spiritual and cultural exchanges are essential in the future and require open dialogue and mutual learning. Michele Ferrero, an Italian Latinist at BFSU, not only teaches Latin, but also takes his students to some churches in Beijing to help them gain a more comprehensive picture of Latin culture. Every summer, he also takes students to visit Rome.,Though not many people learn and use Latin these days, a number of Chinese students realize it is the key to Western history, science, philosophy and religious studies. ""The Chinese value history,"" says Ferrero. However, he recognizes the cultural differences between Italy and China and stresses it's difficult to define an ""Italian culture"". So, be careful, but relax and be tolerant, says Ferrero. David Bartosch, German philosopher and a professor at the School of International Relations and Diplomacy at BFSU, has for years been observing politics and diplomacy, especially China's relationship with Europe, using a philosophical perspective. He sees the Belt and Road Initiative as an inevitable result of the development of Eurasian civilizations and says that in turn Beijing should and will be more international with the progress of BRI. Bartosch calls for detailed and deeper thinking of further policies of reform and opening-up. And he says he hopes that German thinkers will participate. Zhang Xiping, the director of the BFSU Academy of Comparative Civilizations and Intercultural Communication, says the presence of sinologists like Ames shows that Chinese culture is global and that more academic discussions are needed to promote research on it. Since 2008, Zhang has devoted himself to studying and publishing documents on East-West cultural exchanges in the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties that are housed at the Vatican Library and were mainly written by missionaries of the time. Zhang says he recently got to know that there is a large number of documents on China in Lyon, France, and wants more support to collect and study them."
0,"As a child, jazz pianist Luo Ning enjoyed lying under a big tree and seeing the rays of sunlight shine through the canopy of leaves after he was done with hours of piano practice. Little did he know that this scene would become his inspiration for his original piece When Light & Shadow Meet, which is also the name of his latest album. ""When I learned classical music, I liked poetic pieces by Debussy and Maurice Ravel. Their pieces are full of colors, just like Impressionist paintings,"" says the Urumqi-born pianist. The album, which was released on July 6, features nine pieces that combines Luo's original materials with classic jazz songs. This is his first album after signing with jazz record label GRP Records, a company under Universal Music Group. Recorded in Los Angeles, the new album features a collaboration with US jazz fusion drummer Dave Weckl, bassist Tom Kennedy and trumpeter Wallace Roney, as well as Chinese jazz musicians, including drummer Lu Xun and saxophonist Wu Letian. ""We had quite a tight schedule, recording five songs in a day, because all the musicians are busy and they had to fly from different parts of the world to Los Angeles,"" says Luo. ""The music we performed in the studio is just like the sunshine of Los Angeles, clear, warm and colorful."" Weckl has been to China a few times but this was his first collaboration with a Chinese musician. ""I am really glad to see how Chinese music and Chinese drummers are improving so quickly,"" says Weckl, who introduced his long-time friend bass player Kennedy and saxophonist Brandon Fields to Luo.,""We had a splendid time working together. Luo played all the piano and electric piano tracks. He's been to Cuba to learn music before so he knows how to perform in the language of Latin music."" Luo, who started learning classical piano at 4, studied at Xinjiang Arts University before arriving in Beijing in 1996 to pursue his jazz dreams. In 2010, he furthered his musical education at the University of Arts of Cuba where he studied with Cuban pianist Chucho Valdes. The eight-time Grammy Award winner, now 75, immediately opened Luo's eyes to the jazz genre, Afro-Cuban music and Latin American rhythms. Luo and Weckl worked together to compose a song titled Life Philosophies for this latest album. The song was based on an earlier piece that Luo wrote. ""Many of my compositions come from my intuition. During my childhood, I liked improvising while playing classical piano pieces. It's about capturing feelings at a particular moment,"" says Luo, who wrote For Us and Everyday Is A New Day for the album. He also performed Stella By Starlight, arguably one of the most popular jazz standards of all time, You're My Everything, a 1931 song composed by Harry Warren, and Blue in Green, composed by trumpeter Miles Davis and pianist Bill Evans. ""When I first heard his music, I thought these works were so special. The musicality was so subtle, and it had different cultures clashing into each other,"" says bass player Kennedy of Luo's album. Luo says that his music is influenced by his hometown of Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region - many of his works feature ethnic music elements. He also likes to fuse jazz with music from Xinjiang, including the pieces The Beautiful Kashgar, Xinjiang Xinjiang and The Heart of Sayram Lake. He has also experimented combining jazz with other types of Chinese music. One of his earlier works is Farewell My Concubine, which was inspired by the famous Peking Opera piece of the same name performed by late master Mei Lanfang (1894-1961). Luo wrote his rendition in 2011 after visiting Mei Baojiu, son of Mei Lanfang, who is also a Peking Opera master. When Luo first came to Beijing in the 1990s, he met renowned jazz musician Liu Yuan, who is considered one of the pioneers of jazz music in the country. Liu, a Beijing native who started out as a folk musician in his early 20s, first learned saxophone in the 1980s when there were only five or six professional jazz musicians in Beijing. Liu often jammed with other musicians at East Shore Live Jazz Cafe, a famous jazz bar located nearby Beijing's Houhai Lake. On July 22, Luo will perform at a jazz festival in Marseille, France, at the invitation of Huang Yong, the president of the China Jazz Association."
0,"Huang Runqiu, vice-minister of environmental protection, has called for a sober assessment of the recent improvement in air quality and continuous efforts to fight pollution. The structure of industry, energy consumption and transportation should be further optimized to reduce the discharge of pollutants, he told a news conference on Saturday. The annual average concentration of PM2.5 - harmful particulate matter with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers that can enter the bloodstream via the lungs - in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region has fallen by about 40 percent in the past five years and Beijing’s PM 2.5 concentration has declined to 58 micrograms per cubic meter last year. The number of days with heavy air pollution in key cities in the country has been halved, according to Huang. He said recent analysis has found that about 30 percent of the improvement was because of favorable meteorological conditions for the dispersal of pollutant, and the rest was due to efforts made by various parties. Though the efforts have generated good results, air pollution has not been completely controlled yet. The air quality of about 70 percent of the country’s 338 major cities has not yet met standard, he said. “We should be cool-headed…and must not relax in our efforts,” said Huang, adding that pollution discharge remains high in the country. Because of the high pollutant discharge, the country is still prone to be troubled by smog in case of unfavorable meteorological conditions, he said. Huang said recent research and analysis have found that the 28 major cities in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei cluster discharge 10 percent of total emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds, as well as 15 percent of nitric oxide and primary particulates, though they cover no more than 3 percent of the country's territory. The government is drafting a new three-year operation dubbed a ""blue sky protection campaign"" to transform the structures of industry, energy consumption and transportation, Huang said. While reducing the coal consumption, which is a major contributor to air pollution in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region especially during the winter heating season, the government will also make efforts to make railway play a bigger role in transportation in the region while decreasing the use of heavy trucks."
0,"Zhang, who is pursuing a master's degree at the University of International Business and Economics, started working on Thursday as a volunteer for the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in Beijing on Sunday and Monday. Wearing a black suit with such Chinese elements as a traditional Zhongshan collar and red buttons on the suit sleeves and on the white shirt inside, the 23-year-old, standing in the lobby of Beijing International Hotel, wears a constant smile and is ever ready to offer help. Zhang, who is responsible for answering inquiries from guests, is one of about 2,500 volunteers who will provide services to delegates from home and abroad. They are all students from 28 universities in the capital, including UIBE, Peking University, Tsinghua University and Beijing Normal University. In February, the Beijing Committee of the Communist Youth League issued a notice to recruit volunteers from among the city's college students. Among the conditions were that applicants must be juniors or above who will be dedicated to working for the forum, and they must be proficient in a foreign language and have previous volunteer experience. Some universities raised the threshold. UIBE, for example, required that candidates must have passed the College English Test Band 6, a senior-level English test for non-English majors. All the selected volunteers went through several rounds of training, including lectures about the forum and Belt and Road Initiative countries, as well as instruction on etiquette and first-aid skills. Jiang Qingzhe, Party chief of UIBE, from which 99 volunteers were chosen, said he's very proud of the young students. ""They are representatives of excellent young Chinese and prospering China,"" he said. To become quickly acquainted with their work, the volunteers created scenarios such as airport pickups, conference registration and route guidance to practice how to serve guests from abroad. Teng Hewen, a volunteer who is studying diplomacy and pursuing a master's degree at UIBE, said she was impressed by details of the training that emphasized paying special attention to guests, for example by always smiling, walking to the left of the guests to show respect, and extending a hand above a car door as guests exit a vehicle to make sure they don't hit their head. ""Through such voluntary work, I hope I can make a small contribution to China's diplomacy,"" she said. Xu Jinxi, a volunteer from Beijing Normal University, worked for five hours nonstop on Friday. ""It's tiring but worthwhile,"" said Xu, who is responsible for delivering documents and materials. ""The delivery is fundamental and crucial, since it affects every single event of the forum, which makes me feel my work is meaningful."""
0,"The First Belt and Road Afro-Sino Art Exchange Exhibition and Afro-Sino Cultural Forum, organized by the Ministry of Sports, Culture and Heritage of the Republic of Kenya, opened in Beijing recently. The event is the first cultural-exchange activity related to the theme of the Belt and Road to be held by a foreign country in China. The opening ceremony was attended by representatives from cultural and art organizations, government departments and embassies of several African countries. ""This art-exchange exhibition is a positive response of the Kenyan government to the Belt and Road Initiative, as well as an exchange opportunity between the cultural and art circles of China and Africa, providing a rare chance for the Chinese people to have a better understanding of African countries through culture and artwork,"" says Rao Quan, director of the National Library, where the event is being held. Rao adds that the library wants to have more in-depth resource sharing, exchanges and cooperation with African countries. Ivan Kiprop Lagat, a cultural councilor from the organizing Kenyan ministry, spoke at the ceremony on behalf of its minister, Rashid Mohamed, saying that culture can serve as a bridge to deepen mutual understanding and trust among countries. He stressed that Kenya has benefited greatly from the Belt and Road Initiative, citing the example of the railway linking Mombasa to Nairobi. He also said he hopes that, as a result of this exhibition, more Chinese people will visit Kenya to experience and feel the passion of African people. The exhibition, entitled Walking into Kenya and Perceive the New Africa, hosted more than 110 artworks, nearly half of which were created by 40 artists from African countries, including Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, Zimbabwe and Tanzania. The exhibited pieces include work that reflects African people's daily lives and folk customs, and is produced using various media, including chalk paintings, sculptures, and contemporary-art installations. With rich themes and diversified forms, the artworks reflect the current situation and characteristics of contemporary African art. The exhibition shows three pieces by Gerard Motondi, a 52-year-old Kenyan sculptor, whose work usually draws inspiration from such themes as fair play and friendship in sports. Motondi explains that his work is crafted from Kisii stone, a very special stone found only in Kisii county in western Kenya that has become part of the local intangible cultural heritage. ""I brought this heritage forward to China to show people here what is found in Africa,"" Motondi says. Though the three pieces exhibited in the library are small, Motondi usually works on huge monumental pieces. He has visited China many times and has been invited to create landmark sculptures for several Chinese cities, such as Shenzhen and Changsha. One of his pieces, which won the gold medal during the Beijing Olympics Fine Art Exhibition in 2008, is part of the collection of a Beijing-based museum dedicated to the Olympics. Motondi believes the ongoing exhibition can further boost exchanges of culture and art between China and Africa. ""The exhibition is something that brings together the artists in both countries and helps us understand our respective cultural heritage,"" he said. More than 40 artworks by more than 30 Chinese artists are also on display. They include oil paintings, traditional Chinese paintings, prints and sculptures reflecting the achievements of the Belt and Road Initiative, cooperation between China and Kenya, and African customs. The exhibition will run through Oct 31."
0,"A transportation plan showing how the Xiongan New Area will link with Beijing, Tianjin and other areas in Hebei province has been unveiled. The map shows that four north-south high-speed railway lines and two east-west routes will pass through Xiongan, according to a report by China Central Television. Routes include existing lines, such as the Beijing-Guangzhou high-speed railway, and new ones, including the Beijing-Xiongan intercity rail. Upon completion of the railways, journeys from Xiongan to Beijing will be reduced to 30 minutes, less than half the current travel time. Trains from Xiongan will only take 20 minutes to reach Beijing's new airport, 30 minutes to reach Tianjin, and an hour to reach Hebei's provincial capital Shijiazhuang, according to the report. Located about 100 kilometers southwest of downtown Beijing, Xiongan sits at the center of the triangular area formed by the capital, Tianjin and Shijiazhuang. It was created to advance the integrated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. Besides railways, the network map also includes seven expressways that will connect the new area to regions near and far. After taking shape, it will take only 60 minutes to drive from Xiongan to Beijing or Tianjin, and 90 minutes to drive to Shijiazhuang. The driving time now is at least two hours to each city. The transportation plan was unveiled in Beijing on Tuesday at a conference on the integrated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region presided over by Vice-Premier Zhang Gaoli. Xinhua News Agency reported that, during the meeting, Zhang said a framework plan for Xiongan has entered a final stage and will be examined and approved by the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council. The two authorities announced the decision to set up Xiongan in April as part of efforts to relocate noncapital functions from Beijing. ""After the plan is approved, the area should implement it prudently and deliberately,"" Zhang said, adding that the construction of transportation infrastructure and ecological environment projects should also be accelerated. He said that more domestic and foreign talent should be invited to participate in the construction of Xiongan, while supporting policies for developing investment and financing, and tax and land development should be formulated. Spanning three counties in Hebei's Baoding, the new area will initially cover about 100 square kilometers before being expanded to about 2,000 sq km over the long-term. A series of preparatory measures have been taken in the area since April, and a group of high-tech giants, including Alibaba and Baidu, have already established branches there."
0,"The Palace Museum Director Shan Jixiang delivered a cultural heritage speech Feb 27 in Beijing, which was co-organized by the Beijing Diplomatic Service Bureau and Beijing Housing Service Corporation for Diplomatic Missions. A total of 600 people from all walks of life, including over 100 foreign guests, participated in the activity. On the theme The World of the Palace Museum and the Palace Museum of the World, the 64-year-old director shared his ideas about how to make traditional treasures come alive again. During the speech, which lasted two and a half hours, Shan touched on topics including upgrading museum infrastructure, restoring cultural relics, digitalizing online museums, setting up restoration hospitals, providing better visitor experiences and promoting the Palace Museum's cultural items. “The abundant collection of cultural relics at the Palace Museum is the inspiration for the creative souvenirs and cultural items available,” Shan said. “Our design teams often study consumer demands and create cultural items that are aesthetically pleasing and practical to use,"" Shan said. Throughout 2017, the total sales of Palace Museum's cultural items have exceeded 1 billion yuan ($158million). Explaining the huge success of Palace Museum’s cultural souvenirs, Shan said: “The museum opened a shop on the e-commerce website Taobao in 2008, but sales remained lukewarm for years, as more than 80 percent of the souvenirs sold in stores in the past were not related to our museum.” “Therefore, I wanted to change the situation. Now, souvenirs from the Palace Museum cover almost every aspect of life. After all, what matters to a museum is not how many visitors they have, but how close they are to people's daily lives.” With regard to cultural heritage restoration, Shan said the museum opened a restoration hospital at the end of 2016, which employs around 200 ""doctors"" to analyze, examine, detect flaws or damage in relics and restore them using more than 100 pieces of specialized equipment, including 3-D printers and scanners. “The restoration hospital covers 13,000 square meters and boasts the nation's most advanced restoration workshops. Traditional craftsmanship is combined with modern methods, and the lives of cultural relics will be prolonged by the ‘doctors’,” Shan added. “I must say that Shan’s speech is the most informative speech I have ever heard in Beijing as it shows a totally different Palace Museum to foreign people. In the future, I will spare more time to visit the Palace Museum and learn more about Chinese culture from the magnificent ancientartifacts,” said John Aquilina, Malta’s ambassador to China. “I really gained a lot from hearing Shan’s speech and I have the desire to visit the Palace Museum after the activity concludes. China enjoys a long and profound culture and many of the national treasures have been preserved at the Palace Museum. It is no easy task to preserve them well and I truly express my respect for Shan and his team for their contributions in the past years,” said Jiang Qi, executive deputy director general of the Beijing Diplomatic Service Bureau."
1,"It's difficult to picture Liang Xiaoqing, a 26-year-old Beijing girl, modeling for clothing brands that targets seniors and middle-aged customers. Recommended by a photographer, Liang entered the industry accidentally seven years ago. ""After my first photo shoot the brand sold 80,000 pieces,"" said Liang proudly. That experience gave her more visibility, and helped her get a foothold in the industry. ""Now, I can do a single shoot within one second,"" Liang said. ""Posing for camera comes naturally."" Some days Liang shoots in eight different locations in 24 hours. She barely had any rest time during Alibaba's ""Double Eleven"" e-commerce festival last November. From 4 am to 1 am, Liang shot 400 sets of clothing on that day, almost 40 sets in one hour.,Liang's hairdresser spends one hour on her hair before each shoot. ""Styling gel ruins my hair,"" she said. ""If I quit the job one day, it won't because of lack of offers, but because of lack of hair,"" Liang joked. ""I get well paid as a model, and the trust of customers gives me sense of achievement,"" said Liang. Shooting for brands that target seniors and middle-aged customers has become a part of my life, instead of feeling bored, I find pleasure in it, she added. There are not enough models for this market segment, said Liang, as many models still look too young even after make-up. ""Many believe modeling as a profession is the exclusive domain of youth, but I am happy because modeling for older people can be a long career,"" Liang said."
0,"In recent years, education in Lhasa, capital of the Tibet autonomous region, has made great achievements in terms of quality, teaching and vocational training, and has forged a modern comprehensive system covering all subjects and ages, the regional government said. In 2012, the government launched an education center with investment of more than 5.9 billion yuan ($878 million) to accelerate educational reform and development. The second phase of construction is in progress. Two middle schools have been established in Lhasa with the aid of Beijing and Jiangsu province, both of which invested more than 200 million yuan and dispatched first-class teachers and administrators to provide assistance. Liu Yanning, an official with the Lhasa education bureau, said the schools are advanced in every facet, including educational concepts, teaching methods and facilities. They have created a new model for educational assistance in Tibet. ""In the past, the local people sent their children to schools outside Tibet so they could receive a better education. Now, with these schools in place, our children can share the same quality resources as their counterparts in Beijing and Jiangsu,"" she said. The Lhasa Beijing Experimental School has 48 teachers from Beijing, and the Lhasa Jiangsu Experimental School has 47 educators from six cities in the province. They have improved the local students' academic performances, with 81 percent from the Beijing school and 66 percent from the Jiangsu school gaining places at universities in 2017. In 2016, the central government launched a project to send 800 teachers from middle and primary schools in 17 provinces and regions to Tibet every year to provide educational assistance. According to the Ministry of Education, the project has promoted in-depth exchanges and development between the non-Tibetan educators and local teachers and students. Lhasa's education center also has a continuing education school, where the new teachers help to tutor local educators. ""By visiting our classrooms, they can understand the current level of education in Lhasa, and then integrate their educational concepts so local teachers can become better and faster,"" Liu said. According to the 13th Five-Year Plan for Education Development (2016-20) proposed by Tibet, the region's level of education is expected to match the national average by next year."

Dalian will hold a green, secure and innovative Annual Meeting of the New Champions, equipped with 5G technology, cloud computing, facial recognition and virtual reality, said Jin Guowei, vice-mayor of the Dalian municipal government, at a news conference. Themed as Leadership 4.0: Succeeding in a New Era of Globalization, this year's Summer Davos Forum will be more open and cooperative, attracting about 2,000 international participants from more than 100 countries and regions. The percentage of international participants will reach as high as 70 percent, a historical record compared to all past annual meetings, Jin said. Noticeably, the number of US representatives ranked second, following host country China, and about 300 representatives from the US will participate in the event amid China-US trade frictions, Jin added. Li Bin, counsel for the department of international cooperation at the National Development and Reform Commission, said economic globalization is an irreversible trend and China will continue to firmly support globalization and join hands with stakeholders to safeguard world economic openness and inclusion. China will also comprehensively strengthen its international cooperation in technological innovation and grasp new opportunities for a technological revolution to promote its quality economic growth, Li said. ""At this Annual Meeting of the New Champions, we hope that through the sharing and exchanging of views, participants from diverse communities will learn how to succeed in a new era of globalization, thus providing strong momentum for China's quality economic growth and global well-being,"" said Li. David Aikman, chief representative officer of the World Economic Forum Greater China, said people should look beyond the headlines and focus on cooperation and collaboration behind the scenes. There is tremendous cooperation taking place between China and the world, including the United States, and one of the examples is a series to bring the mayors of the world together to look at sustainable and smart cities, he noted. What can people learn from China's experience of pilot cities and smart cities? How do we leverage 5G in the internet of things to make our cities more sustainable and better for living? This is just one example of the ways in which behind the scenes people are collaborating and working together, Aikman added. As many international participants would like to open the channel for economic and trade cooperation with China at the annual meeting, the organizer has for the first time arranged a special department to provide long-term, professional and individual services to member enterprises of the forum, according to Jin. An enterprise exchange meeting will also be held in the evening of July 2 for business representatives from State-owned companies, foreign enterprises, local companies and private companies to communicate for business cooperation, Jin added. Dalian held the first Summer Davos Forum in September 2007 and this is the seventh time for Dalian to hold this forum, rotating with Tianjin."

The Tingsong Academy Institute is in Wudaohe village, near the Western Qing Tombs. According to Mei, Tingsong is designed to spread the cultural heritage of her hometown, and connect local residents with the outside world. It was established to be multifunctional and contains a public library and drawing studio, and provides public lectures about traditional culture, rural construction and education issues. It also offers designed cultural products, which are closely related to the Western Qing Tombs, a famous cultural heritage in Mei's hometown. Mei helped her father with restoration work of Western Qing Tombs when she was young. She often goes sketching at the Western Qing Tombs, seeking inspiration for cultural products design work. Although facing challenges like funding issues, a lack of talent in the area and communication failure with neighboring businesses, Mei still insists on pursuing her dream of spreading traditional culture."
1,"A 48-year-old construction worker, who goes by the name of Ning Dalin, is currently working in underground Wangfujing– a downtown area of Beijing, which features shopping malls, luxury hotels, and large flows of people. Ning, who currently works on the third-stage of construction on the Beijing Metro Line 8, has been involved in four subway construction projects in the city since 2009. He also holds the head position of leading a standardization operation team at the China Railway 16th Bureau Group. According to a report by The Beijing News, 8.25 million people used the Beijing metro service each day in 2016. Without the contributions of workers, such as Ning, the underground service would be nowhere near as impressive. Ning, who spoke to chinadaily.com.cn on April 15, said one of the first steps construction workers make, when digging in the subway, is building ""ventilation, water and electricity systems"".  ""That is what my duty is,"" he said. As the project advances, Ning then checks the water pipes, high-pressure air ducts and electrical systems in the subway tunnel. He said the job takes about 40 minutes and, most times, workers do the job alone in the dark. ""I don't feel lonely or frightened,"" he said. ""I am too busy with finishing my job, checking-off my procedures, or I'm too busy being concerned with any potential problems I could face."",  When Ning spoke to chinadaily.com.cn on April 15, 2017, the construction worker confirmed he was introduced to the job, working on building Beijing metro, by a friend, but said accepting the position was initially nothing more than just being transitional. Ning was born in a small village at Xianghe county, Langfang city of North China's Hebei province, and dropped out of his first year of high school. He had a long occupational history, working in construction and maintenance.  Before he started working in the underground, Ning ran a small business during the 1990s; however, transitioned into making a living by doing the odd job here and there after having a failed investment. ""Then I found my current job,"" he said. ""I didn't regard it as a long-term career at that time, because the company only paid about 1,800 yuan a month at the beginning, and that was very low."" On top of the pay, Ning recalled the poor working environment when he started in underground construction, and said he constantly suffered chapped facial skin during the summer while conducting electric welding work. ""There was no enclosed facility back then, so the tunnel, which was full of holes, was frozenly cold in the winter, and was hot and muggy in summer,"" he said. ""Also, because we did not use any dust removal equipment, the first thing we had to do after work each day was washing our noses, and then we could go for dinner."" While Ning did not believe he would be working underground for more than a year and a half, he has been there eight years and does not see himself changing careers anytime soon. ""As an honest, hard-working person, I feel a sense of achievement every time I finish a task,"" he said.,    The gratification brought by the job maximized when Ning takes the subway built by him.""I was involved in the early construction of Beijing Metro Line 10, and when my co-workers and I heard the line was open in 2013 – while we were dining at a restaurant–we rushed to the subway station to take a ride. ""We were very excited."" Ning further confirmed the leadership of the company was another reason why he stayed. ""The people are responsible, kind and thoughtful,"" he said. ""Especially my project manager; he is only in his thirties, and teaches and inspires me a lot."" Ning has also since learnt a variety of skills from the job, which he started in maintenance work. ""Now I can handle spray-painting, wall building and tiling,"" he said. ""The electronic screen hanging on the entrance of our construction site is one of my 'masterpieces'."" Speaking of a popular saying among other workers of the project - ""If you have trouble, just go for Ning"", Ning feels proud. ""I guess it is because I have worked here for a long time and am well-experienced so people can depend on me."" Xiao Yang, an engineer who has been working with Ning for years, said his colleague's efficiency and frankness impressed him daily. Ning said:""If you have been on a job for years, you will have a kind of loyalty to your company and colleagues. For new comers, most times they just do what they are told; for me, I feel there are many other things I should concern about. I have developed my own responsibility."",While Ning has struggle with not having a college degree throughout his working life, he has been given the chance to study in his current role, with the help and influence of his current project manager.  ""Wang Haimin, my project manager, impresses me a lot with his profound knowledge,"" he said. ""He is also from a rural village."" ""During our lunch breaks, I often read news stories, books or even WeChat subscriptions. ""I have realized there is a lot of information about machines and our work on the internet."" As Ning enjoys his job and is the backbone of his family, he said he would like to continue his position for at least another decade. Ning earns about 200 yuan each day and believed his physical condition would be good enough to continue on, despite the company's regulations of not hiring migrant workers aged 55-years and above. Zhang Shengchu, head security of the company, said the company prefers to hire migrants under the age of 50, with a maximum of 55 years, as the labor is hard. ""For workers, like Ning, who still want to do their role after the age of 55, they will have to switch over and become cleaners,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, it means their salaries will decrease, but it's because the construction workers are paid relatively well now."" Zhang also said he held concern for the future of the company, in regards to its employees, as a majority of the workers are in their late forties. ""Young people are not willing to do this job,"" he said.,  ""Even though they will make considerable money, it is still going to be hard work. ""It seems they would rather to be a security guard or trucker."" Xiao, the engineer, said he has also noticed the aging ""trend"". ""Even though the working environment has improved significantly, the work is still very hard, especially in the less-mechanized underground digging project,"" he said. ""We often discuss who will do the job after Ning's generation retires.  ""I guess the labor dilemma can force the process of mechanization."" Ning, who also commented on the issue, said he did not worry about whether if he could keep his job after the age of 55 or if his work would be replaced by machines.  ""I had not really thought that far ahead,"" he said. ""I believe there will be no problem as long as you have a strong inner strength and body. ""I just hope all of the construction workers, like me, can do their jobs safely and happily, so they can take good care of their families."","

Museum director Shan Jixiang delivered the keynote speech, welcoming the foreign guests and sharing his stories of the museum, which has a profound history of almost 600 years. In Shan's speech, he discussed the Palace Museum's effective practices and rich experiences in terms of exhibitions, services, facilities, the development of cultural creative products, the digital Imperial Palace and environmental protection. The curator also said that to better museum work, confidence in Chinese culture should be strengthened, as cultural confidence can serve as a driving force to help museums grow and prosper and make cultural relics ""come to life"". Martin Mpana, Cameroonian Ambassador to China, expressed his gratitude for inviting so many diplomats to the museum.,“It is really a golden opportunity for foreign friends to visit and get a deeper understanding of the renowned Imperial Palace. The speech has shown us a brand-new Palace Museum and provided a better understanding of Chinese culture.” Under the guidance of Shan, foreign diplomats have toured several classic scenic spots including Jianfu Palace, Xiehe Gate, Taihe Gate, Zhonghe Gate, Baohe Gate, Cining Palace and Shoukkang Palace. They have also visited shops that sell cultural and creative products. Currently, Palace Museum has developed over 9,100 cultural products, with an annual sales volume exceeding one billion yuan ($158.4 million). “I really like those products, as they are symbols of ancient Chinese culture. I can buy lots of gifts here for my friends in my home country as the prices are not that high,” said Irena Skardziuviene, Minister Counselor of the Embassy of the Republic of Lithuania."

Xi made the remark at a commendation conference to honor outstanding figures in the country's sports sector before he declared the opening of the quadrennial National Games. Sport carries the dreams of prosperity and rejuvenation of the Chinese nation as it represents a country's prowess and fortune, so China should quickly build itself into a world sporting power through dedicated planning and sound implementation, Xi said. As Beijing prepares to host the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games, Xi urged the country to take advantage of the high-profile occasion to promote balanced development of competitive sports, mass sports and the sports industry to enhance the athletic prowess and improve nation’s overall fitness, Xi said. Xi stressed that the country's sports development should address the public's growing demand for greater sports participation and higher fitness levels. The reform of including amateurs in the National Games program is a positive step, he added. The Tianjin games opened 19 events to amateur participation, a first in the games' 58-year history. Earlier on Sunday, Xi met with International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach and Sheikh Ahmad al-Fahad al-Sabah, president of the Olympic Council of Asia, who both attended the opening ceremony. During his meeting with Bach, Xi said preparations for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics are going smoothly.,  ""We will fully honor our commitments that we made during the bid process and deliver a fantastic, extraordinary and excellent Winter Games,"" he said. China will continue to support the IOC and cooperate with the IOC on issues including the Olympic Movement, sports' role in promoting world peace and development as well as the development of sports in China, he added. After the Beijing Winter Olympics, Chinese city Hangzhou in Zhejiang province will host the 19th Asian Games in September 2022, maintaining the world sports exposure in China. Xi pledged during his meeting with Sheikh Ahmad, the chief of Asian sports, that China will fully support Hangzhou's preparation for the Asian Games. Sheikh Ahmad expressed his admiration toward Xi's foresight to promote Chinese sports and the international Olympic Movement, as well as his appreciation for China's long-term support to the OCA.

It was the second year that the World Leading Internet Scientific and Technological Achievement awards had been presented. This year, Alibaba Group, Baidu, Huawei Technologies and Mobike Technology shared the honors with Amazon, Microsoft and Apple. Technologies such as the internet of things or IoT, supercomputing, artificial intelligence and virtual reality featured prominently in the selections of the judges. Few companies have had such a dramatic impact on the physical landscape of China and other cities around the world as Mobike Technology, with millions of consumers now renting its shared bicycles every day. Wang Xiaofeng, co-founder and chief executive officer of the Beijing-based company, said he was sitting in his office with colleagues three years ago and wondered what the solution was to air pollution and traffic jams. ""We noticed also that the usage of bicycles had declined and wondered whether this could be reversed. We came up with a solution that combined smartphone technology with GPS tracking systems."" Mobike launched in Shanghai in April 2016. Now, it has 8 million bikes in 200 cities across the world. Huawei Technologies won its award for its next-generation mobile communications 3GPP 5G pre-commercial system. It will launch a smartphone to support the technology in 2019 when its chip will be also launched. ""With the 5G technology, users will be able to download a 6-gigabyte file in less than two seconds,"" said Xu Zhijun, rotating CEO of the company. Alibaba Group won the award for ET Brain, its next-generation cloud computing technology. Zhang Yong, CEO of Alibaba, said developments in the internet field over the next 10 years could transform all sectors. ""They could be as significant as were the moon landings in a similar period of development,"" he said. Baidu won its award for its new digital assistant DuerOS, which will take on Apple's Siri and other competitors. Its digital assistant responds vocally to whatever question is asked of it, even on an emotional level. Zhang Yaqin, president of Baidu, said at a news conference after the awards ceremony that people should not be concerned about artificial intelligence destroying jobs. ""Artificial intelligence is only a computer system. It does not have human consciousness or sense,"" he said."

Xi made the remarks in a congratulatory message to the 2019 China International Fair for Trade in Services, which opened in Beijing on Tuesday. China remains committed to promoting opening-up at an even higher level, Xi said, and the country firmly upholds the multilateral trading system. With the acceleration of economic globalization, trade in services has increasingly become an important part of international trade and a key area in economic and trade cooperation among countries, Xi noted, adding that it has injected fresh impetus into the global economy. Mentioning that trade in services has broad prospects and huge potential for development, he urged countries to seize the opportunity and join hands to build a better future of global services for mutual benefit and shared growth. China stands ready to intensify cooperation with various countries on trade in services and investment, enhance liberalization and facilitation of trade and investment, and push for economic globalization to develop in an open, inclusive, mutually beneficial, balanced and win-win manner, Xi said. He expressed the hope that participants in the five-day event will strengthen their cooperation to promote the growth of global trade in services and guide global economic development in order to benefit the people of all countries and advance the building of a community with a shared future for mankind. Formerly the China (Beijing) International Fair for Trade in Services, the fair aims to have global influence and lead the innovative development of domestic and global trade in services. The theme of the fair is Opening-up, Innovation, Intelligence and Integration. Enterprises and organizations from 137 countries and regions are taking part in the event. Trade in services refers to the sale and delivery of intangible products such as transportation, tourism, telecommunications, construction, advertising, computing and accounting. ""China has already taken steps to improve the development of trade in services, including gradually opening up the finance, education, culture and medical treatment sectors, as well as introducing the first new negative list for cross-border service trade in the China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone last year to offer global companies more access,"" said Bai Ming, a senior researcher at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation. Eager to compete with their global counterparts, Bai said Chinese cities such as Shenzhen, Hangzhou and Wuhan are also innovating and diversifying service trade, including spearheading the development of digital service trade and promoting digital service outsourcing. China has trade in services with more than 200 countries and regions. Its service trade volume reached 1.29 trillion yuan ($186.81 billion) in the first quarter of this year, up 2.6 percent year-on-year, while its service export volume topped 463.49 billion yuan, up 10.3 percent, according to the Ministry of Commerce."

In the speech, President Xi extended his New Year greetings to Chinese people of all ethnic groups, to compatriots in the Hong Kong SAR, the Macao SAR and Taiwan, to overseas Chinese, as well as to people from all countries and regions around the world. Following are some highlights: President Xi hailed China’s achievements in 2017 in his New Year Address, saying that China has embarked on a journey to fully build a modern socialist country. As various initiatives to improve people's livelihoods have been accelerated and the environment has steadily improved, Chinese people have enjoyed a stronger sense of gain, of happiness and of security, Xi said, adding that China has marched one significant step closer to completing the process of building a moderately well-off society in all aspects.

0,"With venues taking shape and event planning in progress, Beijing has stepped up preparations for the 2022 Winter Olympics. At the same time, advisers are calling on the organizers to pay great attention to the Games' legacy to ensure the event has a lasting impact. The National Stadium, aka the Bird's Nest, in the north of Beijing's downtown, remembered by many as the main venue for the 2008 Summer Olympics, now offers a host of winter sports attractions. On March 1, the stadium hosted a cross-country skiing race that saw competitors traversing artificial snow as they circled the giant structure, thrilling onlookers with a Nordic flavor never seen before in the Chinese capital. The race, organized by the International Ski Federation as part of its shorter-distance, urbanized cross-country sprint series, was a hot topic among the sports panel of the 13th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference as the top political advisory body met in Beijing. The public interest generated by the race served as a testament to the growing appreciation of winter sports in China in the buildup to the 2022 Olympics, according to Li Yingchuan, a CPPCC National Committee member and a vice-minister of the General Administration of Sport of China. ""It proved a success in drawing attention to winter events in urban areas,"" Li told China Daily after a panel discussion on Monday. ""As demonstrated by this race, we could turn potentially hundreds of millions of people into new winter sports fans when we host the 2022 Games, which would not only be a legacy for us, but for the entire global winter sports community."" The country's commitment to hosting excellent Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games in 2022 and using the showcase events to encourage mass participation in winter sports and promote the industry's growth was highlighted in the annual Government Work Report, which was delivered by Premier Li Keqiang at the second session of the 13th National People's Congress on Tuesday. During his presentation, Premier Li outlined the tasks for the country's sports sector this year, urging organizers ""to make thorough preparations for the Beijing Winter Olympics and Paralympics and to extensively promote mass sports participation."",The 2022 Winter Games will be held at 26 competition and noncompetition venues in three zones: downtown Beijing; Yanqing, a district in the city's northwestern suburbs; and co-host Zhangjiakou in Hebei province. The clusters will be connected by a new high-speed railway, which is due to be completed by the end of the year. At the core of Beijing's venue readiness is the use of existing facilities, which is intended to cut spending while diversifying the venues' operations. For the 13 venues required for competition and non-competition functions in the downtown, where the ice sports events will be held, Beijing will repurpose 11 existing venues and other projects left over from the 2008 Games. For example, the National Aquatics Center－aka ""the Water Cube"", which hosted the swimming events in 2008－will be transformed into an ""Ice Cube"" for the curling competition by filling the pool with retractable structures and covering them with sheets of ice. Work is already underway. Being able to shift between swimming and curling will diversify the venue's business operations, revenue stream and public services, said Yang Qiyong, general manager of the facility. To the north of the Cube, the National Indoor Stadium－built to host gymnastics in 2008－is upgrading its temperature-control system and lighting facilities as it is remodeled to hold ice hockey events in 2022. The transformation of both venues is expected to be finished by the end of the year, while the remodeling of all existing facilities, including the Bird's Nest and the National Convention Center, for ceremonies and media operations will be completed in 2021, according to the Beijing Major Projects Construction Headquarters Office, the regulatory body for construction. ""As a key milestone leading up to 2022, venue readiness will take a major step forward in 2019, with construction and renovation going on across all fronts. We are well ahead of schedule to be ready for a series of test events starting in early 2020,"" said Wang Gang, director of the office. According to the official legacy plan released by Beijing 2022 last month, some new, permanent venues, such as the National Speed Skating Oval in the downtown and the National Alpine Ski Center in Yanqing, have developed post-Games business models, not just for sports but also tourism and exhibitions. ""Here, you have the venues from 2008 that are going to be used in 2022 for a complete set of winter sports. This is a wonderful legacy story,"" said Juan Antonio Samaranch, vice-president of the International Olympic Committee, during a visit to Beijing in January. According to construction regulators in Beijing and Hebei, all of the venues for 2022 will be ready by June next year. They include eight in Zhangjiakou, which will be used for six snow sports: snowboarding; freestyle skiing; cross-country skiing; ski jumping; Nordic combined; and biathlon.,China was a late starter in the development of winter sports. That means a lack of expertise in competition organization, event management and technical support in almost two-thirds of Olympic winter sports, especially those on snow, has been a pressing issue. In response, the organizing committee for 2022 has pulled out all the stops to train staff members, while recruiting, and learning from, international experts. According to Wang Yanxia, a CPPCC National Committee member and a deputy director of the Sports Department of the Beijing 2022 Organizing Committee, 3,000 technical officials for ice sports alone were trained last year. However, that may not be enough. ""It's highly technical and demanding for Games' staff members in certain areas such as alpine medical support, snow making and course grooming,"" she said. ""We have to train our own people to levels of Olympic proficiency so they can be real assets for us and keep winter sports thriving after the Games."" Assembled by the 2022 organizing committee, a volunteer skiing team, selected from a pool of more than 3,000 medium-level skiers, has undertaken regular training programs at ski resorts in Zhangjiakou. The Genting Resort Secret Garden in Zhangjiakou's Chongli district, where the freestyle skiing and snowboarding events will be held, has hired renowned course shaper Alli Zehetner to lead a Chinese crew that has built and maintains the Olympic half-pipe course at the resort, thus allowing the Austrian's experience and know-how to be absorbed and shared. According to the Sports Department of Beijing 2022, event managers have been appointed for all 15 sports disciplines at the 2022 Games. They are being trained by employees of a number of sports federations, and their skills will be tested at upcoming World Cup series events. ""All the facilities and personnel for the 2022 Winter Olympics will be 80 percent ready by the end of 2019,"" said Tong Lixin, the department's director.,Another major task this year will see the Beijing 2022 organizing committee working with local partners, the IOC and respective winter sports federations to refine plans for transportation, catering and accommodations for athletes. The goal is to offer the athletes an unforgettable experience in 2022 to honor the promise Beijing made in the candidature phase to host an athlete-centered Olympics, according to Yang Yang, a CPPCC National Committee member and two-time Olympic champion in short-track speedskating. ""Meeting the demands of participating athletes plays a big part in the success of hosting the Olympics,"" said Yang, who chairs the athletes' commission for Beijing 2022. ""We hope to turn every athlete into our promoter in 2022 by providing them with the best services possible."" Those services include providing the athletes with clean, gluten-free food to Olympic standards with Chinese characteristics, designing special bullet train cars to facilitate easy transportation of skis and snowboards, and guaranteeing enough tickets for every athlete's family members. Reflecting on her experience a year ago, when she returned to Salt Lake City in Utah, where she won China's first two Winter Olympics gold medals (500 meters and 1,000 meters) at the 2002 Games, Yang suggested that each competition venue for 2022 should leave a space where the names of every participating athlete and the medalists' handprints could be displayed. ""I felt so sad returning to the former ice sports center in Salt Lake City (now the home arena of the NBA team Utah Jazz) and finding there was nothing there about my performances in 2002,"" she said. ""I don't want to see the athletes in 2022 experience the same disappointment I felt last year. In addition to providing them with best possible conditions for their competitions, I'd like to see more athletes' stories respected and told here in Beijing."
0,"An exchange program recently brought together 38 Sinologists from 34 countries for research and study at several institutes in Beijing. The Beijing Class of the 2018 Visiting Program for Young Sinologists, which will last for three weeks, kicked off on July 6 in Beijing. Speaking at the launch of the program, Zhu Qi, vice-director of the foreign affairs bureau of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, says: ""As China enters a new era, modern Sinology also offers new development opportunities. So, young sinologists have huge potential for building a strong bridge between the Chinese people and other nations."" The program, which was started by the ministry in 2014, aims to strengthen cultural exchanges and set up a platform for young Sinologists worldwide to communicate and learn more about Chinese culture and history. ""And during the past five years, the program has promoted ideological and cultural exchanges between China and other countries. It also constantly sums up useful experiences and takes an innovative approach to training, to create better conditions for young Sinologists coming to China,"" says Zhu.,Meanwhile, the Sinologists-after attending three days of lectures by Chinese scholars-were divided into different groups according to their research fields and were asked to conduct specific research at relevant academic organizations or universities, including Peking University, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the Beijing Language and Culture University, for about two weeks. They will then visit Guizhou province in Southwest China to learn about its ethnic culture and eco-civilization practices. Later, the sinologists will interact with their Chinese professors on academic research and their theses. Separately, five participants from countries including the United States, Nepal, and Serbia shared their stories about what they learned about Chinese culture during their studies in China.,American participant David Solomon, who works for the US-China Business Council, says: ""It (the program) was a unique opportunity for me to work with a diverse group of scholars and practitioners who are passionate and curious about China and its relationship with the rest of the world,"" he says. Solomon says his passion for understanding China began more than a decade ago, when he visited Beijing for the first time. And he has remained passionate about engaging with China as a rising global giant, both personally and professionally. This year's program will feature sessions in five cities besides Beijing, including Shanghai, Chongqing and Guangdong, and will involve more than 200 participants, according to the ministry."
0,"A bare fragment of great canon remains after it was slowly dismembered over several centuries. To the same degree that the compilation over just five years of the 11,095 volumes of the Great Canon of the Yongle Era and their ensuing transcription was a stupendous feat of research and craftsmanship, the loss of the great bulk of that work over several centuries is a thumping indictment of some of man's worst excesses, including greed and theft. As a result, what should be a glimmering jewel of culture reposing in a Chinese institution for all the world to wonder at was scattered to the four winds, one or two bits held here and another one or two bits there, but the vast bulk of it simply lost. Instead the world has been left to wonder what happened to it all. Among the fortunate few in this sad tale are institutions in about a dozen countries, including the British Library, the Berlin State Library in Germany, and libraries of Harvard, Princeton and Oxford universities into whose hands some remnants of the canon's glories were fortunate enough to fall. The National Library of China Publishing House has published 57 photocopies of volumes collected overseas, and more photocopies of collection in Japan, Ireland and Britain will be published in the near future. A lot of effort has gone into collecting, restoring and preserving the surviving relics of the masterpiece. The National Library of China holds the largest collection of surviving volumes, 224 in all and 62 of them are temporarily kept in Taipei, and is always keen for the public to enjoy them. To that end an exhibition is held, says Gu Heng, deputy director of the library's exhibition department. The exhibits, including 12 transcript volumes, recounted anecdotes about the masterpiece's compilation, preservation, duplication and disappearance, as well as speculation about the whereabouts of the lost volumes. That speculation includes that the original canon was burned or buried with Emperor Jiajing (1507-67), a theory that still has currency. The transcript of the original, completed in 1567, was firstly placed in an imperial archive southeast of the Forbidden City in Beijing, the imperial palace for the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties. It was not until the time of Emperor Kangxi (1654-1722) that the transcript was rediscovered. By that time the canon had already been severely degraded. Over about 150 years it had little attention from emperors, and it apparently became the wont of officials to visit the site where they were located and walk off with a few volumes. By 1722, 2,422 rolls, or more than 1,000 volumes, had disappeared. When British and French troops invaded Beijing in 1860 and then moved out of China they took many more volumes with them, and Yang Yinmin, a research librarian at the National Library of China, believes the Western world was well aware even then about how valuable the canon was. By 1875 just 5,000 volumes remained in the Hanlin Academy, a major cultural body for the feudal government, and within 20 years 4,200 of those vanished. The invasion by the Eight-Nation Alliance in 1900 caused further damage to the canon mainly through fire and theft. Trading in the canons became highly lucrative, some officials selling volumes they took out to foreigners for 10 taels of silver (1 tael is about 37 grams), the equivalent of about 10,000 yuan ($1,500) today. When the construction of the National Peking Library, predecessor of the National Library of China, was proposed in 1908 just 64 volumes were left. It was with the help of Lu Xun, renowned author and then an official at the ministry of education, that 60 volumes were turned over to the library in 1912; the other four were turned over in 1928. One of those was put on display in the library, along with 11 others that had been privately donated or had been returned by foreign institutions. The exhibits included one that begins with the entry men (door). One of the volume's illustrations was the inspiration of the design on the doors of the National Museum of Classic Books, where the exhibition is held. The museum shares its location with the National Library of China. The library is also the leading institution for the country's preservation of ancient texts. It undertook a nine-month long restoration of the canon collection beginning in September 2002. At the time, most of the staff who worked on the restoration had more than 15 years of expertise in the field. The principle was to ""restore the old as the old"", keeping its original shape as close as possible to the original and maintaining the historical traces. Du Weisheng, one of the 16 restorers, says that taking apart the pages and finding suitable materials were the project's major difficulties. Hanji, a kind of white tissue paper of the early Qing Dynasty that the library kept, was used to replace the broken paper, Du said. Staff also visited almost all the silk stores in Beijing trying to find a silk identical to that used in making the cover of the canon, but they turned up empty-handed. However, they did find a decorative fabric that was similar in texture, thickness and color. In all, 158 volumes were restored, and Du says he felt a strong sense of achievement on seeing the revival of the ancient books. Du has restored documents for 44 years and says he has witnessed many changes in the field, including more skilled people entering the field. The restoration effort of the canon benefited greatly from the support of the government and the public and media attention, he said, and this had promoted the standardization of the work."

""Austria has been trying to be very present in China in the lead up to the Winter Olympics in 2022,"" said Glatz at the Austrian Winter Sports Days 2019 Conference in Zhangjiakou, Hebei province on Friday. ""Ten years ago when we organized for the first time the Advantage Austria Ski Race, not many people took alpine skiing very seriously. But now skiing has entered the mainstream in China,"" said Glatz, who is also the head of Advantage Austria Beijing. China rolled out a national program to boost the development of winter sports after Beijing won the bid for the 2022 Winter Olympic Games. ""That's an opportunity not only for our Chinese friends to get some fresh air outside the big cities, but also is an opportunity for Austrian companies to get involved with Chinese partners to develop the market and to offer the best of equipment both in terms of consumer goods and in devices,"" Glatz added.,According to the ambitious plan released by the General Administration of Sport of China in 2016 to construct winter sports infrastructure and popularize winter sports, at least 650 skating rinks and 800 ski resorts are expected to be build nationwide by 2022. By 2025, about 300 million people in the country are expected to participate in winter sports, increasing the market value of the winter sports sector to 1 trillion yuan. Driven by multiple momentums, China has witnessed rapid growth in the winter sports industry in recent years, such as venue facilities, training, tourism and equipment sectors, said Peng Weiyong, deputy director general of Finance Department at the General Administration of Sports. Winter sports has become a booster for China's sports industry and even economic development, Peng added. By the end of June 2018, the total number of ski resorts in China rose to 738, an increase of 70 or 10.5 percent over the same period in 2017. The number of indoor ice rinks totaled 334, an increase of 75 or 29 percent year-on-year increase. In 2018, 19.7 million people participated in skiing, up 12.6 percent year-on-year.,China is by far Austria's greatest trading partner in Asia, said Friedrich Stift, Austria's ambassador to China. Bilateral trade between China and Austria reached $6.4 billion in the first eight months of last year, up 20 percent year-on-year, according to the Foreign Ministry. As of August 2018, China has approved 1,288 investment projects from Austria, with an actual investment of $2.08 billion, signed 2,263 technology import contracts with Austria, with a cumulative contract value of $6.23 billion and directly invested $880 million in Austria. ""I'm pleased that a group number of Austrian companies got the chance to take part in the construction of winter sports facilities and to provide the expertise for organizing great sports events like the Olympics,"" Stift said. ""We are trying hard to get more Austrian ski instructors and trainers to China and the greater number of Chinese winter sports tourists to Austria"". Besides winter sports, Austria is one of the most favorite travel destinations for Chinese tourists for is beautiful landscape, food and shopping. ""The growth rate, especially in winter tourism has been phenomenal the last few years,"" said Glatz. ""Winter is a season when Chinese tourists should go to Austria to experience a very different landscape from what they would see during the dry months in the summer months,"" added Glatz. The number of Chinese tourists in Australia might reach one million this year, said Stift."

1,"ATLANTIC, the United States - A trip to China in February has boosted the confidence of Bill Pellett, a farmer in the US state of Iowa, in selling more of his farm's prime beef to Chinese customers. During his one-week stay in China, Pellett met with representatives from seven to 10 different companies that have plans for importing American beef, including a hotel chain and JD.com, a major online retailer in China. ""We talked a lot about the quality and the safety of the product and tried to give as many insurances that this was the safest product from anywhere in the world. I think that's important to the Chinese people,"" Pellett said. Last June, Pellett's beef was in the first boxes of US beef shipped to China shortly after the United States and China reached a deal to re-open the Chinese market to US beef. The beef was shipped by Pellett's exporter Greater Omaha Packing Co. China banned U.S. beef in December 2003 after the mad cow disease struck US cattle. Before the ban, the United States used to be China's top foreign supplier of beef. Although Pellett's foreign clients are primarily European nations, including Germany, Italy and Switzerland, he sees good potential of expanding business with China. ""There will be a slow building of the demand for our product because of the quality and the health insurances,"" he said, highlighting the need to change the way their beef is presented and make it better fit the Chinese lifestyle and customs. Though only a small quantity is being exported to China, the American beef is ""something that will gain popularity as time goes on,"" Pellett said. He is now feeding around 900 head of cattle on his farm while growing hundreds of acres of corn and soybeans in the Midwestern state. A portion of the grain will hopefully make its way into the Chinese market someday, he said. During his first and only trip to China, Pellett visited Beijing and Shanghai, and had a chance to travel on a high-speed train. He was amazed by what he saw. ""I was very impressed by the infrastructure because I did not expect it to be as good as it was. Just the ability and the potential of the country was very, very surprising to me,"" he said. The trip, he said, was ""very fruitful"" in that it helped him learn more about the Chinese people, business dealings in China and how to effectively present U.S. beef. Citing other farmers from his community, Pellett said they are highly interested in the huge opportunities that such a large and growing market as China could bring. ""They want the (Chinese) market to happen...We don't know a lot about China, but we want to know more. We don't want politicians to get in the way of what's best for both countries,"" he said. Aware of fellow farmers' concerns over the current US-China trade tension, Pellett said he is optimistic about the prospect. In the end, he said, ""The needs of the people will come to the surface"" and arrangements will be made accordingly to ensure that people get what they want."

Chapuis also said that the EU is one of the major markets for Chinese culture, and more Europeans are appreciating Chinese writing and culture. Hungarian writer and TV host Zsolna Ugron said her affection for Chinese literature goes back to centuries-old classics, such as The Dream of the Red Chamber. She even fell for Chinese historical television dramas during her stay in Hong Kong years ago. She created a Chinese female character in her own historical novel, where the girl rises to become a member of the Hungarian royal house.

1,"Premier Li Keqiang has pledged to make doing business in China more inviting by facilitating overseas investment and widening market access to the world's second-largest economy. Li spoke on Wednesday when meeting a group of multinational corporate leaders — including the CEOs of Goldman Sachs, Schneider Electric and Phillips Corp — attending the fifth Global CEO Council roundtable summit in Beijing. He said China, with its huge market potential, wealth of talent and growing industrial strength, will not only benefit multinational companies' investments but also create opportunities for joint exploration of third-party markets and multilateral cooperation. China will also work to better protect intellectual property rights and further promote the use of negative lists for a more convenient and equitable policy environment for overseas investors, the premier stressed. Negative lists specify areas where investment is prohibited — all other areas are presumed to be open. Reform of supervision, facilitation of trade, innovation capacity and widening market access for overseas investors were among key topics during the one-hour conversation between Li and business leaders. Li said China is determined to promote economic globalization, free trade and investment, as these form an environment in which fair competition and innovation is nurtured. China will not retreat in its opening-up, and is resolved to open its door wider to the global market, he said, ?adding that Beijing is ready to work hand-in-hand with others to promote multilateralism and improve global governance. Issues raised by the 20 or so business leaders during the conversation included widening market access, promoting innovation and improving the business environment. In response, Li said hurdles for foreign investment access will be further eliminated. The government has rolled out measures to promote compliant market regulation, he said. He encouraged business leaders to seize opportunities to grow their businesses in step with China's economic development. Andrew Liveris, CEO of the US-based Dow Chemical Co, agreed with Li's position on globalization, saying it is ""like gravity"" and unstoppable. Liveris said Dow is ready to work with countries like China, which is ""open for business and care about competitiveness as well as humanity"". Steven Mollenkopf, CEO of Qualcomm, also based in the United States, said Qualcomm is looking forward to seeing an environment in China with more streamlined regulation and facilitation of investment, adding that the company is ready to work with China to develop new energy vehicles and technical innovation. By October 2016, reforms meant that about 95 percent of items that required approvals in China had been replaced by registration.

And 2018 provided the perfect opportunity as it was the 40th anniversary of reform and opening-up. Speaking about why he wanted to make the documentary, Liu says: ""Everyone has heard of Zhongguancun, but some still think it's a market for electronic goods."" As he researched Zhongguancun, he realized the electronics market was just the outcome of one phase of the area's development. So what is the secret of Zhongguancun, and what does it mean for the social and economic development of today's society? With these questions in mind, Liu started to shoot the documentary. The six-episode documentary named after the area, aired in December on the science and education channel of China Central Television, looks at Chinese entrepreneurs and internet companies such as Baidu, Sohu and Netease. According to Jin Ling, the producer, the documentary took 18 months to complete. ""Many think that Zhongguancun is just a place in Beijing's Haidian district, but this documentary also includes 17 locations in the city,"" says Jin. A special film crew took more than one year to shoot scenes in Zhongguancun in different seasons. And a research team was assigned to collect historical material, including photos, videos, documents and newspapers that would showcase the story of Zhongguancun.,""The first generation of the entrepreneurs provided us with many rare materials, including old photos, mails, manuscripts and products,"" says Jin. And museums and corporate archives were also sources of material for the research team, as they contained documents such as the first registration certificate of a privately owned high-tech company. ""We also got material from the public. For example, an early Lenovo computer in the documentary is borrowed from a technology enthusiast,"" says Jin. The documentary features more than 100 people, including entrepreneurs, scientists, professionals, government officials and others who witnessed the development of Zhongguancun. Ni Guangnan from the Chinese Academy of Engineering impressed Liu with his attitude. ""He is still thinking about development and industrialization, and he is also helping young people,"" says Liu.,Two themes connect the stories in the six-episode documentary-one is the timeline and the other focuses on the development of Zhongguancun, from independent innovation centers there to market reforms and international cooperation. ""The significance of Zhongguancun is to show how science and technology is the primary productive force, and the importance of fundamental research and talent training,"" says Liu. One of Liu's interviewees says in the film that Zhongguancun is a top hub of scientific and technological innovation. Liu says the people in Zhongguancun ""live in the future"". ""Our discussion about the significance of Zhongguancun is actually exploring the future,"" Liu adds."

Passengers can buy single-ride tickets or use a rechargeable fare card for a ride. But soon, Beijing Subway will offer passengers more ticket options, with the one-day pass the first to be launched, Beijing Daily reported. The one-day pass, valid for 24 hours of unlimited metro rail travel, will be convenient for visitors to Beijing and benefit the development of tourism in the city. The pass, which will be available in QR code format, will save tourists the trouble of returning their public transport cards before leaving Beijing. The city also plans to accelerate construction of the first phase of Line 3, the second phase of Line 16, and Line 12 this year, the transportation commission said. Beijing had 22 metro lines and a total length of 636.8 kilometers in operation by the end of 2018."

Ames spoke slowly in Chinese at the eighth annual meeting of the Academy for International Communication of Chinese Culture, part of Beijing Normal University, in late November in Beijing. The Toronto-born Sinologist, 70, whose Chinese name is An Lezhe, is a professor emeritus at the University of Hawaii. In 1966, when he visited Hong Kong as an exchange student, his roommate gave him  . He plunged into Chinese philosophy thereafter. Taught by the leading figures of China's contemporary Neo-Confucianism movement, Ames got to know about an academic world that was different from the one built by Greek philosophers Plato and Aristotle. He studied Sino-Western comparative philosophy and translated Chinese classics such as   and   into English. Ames' translation of a well-known poem by Chinese poet Su Shi of the Song Dynasty (960-1279) showed it bore an understanding similarly expressed later in Western literature, implying that two worlds exist－one outside and one inside and that one should go to outside to see clearly what is inside. Ames says the world is a system of ""intranational relations"" rather than international, and while ""inter"" puts independent things together to build new relations, ""intra"" seeks to develop existing relations. And, as an expert on comparative philosophy, this is the view he holds while looking at China's Belt and Road Initiative. ""The concept of international relations is based on individualism,"" he says, adding that as a result a binary opposition of ""stand or fall"" has been created. The world is one community with multiple countries, and people should pursue and develop the ""intra"" relations with mutual understanding and trust, he adds. Ames says China is less confident about its culture after witnessing a century of foreign invasions in modern history. ""Chinese culture is rooted in people's life and language. Yet, with the rapid economic development and changes in society, the younger generation may get lost."" ""The world is calling for the success of the Belt and Road Initiative. Chinese culture is also a cultural resource for the world and this should be China's part of the contribution, just like Beethoven's music not only belongs to the Germans but the whole world."""

1,"If you have a question, search on Zhihu. Chinese viewers who watched the 2018 World Cup will certainly remember the much-watched commercial for Zhihu, a popular question-and-answer service provider. In the commercial, Chinese actor Liu Haoran asks the viewer again and again what Zhihu is. Though some viewers found the commercial disturbing, it actually worked for Zhihu. Launched in 2011, the Quora-like knowledge sharing platform is no longer a simple follower of the foreign trendsetter. Fueled by forward thinking investors and venture capital firms, Zhihu is actively embracing the burgeoning paid content boom across the nation, extending to far more businesses than its foreign counterparts do. ""The knowledge service market is huge,"" said Zhou Yuan, founder and chief executive officer of Zhihu. ""It is so huge that the market will be worth hundreds of millions of yuan in the future. ""Currently, the local market is still in its early stages, lacking sufficient services and products that can meet the specific needs of users. As a knowledge sharing platform, Zhihu is dedicated to connecting knowledge service providers with consumers in a more efficient way."" The Beijing-based website and app has already proved to be a runaway success. It has transformed from a previous invitation-only community into a platform that aims to serve the whole nation, gearing up to expand the paid-for-content business. And the community has also shifted the focus from targeting the elite groups to the general public. By the end of August this year, Zhihu had gained more than 200 million registered users, up by more than 100 percent year-on-year. The company said it has accumulated more than 120 million answers. Statistics from app tracker Analysys Qianfan show Zhihu had more than 16 million monthly active users in September. Zhihu's revenue mainly comes from advertisements and the paid-for-content business. During the first six months of this year, it reported a 340 percent year-on-year growth in revenue. The company, however, did not disclose the exact figures on profits or losses. The company has also upgraded its previous function Zhihu Market and renamed it Zhihu University, to offer a wider range of paid knowledge services, such as online courses, audio books and training camps. Its services span the genres of general knowledge, professional knowledge and content related to people's interests and hobbies. Zhang Rongle, Zhihu's vice-president and head of the Zhihu University business, said the internet has affected the way people impart knowledge. ""The younger generation is more willing to learn knowledge heuristically and interactively. We hope that the Zhihu University will offer standardized content and comprehensive knowledge services, to help users have better access to the knowledge they really need,"" Zhang said. With more than 5,000 content producers, the platform provides a total of over 15,000 paid knowledge service products, gaining more than 6 million paid users. Investors have also shown great interest in the knowledge economy model. In August, Zhihu secured a $270 million Series-E funding round from an unnamed group of investors. The company is now believed to have a valuation of around $2.5 billion. Supported by the new investment, the company is gearing up to build a national knowledge content platform, increasing investment in artificial intelligence technologies, content ecology, knowledge services and commercialization. ""We are looking to build a smart community for the general public users, with AI and user generated content at the core,"" Zhou said. According to him, AI and big data technologies will help recommend to users the topics they have interests in, better match suitable answers with the questions as well as identify harmful information and behavior in the community. Andrew Malcolm, chief marketing officer at Silicon-based information organization application Evernote, said there has been a growth in the trend of gaining access to valuable information and the willingness to pay for it in China, which is hardly seen in other countries. ""Knowledge economy has huge potential, driven by the cultural thirst for ongoing improvement, like self-improvement and learning. The acceptance or encouragement of micro transactions around knowledge and content is really pushing everybody to realize that money can be made from content,"" said Malcolm."
1,"This year World Book Day lands on April 23. To those faithful book lovers, publishing houses are an important element to consider when purchasing books. China has many distinguished publishing companies, and here arefive famous for their books and national influence. Originally based in Shanghai, Zhonghua Book Company was established in 1912 and moved to Beijing in 1954. As early as 1937, the company has had 1,000 employees. It specializes in publishing ancient books and classics, such as 13 important Buddhist texts.,  SDX is the abbreviation of the names of three companies established in the 1930s in Shanghai: Shenghuo Book Store, Dushu Press and Xinzhi Book Store. After 1945, the three joined forces and SDX Joint Publishing Company was created in Hong Kong. In March of 1949, the publishing house moved to Beijing. It has published many works by Chinese intellectuals for over half a century.,  The publishing house was established in 1951 in Beijing. Writer Zheng Xuefeng was the first general director and chief editor. It aims to publish distinguished Chinese and foreign literature classics.,  In 1988, YiLin Press was established based on an editorial department of the journal  . It mainly publishes popular literature from foreign countries.,   Established in Shanghai in 1897, The Commercial Press moved its headquarters to Beijing in 1954. The publishing house is well-known for its dictionaries. China's first modern lexicographical work  was published by The Commercial Press."

Phoenix Satellite Television Global Brand Summit, an annual event which recently held its latest meeting in Beijing on Nov 8, has gathered the Hong Kong broadcaster's top hosts, business leaders, international organization representatives and scholars to seek the answer. Dong Jiayao, vice-president of Phoenix and a renowned anchor known for the popular commenting program says the media outlet has more than 100 journalists in around 60 countries and regions. Their connection with local authorities and commercial circles can help Chinese enterprises be more quickly recognized, Dong said. Sally Wu, deputy head of Phoenix InfoNews Channel and a veteran presenter, suggested Chinese companies be open and inclusive when going abroad. Earlier this year a record 120 Chinese companies moved onto the Fortune Global 500 list, marking the 15th consecutive year the country's companies have increased their presence there. China is facing an unprecedented opportunity to go abroad and its rich media resources could be very useful to expand Chinese enterprises' influence overseas, said Tian Tao, a Beijing-based researcher."
0,"Editor's note: This is the last story in a series reflecting China's achievements in a range of fields, including science, law enforcement, education and transportation, resulting from 40 years of the reform and opening-up policy. Surrounded by obsolete objects, Song Zhenzhong, a small man in a red traditional jacket, excitedly explained how to operate the ""antiques"" to a group of primary school students. That was in October, when Song held an exhibition of outdated objects at a library in Beijing's Dongcheng district. Daily necessities marking changes in China, ranging from rice coupons to black-and-white televisions, were displayed to illustrate the advances that have occurred in the past 40 years. For older observers, the objects brought back memories, while the younger ones enjoyed an eye-opening glimpse of the past. Song's event was one of several he has held this year to mark the 40th anniversary of the reform and opening-up policy. The 55-year-old is a sixth-generation descendant of the Manchu Eight Banners, an administrative division of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), in Beijing. His parents made a living by dipping strings of candied haws in sugar and selling them on the streets. Having learned the tricks of the trade, Song helped his parents in their work and excelled at peddling the candies. He started collecting curios as a hobby at age 13, and now owns four museums that contain items such as bronze mirrors and headwear dating from the Qin Dynasty (221-206 BC) to the Qing. The exhibition in October, which centered on objects related to people's daily lives, was one of more than 10 events he has held this year to display his vast collection. ""It's meaningless to deliver lectures via computers because it is not perceptual at all. These outmoded objects, which appeared after the 1970s, are just a small part of my collection. As someone who grew up in a traditional Beijing alleyway, I want to make a contribution to traditional culture and leave something for my descendants,"" he said. The internet has made it easy for collectors to obtain discarded former necessities.,In the days when China operated a planned economy, people used a variety of coupons to obtain everything from food to appliances. Food coupons were among the first batch of negotiable securities issued by the government. From the 1950s to the '80s, a period of severe shortages, the coupons ensured that every family received its fair allocation of food. ""My grandfather and I waited in line to buy rice coupons on the 24th of each month with the salary my mom got the same day. We had to allocate the rice carefully or we wouldn't have enough to eat,"" said Wang Yuxia, a 60-something who grew up in Beijing. ""The monthly supply was recorded in a notebook that showed the amount of rice and oil each family bought. Four of us ate 59 kilograms a month,"" she added, noting that the entries end in June 1993. As living standards improved - the per capita disposable income of urban residents rose to 25,974 yuan ($3,770) last year from 171 yuan in 1978 - rice coupons gradually disappeared from daily life. ""Cash replacing coupons as a form of payment was not a sudden change but a gradual process. I remember using rice coupons and cash together to buy food,"" Wang said. ""Now we buy goods via mobile payment. I can buy groceries without taking cash with me when I walk around after dinner. It's far more convenient than using rice coupons."" A recent report from the National Bureau of Statistics shows that China's Engel coefficient, a measure of food expenditure as a proportion of total household spending, fell to 29.3 percent last year, nearly 35 percent lower than in 1978, indicating the rise in living standards.,Four decades of reform and opening-up have seen higher living standards and helped China to become the world's second-largest economy. The NBS said GDP has risen from 370 billion yuan in 1978 to almost 83 trillion yuan last year. According to people.cn, the annual growth rate was 14.5 percent, and last year, China accounted for 16 percent of the global economy, compared with 1.8 percent in 1978. Li Yan, a 45-year-old consultant in the field of information and communications technology in Beijing, was among the visitors at Song's exhibition. ""Foreign products flowing into the country had a huge impact - boosting innovation, both in products and ideas,"" she said. Reflecting on the most impressive change for her in the past 40 years, Li plumped for the improvement in the transportation network. ""Back in my school days, we used student tickets when we took a bus to school, but they only arrived every 30 minutes in the morning. The infrequent, crowded buses made attending school very difficult,"" she said. During the past four decades, transportation payment systems were upgraded from paper tickets to travel cards, and today smartphone apps provide convenience when using public transportation. Public vehicles have improved, too. Last year, Beijing Public Transport owned and operated 26,363 public vehicles, compared with 3,315 in 1978. Moreover, 739 routes have been added to the 119 that operated in 1978. Li said that when she first visited Europe 20 years ago, she was shocked by the advanced subway and high-speed rail networks. ""However, I recently returned from a business trip to Italy. My assistant asked me not to tease her about their subway systems. She was worried that people from China would find the networks old-fashioned because China's rate of development is much faster,"" she said. Visitors to Song's exhibition stopped to view items that caught their eye, especially those connected to their younger selves. A dusty abacus in a corner attracted the attention of accountant Yin Mingxian. Though computers and mobile phones are universally popular nowadays, the simple counting frame invented during the Song Dynasty (960-1279) is still used because of its accuracy and convenience. ""When I started my first job in the 1990s, we had had calculators, but I still used an abacus because I regarded it as much more accurate,"" she said, with a laugh. ""Veteran accountants preferred the old-fashioned abacus in particular. Today all companies use computers to do their accounts."",The Chinese abacus, zhusuan, was listed as an intangible cultural heritage at the eighth annual UNESCO World Heritage Congress in 2013. Yin's son, who was born in 1995, showed little interest in his mother's work items, but he could not take his eyes off several tape recorders. ""We listened to tapes in English class, like all children at the time,"" he said. His peer, Li Yimeng, a 20-something who has just gained a master's, has a special feeling for tapes and recorders: ""The tapes matched my Chinese and English textbooks, and I listened to them every day during middle school."" In 1963, the role of tapes was expanded from data storage to playing music, and they were later replaced by MP3, MP4 and mobile phones. ""I can recall the lyrics and text shining on the screen of the MP3 and MP4 players as I listened to music and read stories from textbooks,"" Li Yimeng recalled. ""Now, all you need is a smartphone, which gives everyone access to learning materials anywhere. People don't have to sift through tapes and play them in order, which saves time. As technology progressed rapidly, tape recorders faded out of our lives,"" she said. During the exhibition's opening ceremony, visitors were each given a string of candied haws made by Song to revive a favorite childhood taste. However, he wasn't trying to show off his skills by filling the room with fragrant smells and sweet flavors. Instead, he simply wanted to attract more children to the event so they could see the redundant items. ""I don't feel privileged about my family background, and I have never thought of making a fortune from my collection. I love traditional culture and my original inspiration was to spread it by collecting as many old-fashioned objects as possible and showing them to people to illustrate the country's rich culture,"" he said."
0,"An increasing number of bookstores with a variety of services supported by the Beijing municipal government has attracted more readers back to physical books. According to a survey covering residents ages from 7 to 70 in the 16 districts of the capital, interest in reading such books has grown. From 2013 to last year, spending by Beijing residents on books rose from 85 yuan to 330 yuan ($12 to $48) annually per person on average. In the past year, Chinese read 7.86 books per person on average, combining both physical and electronic ones, while those living in Beijing read 10.97 physical books, according to the survey, which was conducted by the municipal government, agencies and industry experts. About 65 percent of Beijing residents bought books in bookstores last year, up by 3 percent year-on-year. People in the capital read physical books for 21 minutes and digital books for 44 minutes a day on average, while nationwide they spend a total of 46 minutes a day reading both types. The growing enthusiasm for reading in the city is closely related to the increasing variety of bookstores. PageOne Bookstore in Dashilar, Xicheng district, has become a popular venue because of its helpful service and variety of activities related to reading. Covering 3,000 square meters, the store has 35,000 Chinese-language books and 25,000 foreign-language ones. Cultural and creative products are displayed in different areas of the shop. Liu Gang, the general manager, said: ""Readers' demands have changed ... They don't just need books－it's important that we create a cultural place and an enjoyable atmosphere to attract them to reading."" The store boasts a writers' salon, games and night concerts, which have attracted many people. It is open round-the-clock and has invited customers to experience reading at night by providing tents and creating a comfortable area for them to share views on poems and literature. Liu said the store is not just a book retailer. The games and lectures held there are also necessary to attract readers. More niche reading areas are planned for Xicheng, such as public libraries and bookstores. For instance, the Honglou movie theater, which has not been used for years, will be transformed into a public library where people can bring their books for others to borrow. The municipal government provided financial support to help 40 bookstores that had been running at a loss to realize a profit last year, while profits at 23 stores rose year-on-year. The government also has been encouraging publishers and large bookstores to cooperate on providing innovative reading environments and facilities."
0,"For two days in a row recently, Peking Opera master Du Jinfang used a hearing aid to listen to speeches about the struggling art form at the ongoing 7th Beijing International Film Festival. After the speeches, the 85-year-old artist was a bit tired, but she was excited about the progress made by the Peking Opera Film Project, which brings together top opera companies and movie studios to convert classic shows into feature-length movies. ""I began to learn the opera as a 6-year-old, and took leads at 16. But most of the performers nowadays are in their 30s. We are short of replacements,"" she says. ""But thanks to the project, young performers will be encouraged and the opera will be revived,"" she adds. Since 2011, the project has led to the production of 10 movies, such as     and  . And six of them have been screened at international film festivals, bagging 13 awards.,  The project envisages the production of another 10 such movies in the next three years. From the six award winners,  －a 2,200-year-ago romance about a hero and his lover－has been screened in the United States, Japan, Britain, New Zealand and Australia, and will be screened in more foreign countries in the next few months. Opera buffs in Beijing will also get a chance to savor the classics. As part of the Beijing film festival's Peking Opera section, all the movies are being screened in three cinemas in Beijing's Chaoyang district. The opera movies will be screened in the mornings for free in these theaters for the rest of this year, according to the festival organizers. With this new initiative, the total number of screenings could hit 500. Celebrities, critics and filmmakers see the project－the largest of its kind in New China's history－as a new chapter for the art form, which goes back more than 200 years.,  Li Enjie, head of the Jingju Theater Company of Beijing, says Peking Opera dates back to 1790 when troupes from Anhui province brought the opera to Beijing to mark the birthday of then-emperor Qianlong, a turning point for the art form. Interestingly, the links between Peking Opera and cinema go back to 1905, when the first Chinese movie   was made. The 30-minute movie, based on the 14th-century novel  was a recording of an opera show performed by then-celebrity artist Tan Xinpei. Movies based on Peking Opera featuring top performers were box-office hits in the 1930s and 1940s, and hit a new high in the 1960s and 1970s with the so-called yangbanxi (revolutionary model dramas). However, as pop culture took hold, the following for traditional opera died. But Li believes cinema can help Peking Opera regain its popularity, a view shared by others.,  Liu Changyu, a famous Peking Opera artist, says: ""The big screen can highlight facial expressions, gestures and relevant details to give the audience a clearer view of the performance. ""Also, as seats in traditional theaters are limited, the cinematic versions can overcome the limitations of time and space, and give classic performances immortality. ""So, even though the artists pass away, the essence of their performances can be preserved."" Echoing her words, Ma Chongjie, director of the Peking Opera films   and  says such movies are a treasure for future generations.  is about a female official from the Tang Dynasty (618-907) who serves the Empress Wu Zetian, while   is an unlikely story about revenge. Focusing on the challenges faced in making such movies, Ma says: ""The main issues for the crews are how to shoot such a film and what content to keep out."",  Typically, most of the classic shows, selected by a 21-consultant team run for around three hours on stage, but a movie usually lasts for around two hours. Ma says a Peking Opera movie director has to be familiar with music, characters and drama structure to make the correct cuts. Praising the ongoing Peking Opera Film Project, Cui Wei, the secretary-general of China Theater Association, says while in the past, such movies were produced by just one theater company and one studio, the State-backed effort has led to the teaming up of top talent, with most of the movies boasting an all-celebrity cast. ""Audiences can now see performances from different schools (of Peking Opera) in one movie,"" says Cui. Wang Xiaoxin, a veteran scriptwriter and researcher, says Peking Opera films will also appeal to foreign audiences."

In a survey rolled out by the country's largest online travel agency Ctrip, about 15 percent of those booking breaks last year appeared to be single, an increase of 10.4 percent compared to 2015. Up to 41 percent of those choosing to travel alone were between the ages of 19 and 30, and were mostly unmarried, although Ctrip did not disclose detailed figures. ""Traveling by yourself these days seems to be a way of pursuing a kind of spirituality,"" said Shi Yuzhuan, chief marketing officer of Ctrip's tourism division. ""It is extremely popular among young people nowadays."" Online outlets have enabled more individuals to travel alone. Booking air tickets, hotel rooms and visits to scenic spots can be done with a click or two. If single consumers need help, they can always call a travel consultant on their smartphone. ""People no longer feel helpless when traveling by themselves,"" Shi said. According to the Ctrip survey released earlier this year, singles from major cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu and Shenzhen, are more than happy to travel alone. In terms of destinations, Lijiang and Kunming in Yunnan province, and Jiuzhaigou in Sichuan province are the most popular domestic routes. Seoul, Hong Kong and Bangkok top the list for overseas trips. Of those traveling alone, up to 58 percent were women. Zhao Lei is a marketing manager at a multinational beverage company in Shanghai and takes at least five trips each year. With disposable income to play with, she mostly travels to overseas destinations. ""I have no plans of saving for marriage,"" the 36-year-old said. ""If getting married will affect my travel plans, I would rather remain single."" When asked about the reasons for traveling alone, most of those interviewed by Ctrip said they enjoyed the freedom of heading off by themselves. Meeting new friends and even starting a relationship also appealed to them. Li Kai is a programmer at an internet company in Beijing and prefers traveling alone than going with friends. This gives him the chance to meet more people during his trips. ""My life is already quite mundane,"" the 27-year-old said. ""I look at codes all day and my circle is very small. ""I prefer to travel on my own so that I can make new friends,"" Li added. ""These trips are also more challenging."" Ctrip's survey found that 98 percent of people traveling on their own were satisfied with the experience. This was a far higher rate than those taking off with friends or family. ""That is partly because the travel packages in the market are more suitable to singles than to families or friends,"" said Liu Deqian, a tourism researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences."

During the campaign, which will run until August, health authorities will focus on cleaning public places to remove excessive water and prevent mosquitoes from breeding, Liu Zejun, a member of the commission in charge of disease control and prevention in the city, said at a news conference. Health authorities will mobilize the public to remove pools of water from places such as public restrooms, residential areas, parks, construction sites and garbage recycling stations, he said. Other steps to control mosquitoes include releasing mosquito-eating fish in lakes and ponds and applying pesticides in areas where removing water is difficult, such as underground sewage systems, he said. The Beijing Municipal Commission of Health and Family Planning has trained 16 professional mosquito elimination teams to help with the work, he said. Studies by disease control and prevention experts have found that the density of Aedes albopictus, a kind of mosquito that is the major medium for transmission of dengue fever, has been increasing in Beijing for several years, said Zeng Xiaopeng, deputy director of the Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control. In 2013, they accounted for 3.5 percent of all mosquitoes in Beijing, but the proportion rose to 14 percent last year. That means a higher risk of dengue fever, which can cause death in serious cases, he said. Dengue fever outbreaks have occurred in some areas of South China, but sporadic imported cases have been spotted in recent years in northern areas, including Beijing, due to the spread of the virus, Zeng said. Mosquitoes become more active with rising temperatures, and their density peaks in July and August in Beijing, he said. Health authorities are prepared for outbreaks of infectious diseases including dengue fever, and emergency plans are ready, he said."

And it is reflected today in his high-profile international engagements and in the orchestra's impressive tour schedule, including its debut at last year's Lucerne Summer Festival. ""The recordings will help draw global attention to the outstanding musicianship of Long Yu and the SSO, and foster the already significant profile of DG in China."",Fedina Zhou Ping, the president of SSO says that DG and Yu started to discuss the partnership in early 2017. And they appreciate Yu's critically acclaimed work as music director of the SSO as well as his active engagement in classical music in both China and the world. ""Maestro Yu has worked with the SSO for a decade, and always promotes the orchestra's powerful blend of tradition and ambition,"" she says. ""Under his direction, the SSO has become one of the most vibrant arts organizations in the region. And Maestro Yu has designed professional seasons, introduced world-class musicians to the SSO, created the Music in the Summer Air Festival and the Shanghai Orchestra Academy with the New York Philharmoinc Orchestra, and has lifted the SSO to a world standard."" As for Yu, he says he is thrilled to be associated with the yellow label. ""It's not only a great honor to me and the SSO, but a recognition of China's classical music development. ""China is not only the second largest economy in the world, but its culture also has a great impact globally. ""So, we are determined to reach out to music lovers across the world, and will now be able to connect with new listeners through our recordings for the yellow label. ""I look forward to recording works by Chinese composers and sharing these and the wonderful artistry that the SSO brings to the great symphony repertoire with international audiences."",Composer Chen Qigang, whose work will feature on the first album, says: ""It's easy to see the honor, but not the hard work and painstaking efforts behind the achievement. Thanks to Yu for choosing my work for the first DG album."" Congratulations also came from other composers and musicians. Chinese composer Guo Wenjing says: ""DG's contract is a big deal. The yellow label is a dream for musicians and orchestras."" Tu Song, a clarinetist and the Beijing Music Festival's program director, says: ""Although people now mostly listen to digital music, most classic music is still recorded on albums."" ""DG's contract with Yu and the SSO represents a recognition and encouragement for Chinese musicians and orchestras."" Yu's links with the SSO go back to 2009. Besides, he founded the China Philharmonic Orchestra in 2000, and has been its music director since. Yu is also the music director of the Guangzhou Symphony Orchestra that he joined in 2003. And he has also devoted a lot of effort to the development of both orchestras. Explaining why he decided to link the SSO with DG, he says that the SSO is the oldest orchestra in China, and possibly Asia, going back more than 150 years, and that in the last few decades, it has made a mark on the world classical music scene.,Shanghai opened to the Western world in 1843 and since that time, foreign cultures have integrated with Chinese culture through this commercial port. The first Western music performers made a mark on the mainland in 1879 when a group of foreign musicians formed the Shanghai Public Band. Then, a few years later, Italian pianist Mario Paci built up the orchestra to more than 50 players, including some Chinese musicians. Arrigo Foa then took over the baton from Paci in 1942. And Chinese musician Huang Yijun became the first Chinese conductor after new China was founded in 1949. The orchestra became formally known as the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra in 1956. As for Yu, he was born into a musical family in Shanghai in 1964, and then studied at the Shanghai Conservatory followed by Berlin's Hochschule de Kunste. His time in Germany was influential in many ways. And speaking about his time there, he says: ""It was in Berlin that I learned the most important things about life, not just from my music studies but from the city's incredible culture scene as a whole."" Later, upon his return to China in the early 1990s, he began working with the country's leading orchestras. He then founded the Beijing Music Festival in 1998 and China Philharmonic Orchestra in 2000. He is also the principal guest conductor with the Hong Kong Philhamonic Orchestra. His guest-conducting work includes collaborations with the New York Philharmonic, the Philharmonia Orchestra, the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, the Tonhalle-Orchester Zurich, the NDR Elbphilharmonie Orchester, the WDR Sinfonieorchester Koln, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and the Orchestra dell'Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia."
0,"Slovenian physicist Rudolf Podgornik said he had some initial doubts about his decision to take a position in China when he first arrived in Beijing in November. ""When I was growing up, we didn't hear much about China,"" he said. ""The first time I remember hearing about China was an interview of Zhou Enlai I saw on television years ago. Everybody was around Zhou, and one question I remember was, 'What do you think of the French Revolution, which took place in the 1790s?' ""Zhou thought for a while and replied by saying that it was too early to say."" The 63-year-old physicist could not help but beam when he recalled the exchange. ""What a great answer,"" he said. When Podgornik visited Nankai University in Tianjin in January, he seized on the opportunity to take a picture with a statue of Zhou Enlai on campus. Podgornik also likes to read books on Chinese philosophy by Zhuangzi and Laozi to form a basic understanding of the country's culture and the way the people think. For most of his professional life, Podgornik taught and conducted research in Slovenia's capital, Ljubljana, as well as in the United States, specializing in soft matter and biophysics. ""One of my Chinese doctoral students in the United States introduced China's Thousand Talents Plan to me when I was a few years from retirement,"" he said. ""I thought it would be interesting to do something different through this program."" In April, Podgornik was officially recruited as a foreign expert to work at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing. He now leads a laboratory manned by a small group of PhD students at the university's School of Physical Sciences. As the only foreigner at the school, Podgornik said he found it difficult at the beginning to adapt to a different environment. ""I think Chinese culture puts a lot of weight on a professor's authority. There is a big gap between professors and students, and students tend to follow educators without question,"" he said. When Podgornik occasionally encounters culture differences like these, a famous compatriot from ages past motivates him to keep moving forward. ""I was born in the same town as Ferdinand Hallerstein, a foreign missionary to China who worked for the Chinese government for more than 30 years,"" he said. The missionary - known as Liu Songling in China - was born in Ljubljana, and traveled to China in the 18th century during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). In addition to his religious duties, Hallerstein was appointed head of the astronomical observatory, and oversaw the creation of an armillary sphere with rotating rings that is still on display in the Beijing Ancient Observatory. Podgornik said he also hopes to bring something new to China with his rich knowledge in the world of physics. ""I hope that I can contribute to the development of science in China,"" he said. ""My dream would be to establish biophysics as a separate subject at the university."" Biophysics is the application of physical principles to the study of viruses, and Podgornik said he feels that China is not strong in this field right now. ""I want to be part of the force that makes China stronger in science,"" he said. As his initial skepticism has gradually faded away, Podgornik is settling down in Beijing. He has bought an electric bike, and delights in riding it about town. ""I am satisfied with everything so far, and I am excited to expand my work and enjoy my new adventure in China,"" he said."
1,"The 144-hour visa-free entry policy - for nationals with eligible travel identification and reserved tickets from 53 countries - is already producing strongly positive results. Bookings of tickets to scenic spots in Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei have grown by 30 percent since the policy was launched on Dec 28, China's biggest online travel agency Ctrip reported. In addition, bookings for surrounding hotels have also witnessed more than 20 percent in growth since the initiative was rolled out. ""The move will significantly benefit the tourism industry, especially because Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei abound in tourism resources,"" said Peng Liang, director of Ctrip's public relations department. The Beijing Municipal Commission of Tourism Development is already working on new and improved tourism products with major travel operators, including Ctrip, the China Youth Travel Service and Beijing Caissa International Travel Service Co. The products will cover among other things cultural heritage, traditional Chinese medicine, meetings, conventions and exhibitions across the three regions, according to the Beijing tourism commission.,Ctrip has responded to the change with the launch of a sixday tour of Beijing and Hebei's Chengde. Airport pickup and delivery services are also available. As a result, visitors will be able to take in all the major landmarks and tourism hot spots - including Tiananmen Square, the Badaling section of the Great Wall, the Bird's Nest stadium and Chengde Mountain Resort. China International Travel Service has also rolled out more than 20 products for international travelers eligible for the new policy. Arrangements have been made for Russian travelers to observe traditional Chinese medicine, while visits to hutong and paper-cutting events have been prepared for visitors from North America, according to the Beijing-based travel service company. Some products will feature different themes on a daily basis. The company said these would include watching art performances at the National Center for the Performing Arts, learning traditional arts or dining at distinctive restaurants. ""The previous 72-hour policy allowed visitors to experience major scenic spots, while the 144-hour will make experiencing the Chinese lifestyle possible,"" said Wu Zheng, general manager of the destination promotion center with the China International Travel Service's head office. The policy will save tourists a considerable amount of money that was previously needed for the visa application process, Wu said. He added that there had been a strongly positive response to the company's products after the change in policy. ""We hope international tourists have more opportunities to enjoy an in-depth tour of Chinese culture,"" he said. The tourism website Aoyou, operated by the China Youth Travel Service, has launched a one-day card that offers access to 158 scenic spots across the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area. Products targeting the new policy, like a four-day tour of Beijing, are also available on Aoyou. ""The products take into account the time inbound tourists need to check into a hotel, get over their jet lag and adapt to the new environment,"" said Xu Xiaolei, chief brand officer for China Youth Travel Service. Foreign language services could also be offered, based on specific customer needs, Xu added. At the same time, Beijing Capital International Airport is trying to cooperate with well-known domestic travel service providers to come up with tailored trips ranging from one to six days. ""The airport can keep luggage for those travelers for 144 hours for free,"" said Meng Xianwei, general manager of the aviation business department of the airport. Temporary entry points and tag systems were added to Beijing airport's Terminal 2 and 3 to make things easier for inbound tourists. Air China International Corp said it would offer information about relevant connecting flights and discounted tickets for travelers."
1,"Sixteen years ago, leaving his home village of Sanyizhai in Central China's Henan province for coastal cities was the only way Sun Ming could realize his dream－to earn enough money to build a two-story house back home, where he could get married and support his agricultural family. But it is no longer the only way. ""The monthly salary in Lankao at the turn of the century was around 150 yuan ($21), whereas workers in coastal factories could earn 10 times as much,"" said the 32-year-old, who now runs a plant nursery in Sanyizhai, in the west of Lankao county. ""The net revenue from my nursery last year alone reached 200,000 yuan,"" he laughed, adding it was just the amount needed to build a two-story house. Sun is among some 30,000 migrant workers from Lankao who have returned home over the last decade, with enough skills and capital accumulated over the years to start lucrative businesses at their doorsteps, according to the county's human resources and social security bureau. The returning tide of talent and capital created 96,000 local jobs, giving people more job alternatives within the county, the bureau said. China's reform and opening-up, which began in 1978, has triggered rapid urbanization in coastal regions and, as a result, massive numbers of farmers from impoverished Central and West China have flowed southeast to feed the hunger for construction workers there. With a population of almost 100 million, Henan has since become a major exporter of labor. The draining away of younger workers seriously impacted a number of impoverished counties, such as Lankao, that remained on the national list of poverty-stricken counties until last year. In 2002, Sun finished middle school at age 16, and going to high school was a luxury he could not afford. He first tried his luck in an electronics factory and then a cotton mill in the southern city of Guangzhou, Guangdong province, and later worked for a flower wholesale market in Shanghai, where he married and had a son. ""I could earn up to 20,000 yuan a month when I worked extra hours on weekends, but the cost of a thrifty life was high as well,"" he said. Despite higher salaries in the cities, many migrant workers find it hard to blend into urban society. The strict hukou, or household registration system, has increased the cost of being an outsider in cities by limiting access to schooling and healthcare. And the inadequate protection of their labor rights has left them prone to poor working conditions and payment defaults. The 2008 financial crisis also dealt a heavy blow to coastal factories, and an estimated 3 million migrant workers from Henan were forced back to their hometowns. Though Sun didn't return home immediately, he was impressed with the changes in his hometown every time he came back for the Spring Festival holiday. The new high-speed railway station, the increasingly mature road network and the growing demand for ornamental plants for street decoration appealed to him.,In 2016, Sun decided to move back with the 600,000 yuan he had saved, along with his knowledge about flower nurseries and the market. He was also able to get an interest-free loan of 300,000 yuan from the local government－an amount that would be hard to get from commercial banks. ""Running my own business is much more energy consuming than working for others, but I have great expectations for the future,"" he said. Zhu Huasheng, a professor of economic geography at Beijing Normal University, said the number of returnees began to increase in 2000, and the central government had called for policy support for the trend for six consecutive years in its ""No 1 central document""－the outline of policy priorities for the year－starting from 2007. ""Coastal regions now aspire for industrial upgrading and therefore have higher requirements for their labor force,"" he said. ""In the meantime, their hometowns have gotten increasingly attractive, with more job opportunities and lower living costs."" Local officials in Lankao estimate that local incomes have been increasing at an annual rate of about 12 percent over the last few years, and companies including Foxconn and Evergrande Group have set up a number of factories in the county. In addition to the rising number of well-paid local jobs, Shi Tianyou, director of the county's human resources and social security bureau, said improved infrastructure has also helped boost local business opportunities. Shi hailed the influx of talent like Sun, saying he knows too well the social problems left by the exodus of young people. ""The elderly and the toddlers were left behind to take care of one another,"" he said. ""The absence of a working population posed a great challenge to local urbanization and rural revitalization."" China has pledged to eradicate poverty domestically by the end of 2020. The five-year period since 2012 has seen two-thirds of the country's impoverished population lifted out of their situation. But there are still some 30 million Chinese living in dire poverty－most of them scattered across the country's vast rural areas. Last year, the central leadership put forward a rural revitalization strategy at the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. Early this year, the central government again prioritized rural affairs in its ""No 1 central document"" for the year. Zhu, the economic geography professor, said the influx of farmer entrepreneurs is helping accelerate urbanization in Lankao, and contributing to the division of labor between urban and rural areas. ""In addition to creating local jobs, the returnees bring back new ideas and business models, which instill life into the local economy,"" he said. To facilitate the trend, the Lankao government has lowered the threshold for loans for those who start local businesses, and it organizes regular entrepreneurial tutorials where the returnees can share experiences and information. According to the local human resources and social security bureau, some 1,500 loans amounting to 170 million yuan were handed out to startups last year, benefiting some 6,800 returnees who created another 21,000 local jobs. Shi, head of the bureau, said his office also works with experts to develop business projects suitable for migrant workers that are tailored to local resource advantages. Zhu said government should avoid levying too many taxes as startups grow bigger. ""I know cases where startups are first given loads of favorable policies, but as they grow, they become the target of local tax authorities,"" he said. The professor also said less-developed regions in Central and West China should strengthen institutional reform and reduce administrative costs to attract industries and migrant workers back from the east."
0,"Crucial work has been done to safeguard China's cultural treasures, and more responsibilities are being placed on the government's shoulders, a senior official said on Tuesday. ""More efforts will be made to hold officials accountable (when accidents happen),"" Luo Shugang, minister of culture, said in Beijing during the two sessions. Last year, a pair of stone candelabra found in a Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) emperor's tomb was stolen in Beijing, but local officials covered up the theft for months. After the artifacts were traced, 17 administrators, including six department heads, were disciplined for the incident. Twelve officials in Hebei province were also held responsible in 2016 after an illegal real estate development was started near the Eastern Qing Tombs, which date back to the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). Both locations are part of the Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties, an inscribed UNESCO World Heritage site. Fires resulting in damage to six key cultural heritage sites under State protection also led to 23 officials receiving punishments in 2017, according to culture authorities. Luo said China recently established an accountability system to clarify who is responsible for protecting each of the country's 767,000 registered ""unmovable"" cultural heritage sites, such as structures and monuments. China has prevented several major crimes involving cultural relics, Luo said. For example, he said, the Ministry of Public Security released most-wanted lists twice last year specifically to strike at such crimes. It led to the capture of 16 of the 20 suspects in the list. ""Protection of cultural relics has many more legal references now,"" the minister said. However, to implement the laws that safeguard cultural relics, it is essential to conduct an archaeological investigation before any major infrastructure construction begins, he added. Luo said having a clear understanding of cultural resources is one way to better protect the nation's heritage. Consequently, the Culture Ministry has organized several nationwide surveys in the past five years. The surveys found that 108 million cultural relics are housed in public museums and other State-owned institutions. More than 870,000 intangible cultural heritage items were also registered, Luo said. He called for better protection of intangible cultural heritage, and said it should be promoted among the public in creative ways to enrich people's cultural lives. Luo cited the third season of A Bite of China, which was broadcast recently by China Central Television, as a show that promotes culinary culture. A type of iron pan made through traditional craftsmanship sold out almost immediately after being featured in one episode of the latest season. ""We need more ways to keep such heritage items alive and let them improve people's livelihoods,"" Luo said."
1,"The China headquarters of Japan's Orix Corporation is not in Beijing or Shanghai but in Dalian, a coastal city in China's northeastern Liaoning province. ""It was the Summer Davos that promoted the cooperation,"" said Lawrence Lin, managing director of Orix (China) Investment Co Ltd. On the basis of effective communications among decision makers, Orix Corp, which boasts more than 2,000 outlets in 36 countries and regions around the world, set up its China branch in the province in December 2009. ""We see great opportunity in China's rapid development,"" Lin commented. Other reasons Orix chose the city were the trustworthiness of its officials, Dalian's stable development, as well as the similar geological environment and cultural background. Soon after its establishment, Orix China became the first institutional investor in Dalian Haichang Group. It is helping introduce capital, both from home and abroad, to boost Haichang's push for nationwide expansion. Haichang Ocean Park Holdings Ltd was listed in Hong Kong in 2013 and became China's biggest ocean park operator and one of the top 10 in the world. The 2017 Summer Davos, or the Annual Meeting of the New Champions, is being held from June 27 to 29 in Dalian. Taking advantage of the event, Dalian, which has alternately hosted the event with Tianjin since 2007, has attracted more foreign investment. ""It opens a window for the world to know Dalian and vice versa,"" said Li Heming, an official with Dalian Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Bureau. During the 2017 Summer Davos, Dalian signed contracts with 25 companies from home and abroad. The investment of 17 foreign projects totaled $2.16 billion and the investment of eight domestic-funded projects reached 14.2 billion yuan ($2.09). During the 2015 Summer Davos, Dalian signed cooperative agreements with some corporate participants in the forum. The total investments of all the 13 projects totaled $8.14 billion. By now, two third of the projects have been successfully implemented, including those initiated by Goodyear, Pfizer and Orix, Li said. More than 1,500 politicians, officials, entrepreneurs, scholars, and media representatives from over 90 countries and regions are attending the annual meeting. ""It is a big chance for Dalian to obtain true international exposure and show our investment opportunities,"" she said. Dalian is the most concentrated area of foreign trade and foreign investments in northeastern China. Statistics from the Dalian Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Bureau show that currently investors from more than 80 countries and regions have set up 18,600 companies with accumulated foreign capital of over $100 billion in Dalian."
1,"The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei integrated development plan, a part of China's national strategies, has achieved tangible results since its inception five years ago and helped the government to redistribute resources and industries in the capital to nearby regions for better growth, a senior official said. ""For environmental improvement, transportation and industrial cooperation, we have achieved rapid growth in the past years under the guidance of the integrated development plan,"" said Liu Bozheng, deputy head of the Beijing coordinated development office, at a conference in Tongzhou, where Beijing's municipal government and other agencies sitting in a sub-city complex are located. President Xi Jinping called for the integrated and coordinated development of Beijing and the two neighboring areas during a symposium on Feb 26, 2014. On April 30, 2015, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei integrated development plan was approved, making it clear that the region will be built into a world-class city cluster with the capital as the core. The three local governments have been working together since then on environmental protection including afforestation and combating air pollution. In the past five years, Beijing and Hebei have built forests with a total area of 333 square kilometers and the capital's PM 2.5 levels, a measure of air pollution alerts, dipped to a record low last year. The development plan had urged the construction of a mature transportation network in the region. Since then, it takes just one hour for rail travel between Beijing, Tianjin and Baoding in Hebei. The Beijing Daxing International Airport, which is expected to become North China's air travel hub, is situated on the border of Beijing and Langfang, Hebei. The new airport, scheduled to be put into use later this year, will help to improve the efficiency of the airports' resources in Tianjin and Shijiazhuang, capital of Hebei. The new airport's completion will help to boost the development of the four strategic areas in the region - like the Beijing New Airport Economic Zone. According to the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Integrated Development Office, the other three are the Caofeidian Integrated Development Zone in Hebei, Tianjin Binhai New Area and the Zhangjiakou-Chengde Ecological Area, also in Hebei. These zones will help boost economic growth in the region, and the three governments have carried out a series of cooperation projects in the past five years. For instance, Beijing's Zhongguancun group has invested heavily in Tianjin in science and technology. Some high-end projects of Beijing companies such as automobile manufacturing have been shifted to Hebei. According to data from the office, Beijing has invested 700 billion yuan ($105 billion) in Tianjin and Hebei for key industrial projects between 2015 and 2018. Between Jan 16 and 18 this year, Xi inspected Tianjin and other cities in Hebei province and took stock of the reports on the integrated development in the region. Xi also visited Beijing's sub-city center in Tongzhou on Jan 18 after the Beijing municipal government moved to the new administration buildings in the district. Shi Jianxun, an economist with Tongji University said the integrated development of this region has entered a new phase. He said regional development will get new impetus, especially as the sub-city center will be key to Beijing in the new era. Tianjin, a port city with a population of 14 million, and Hebei, a traditional industrial and transportation hub, will embrace their new development chances during the capital's resources and industries' redistribution, he said."
1,"The Beijing Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China has condemned and punished executives of Tong Ren Tang, a famous maker of traditional Chinese medicine, after it was found to be selling expired honey, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection said on Tuesday. Jiangsu TV reported in mid-December that a honey provider for Beijing Tong Ren Tang Bee Industry－a subsidiary of the Chinese herbal medicine brand founded in 1669－had been accused of reusing expired honey in production in Yancheng, Jiangsu province. An investigation was launched by the company. Because the company is registered in Beijing, the capital's discipline inspection commission began an investigation last month to apportion responsibility. The investigation found that the Party committee of the company failed to supervise its subsidiaries, resulting in chaotic internal management and severe loss of State-owned assets, the CCDI said. It also harmed the revered herbal medicine brand, it said. Fourteen company executives, including Mei Qun, the Party chief and president of Tong Ren Tang Group, were criticized and five were demoted, dismissed or had their labor contracts terminated. All Party disciplinary actions and government sanctions were completed before Feb 3, local authorities said. Late on Monday, Tong Ren Tang Group said its bee industry subsidiary had been fined 14 million yuan ($2.07 million) by Yancheng's market regulation authorities. The company said some management personnel had processed returned honey and changed the labeled date of production. It said 2,284 bottles of expired honey had flowed into the market since October. According to the food and drug bureau in Beijing's Daxing district, where the company is registered, 3,300 bottles of honey have been confiscated. The food business license of Beijing Tong Ren Tang Bee Industry has been revoked and it will not be able to apply for a new one for five years. People involved in the case will be prevented from applying for business licenses in the food industry or engaging in food production or management work for five years. In 2016, a third-party investigation found that a batch of Manuka honey products marketed by Tong Ren Tang and imported from New Zealand had been adulterated with syrup."
0,"Track laying for the Beijing-Zhangjiakou high-speed railway, an essential mode of transportation for the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games, was completed on Wednesday. The 174-kilometer railway, which is scheduled to go into operation by the end of the year, will shorten the travel time from the current three hours between the two cities to less than one hour, according to China Railway Corp. Test runs begin in September. Its completion has significant meaning for enhancing the integrated development of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei province, as well as connecting the western region of the country. Ning Bin, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and professor at Beijing Jiaotong University, said at a transportation forum on Tuesday that autopilot technology will be used in the operation of the Beijing-Zhangjiakou high-speed railway. ""The technology has been tested on the Beijing-Shenyang high-speed rail,"" he said. ""The top-layer design is important for building the intelligent Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei transportation system."" ""Cloud computing and big data will be adopted by the system to accelerate the development of transportation in the area."" The Beijing-Zhangjiakou high-speed railway will have the world's first automatically driven trains that run at speeds of up to 350 kilometers per hour. Huang Jianchao, a deputy general manager of China Railway No 3 Engineering Group, which contracted one section of the railway, said inspections by robots increased the efficiency and accuracy of the project. According to the authority, a variety of intelligent robots will also be used at high-speed rail stations to guide passengers and help them carry their baggage. By using the Beidou Navigation Satellite System and automatic operating system, the train can automatically start, run between stations, adjust its timing according to the schedule, accurately stop at a station, and open and close its doors, according to the authority. The line will also connect with the Zhangjiakou-Hohhot high-speed railway, cutting travel time from Beijing to Hohhot, Inner Mongolia autonomous region, to three hours, down from nine. Ma Kanyan, president of Beijing-Zhangjiakou Intercity Co, said the lines connecting Hohhot to Zhangjiakou, and Datong in Shanxi province to Zhangjiakou, will be opened later this year and will be beneficial to tourism, urbanization and local economic growth along the lines."
1,"BEIJING - In face of trade tensions increasingly stirred up by the United States, China has ample trade weapons loaded to return fire and protect its own interests whenever necessary, officials and economists have said. Tension between the world's two largest economies reached a new height after the US side threatened additional duties on Chinese goods worth $100 billion Thursday. China, hours later, said it will ""fight till the end at any cost"" and take ""comprehensive countermeasures."" This has been the third round of trade fire exchange between the two economic giants, all of which were initiated by the US side. In the first two rounds, the United States slapped tariff on steel and aluminum imports from countries including China, as well as additional tariffs on Chinese imports worth $50 billion, to which China responded firmly with tariff plans of equal weight. For the latest US protectionist move, China also demonstrated full readiness to fight back ""fiercely"" with detailed countermeasures in the pipeline. ""We don't want a trade war, but we are not afraid of it,"" said China's Ministry of Commerce (MOC) Friday. Though details of the possible options were yet to be revealed, the country has hinted that all options are possible regarding the escalating situation. ""We are not taking any options off the table,"" Gao Feng, spokesperson with the MOC, said at a press briefing Friday. He Weiwen, an executive council member of the China Society for World Trade Organization Studies, said China still has many cards still up in its sleeve. Petroleum and liquid natural gas could be the possible options for future tariff hike if trade tension mounts, as China is the largest regional buyer of these US products, according to him. As the world's second largest economy, China should not be threatened by the United States, he said, noting that China's countermeasures of equal scale will produce equal effect on the United States. In the previous trade fire exchange, US products such as soybeans, automobiles, aircraft and chemical products have already been on the list of China's reciprocative tariff plan. ""I have to say that we were forced to take countermeasures, and we have reacted with restraint,"" Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen told reporters. Wang Xiaosong, a professor with Renmin University, said China's announced countermeasures have already hit the United States' tender spot, as US products like soybean and aircraft are highly dependent on the Chinese market. US soybeans sold to China account for 62 percent of its total soybean exports, with 32.85 million tons of soybeans exported to China in 2017, or 34.39 percent of China's total imports. ""With all the domestic industries united as one, China is stronger in economic resilience,"" Wang said. If trade tension escalates, China still has plenty of countermeasures at disposal and room for maneuver. Meanwhile, simulation calculations have shown that the US trade bashing will not be a threat on China, and China is fully capable of bearing the consequences brought by a trade war, according to Li Chunding, an associate research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. Vice Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao also reiterated earlier that China will not surrender to external pressure. ""Looking at it another way, external pressure is the driving force for innovation and development,"" Zhu said. China will continue reform and opening up, safeguard multilateral trade, and promote global trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, the commerce ministry has pledged."

Despite heavy winds and rain, thousands of sports enthusiasts took part in group exercises at Beijing's Olympic Park to mark the anniversary. With 2,022 physical fitness participants in attendance, Cai Qi, president of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics organizing committee, launched a global competition for designs of the official mascots of the winter sports extravaganza, inviting graphic artists from around the world to help visualize new images for the 2022 event. The Beijing 2022 organizing committee will keep online submissions open until Oct 31 for any individuals or companies interested. Winning bids are expected to be announced in the second half of 2019 after evaluation, modification and public review. ""We trust that you will produce fun mascots to fascinate people around the globe, and that they can be great examples for winter sports in particular,"" said Thomas Bach, president of the International Olympic Committee, via a video message. Brad Copeland, an IOC adviser, encouraged 2022 Winter Games mascot designers to challenge their imaginations as much as possible. ""I would say be wide open, avoid cliches and be your creative best,"" he said. Beijing has stepped up its preparations for the Winter Games with all 26 venues, including 11 existing ones from the 2008 Games, to be ready by the end of 2019. There is also a national campaign underway to involve 300 million people in winter sports activities before the 2022 Games. The anniversary celebration on Wednesday also marked China's 10th National Fitness Day, which is also considered an intangible Olympic legacy to inspire more and more Chinese to embrace sports and regular exercise as a lifestyle choice. The National Stadium, better known as the Bird's Nest, will host the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2022 Winter Olympics.

1,"A remote sensing survey has exposed serious ecological challenges in China’s two economic hubs – the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region in the north and Yangtze River Economic Belt along the great river. Wang Qiao, director of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment's satellite applications center, said the two regions have grown so rapidly they now have huge population densities. They face arduous difficulties in coordinated environmental protection and economic development amid continued intense urbanization. Per capita water resources in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region is only one-ninth of the national average, said the official. In the region, the water resource development rate has exceeded 100 percent since 2010, far beyond the internationally accepted safety range, except in 2012 when there was abundant water. About 70 percent of rivers in the region experience interruptions, while wetlands such as Baiyangdian and Qilihai have shrunk and long relied on supplied water. The riverside in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Economic Belt is overdeveloped and faces large ecological risks. According to the survey, the shoreline and beaches along the Yangtze River are only 44.0 percent and 19.4 percent of their natural state respectively. Wharfs occupy 430 kilometers of the riverbank, accounting for 5.4 percent of the total length. Shipyards and ship repair facilities also sprawl across 131 kilometers along the longest river in China. Chemical companies take up another 148 kilometers, posing a risk to the Yangtze River ecological environment."
1,"The nation will ramp up resources to strengthen international cooperation as it strives to build a globally competitive robotics industry and accelerate the use of smart machines in manufacturing, healthcare and other sectors. Miao Wei, minister of industry and information technology, the nation's industry regulator, said with robotics getting increasingly intertwined with artificial intelligence, big data and other technologies, the sector is playing an important role in driving economic growth. ""China, as the world's largest robot market, sincerely welcomes foreign companies to partake in the strategic opportunity to jointly build a global industrial ecosystem,"" Miao said at the opening ceremony of the 2018 World Robot Conference in Beijing on Wednesday. According to Miao, the ministry will roll out measures to encourage wider cooperation among Chinese companies, their international peers and foreign universities in technological research, product development and talent education.,China has been the world's largest market for robot applications since 2013. The trend has been further fueled by a corporate push to upgrade labor-intensive manufacturing plants. As the nation deals with an aging population, the demand for robots on assembly lines as well as hospitals is expected to jump significantly. Already, people aged 60 or older account for 17.3 percent of the total population in China, and the proportion is likely to reach 34.9 percent in 2050, official data show. Vice-Premier Liu He also attended the opening ceremony. He stressed that in the face of such demographic changes, China's robotics companies should move fast to adapt to the trend and get well-positioned to meet the potential huge demand. In the past five years, China's robotics industry has been growing at about 30 percent a year. In 2017, its industrial scale hit $7 billion, with the production volume of robots used in assembly lines exceeding 130,000 units, data from the National Bureau of Statistics show. Yu Zhenzhong, senior vice-president of HIT Robot Group, a major robot manufacturer in China, said the company is partnering with foreign robot heavyweights such as ABB Group of Switzerland as well as Israeli companies in product development.,""International cooperation is of crucial importance to build a well-organized global industrial chain. We help foreign companies better tap into the Chinese market and frequent communication can generate new ideas for cutting-edge technologies,"" Yu said. HIT Robot Group was established in December 2014 with funding from the Heilongjiang provincial government and the Harbin Institute of Technology, an elite Chinese university that has conducted years of cutting-edge research on robotics. The university was the manufacturer of China's first space robot and lunar vehicle. Yu said the company has also established a venture capital fund to invest in promising artificial intelligence startups in the United States. Yang Jing, general manager of self-driving business division at JD, said the large scale commercialization of robots will come earlier than most people have expected. ""Systematic unmanned logistics solutions, for instance, will be far more efficient and cost-effective than human delivery services in future. We are now already offering unmanned delivery services in a string of universities,"" Yang added."
0,"Air China has launched direct flights between Beijing and Hanoi, the Vietnamese capital, with two new services to follow, as the nation's flag carrier looks to boost air links between China and countries involved in the Belt and Road Initiative. The Hanoi route opened on Friday, and next month services will be launched between Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, and London; and between Beijing and the Russian city of Irkutsk via Hulunbuir Hailar Airport in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region, the company said. The airline had previously launched three other international flights this year linking China and countries involved in the Belt and Road Initiative: Hangzhou to Nha Trang, Vietnam; Chengdu to Bangkok, Thailand; and Beijing to Copenhagen, Denmark. ""The Belt and Road Initiative has provided opportunities and is a main driving force for Air China to build and expand our global air network,"" said Luo Yong, managing director of the carrier's marketing department. As of last month, Air China had 29 air routes linking China and Europe, providing 296 services a week. The number of routes has increased by 50 percent and the number of weekly flights has grown by 80 percent compared with five years ago, when the initiative was first proposed by President Xi Jinping. With the addition of the Beijing-Hanoi route, Air China now has 30 routes connecting China and the Asia-Pacific region, providing 352 services a week. ""The network covers 19 countries involved in the initiative and has had a positive impact on local communities,"" Luo said. One Air China employee who has noticed growth is Hu Haitao, who used to work in the airline's Bangkok office. ""In 2012, the airline had only one route in Thailand, providing one or two services daily. But in 2018, we now offer 12 routes, providing 14 services every day,"" said Hu, now deputy head of Air China's office in Islamabad, capital of Pakistan. He said more services bring additional tourists and business opportunities. The expanding network has also given local people employment opportunities. Stanislaw Volker, from Duesseldorf, Germany, has been working for Air China since 2011. He started out as a sales representative and is now the key account supervisor in the airline's Duesseldorf office, serving VIP clients. ""The company is a great platform, allowing me to find and improve myself,"" said Volker, 34. ""More Germans understand the company and China through me."" Volker, a fan and keen practitioner of Chinese comedic cross-talk, learned the language at university in Germany. Wang Xiangqing, deputy senior manager of Air China's cabin services department, said opening new routes meant serving a wider range of passengers properly, such as providing food and wine with a mixture of Chinese and local flavors on flights to certain destinations."
1,"Four decades ago, Xiantao village in Chongqing's Yubei district was home to farmers working small plots of land from dawn to dusk, just as their ancestors had done for thousands of years. On the same spot today is Chongqing Xiantao Big Data Valley, an industrial park for emerging sectors such as cloud computing and cross-border e-commerce. The park project is one of many examples of the transformation that has occurred in Yubei district since the central government launched reform and opening-up in 1978. Chongqing became the country's fourth municipality in 1997, joining Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin. A metropolis with more than 30 million people, it has a dynamic economy: GDP exceeded 1 trillion yuan ($144.8 billion) for the first time in 2011. Last year the figure reached 1.95 trillion yuan, up 9.3 percent year-on-year. Located north of the Jialing River, Yubei covers 1,452 square kilometers and has a population of 1.6 million. It was once an agricultural county with large fields and few industrial enterprises, and was among the least-developed areas of Chongqing. Yet efforts to boost technological innovation have seen Yubei grow into an industrial and high-tech power in western China. Its GDP has risen from 150 million yuan in 1978 to 144.7 billion yuan last year, leading the municipality's 38 districts and counties. Yubei is now the largest automobile manufacturing base in Chongqing and a major hub for the production, import and export of smart devices. ""Yubei has paid great attention to technological innovation,"" said Wang Wenwu, director of the district's science and technology committee. In 1982, a science research and development center was established in Yubei to develop and introduce new technologies to farmers. Three years later, a science development fund was set up with a government grant of 285,000 yuan. With this support, the area went on to develop a series of agricultural products that have become well known nationwide, including pickles, tea and liquor. In the 1990s, Yubei began to change from an agriculture county to an industrial district after the local authorities built large-scale development zones to attract investment. ""At that time, we already had a particular interest in high-tech companies that could help upgrade our industries,"" said Wang Huaiding, former head of Yubei. In 1998, Changan Automobile, one of the country's largest carmakers, built a factory in Yubei to produce 150,000 sedans a year. With the dawn of the 21st century, the government drafted a plan to build an ""innovation ecosystem"" to enhance the district's ability to support science research and development. Between 2013 and 2017, total R&D funding rose from 2.52 billion yuan to 5.7 billion yuan, with average annual growth of 26 percent. Now, scientific R&D accounts for 3.94 percent of Yubei's GDP, the highest of any area in Chongqing. As talent is key to innovation, the district plans to attract 1,000 high-level professionals from home and abroad in 10 pioneering technologies, including big data, cloud computing and artificial intelligence. It has also built a vocational college to teach big data skills. In recent years, Yubei has won a number of national awards in science development and innovation, including being named ""national model district in science advancement"" and ""most dynamic city in innovation""."
1,"BEIJING - All the preparation work including construction of the site and exhibits arrangement for the upcoming Beijing International Horticultural Exhibition has been completed as the official opening of the expo draws near, according to the organizer. Construction on the site as well as interior decoration for 110 official and 120 non-official exhibitors have all completed, with their respective operation teams already in place, said Wang Hong, deputy city mayor of Beijing at a press conference Wednesday. The construction and decoration of venues for all domestic exhibitors including 31 provincial-level regions, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan as well as 17 enterprises have also come to an end. Beijing will add more public transport services to facilitate visitors, while a total of 11 temporary parking lots have already been built, which will be able to accommodate over 20,000 cars, according to Wang. Around the theme of ""live green, live better,"" more than 2,500 cultural activities including a grand opening ceremony will be held during the expo, which is slated to open on April 29 in the district of Yanqing on the northern outskirts of Beijing. More than 110 official and 120 non-official exhibitors have confirmed participation, which will make it the highest attendance in the expo's history. ""We will continue to finish preparations for all work and try to offer the world a unique, wonderful and unforgettable horticultural gathering,"" Wang said. This is the second time China will hold such a high-level horticulture expo. The southwestern Chinese city of Kunming held the expo in 1999."
1,"BEIJING -- Two centers for foreigner exit and entry services opened Tuesday in Beijing to assist foreign talent in service industries.  The centers in Chaoyang and Shunyi districts will accept applications for permanent stays, long-term visas and port visas for foreign elites in the service sector, foreigner members of startups, Chinese with foreign nationality and young foreign students.  Shen Jinsheng, deputy director of Beijing Municipal Commission of Commerce, said the commission would issue recommendation letters for those working in the two districts who passed in a grading before applying for permanent stay.  The new service centers will shorten the period to apply for a permanent stay from 180 to 90 working days.  Many foreigners live in Chaoyang where most embassies and many international agencies and chambers of commerce are located. Shunyi, home to Beijing Capital International Airport, has over 100 international companies and a foreign population of around 8,000.  Li Kai On, a Chinese with British nationality, said he had applied for a permanent stay as he, a teacher at an international school, had seen opportunities in Beijing's education sector.  ""I hope with the new measures, I can become a real Chinese in a short time."""
0,"The discovery of rock garden in Beijing's Old Summer Palace will help the public better understand Qing-era construction. Wang Kaihao reports. In the northwestern corner of Beijing's Yuanmingyuan Ruins Park, which spreads over 340 hectares, is a 15-meter-high rock garden with over 1,000 pieces of megalith. It used to be the highest point of Yuanmingyuan (""the garden of perfect brightness"") - also known as Old Summer Palace - the large royal resort of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). The layout of Yuanmingyuan was designed as a scaled-down replica of the country's geographic features. So this rock garden represents the Kunlun Mountains, a range that extends over 3,000 kilometers on the northern edge of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in Northwest China. Invading Anglo-French forces burned down Yuanmingyuan in 1860 and turned this place once full of wonders into ruins. Nothing of consequence was visible around the rock garden until recently. In an excavation lasting from June to November, archaeologists discovered a huge garden at the foot of the ""miniature Kunlun Mountains"". The 13,700-square-meter Zibi Shanfang, which literally means ""a purple-and-green villa on the mountain"", was first built during the reign of Yongzheng (1722-35) and was renovated, in typical Jiangnan style (south of the Yangtze River), during the reign of his son Qianlong (1736-96).,Over 2,000 square meters were excavated this year. And archaeologists will expand the research site in 2019, says Zhang Zhonghua, leader of the archaeological team, who revealed the discovery to the public in Beijing last week. Many stone relics, including towers, palaces, roads, sewage systems and bridges, were also unearthed. ""I didn't expect so many findings because villagers from the surrounding area built new constructions after Yuanmingyuan was destroyed,"" Zhang says. Local people built and abandoned three villages in the area after 1860. But most of Zibi Shanfang's foundations survived. Zhang says the more than 2-meter-high foundation of the main hall in the garden was unearthed, and 2 meters are still underground. ""I've never seen so thick a foundation among the remains in Yuanmingyuan, which may show the great importance of this structure,"" he explains. ""The foundation is even more solid than reinforced concrete today. It reflects the high level of craftsmanship at that time."",A waterway was built in the garden to enable an emperor to enter by boat. Remains of several piers, which were absent in blueprints, were found. The discovery of these remains may help experts to more accurately determine the time of the garden's construction. ""Archaeological studies and historical records can complement each other,"" he says. Some constructional methods used above water are similar to those in Venice. The similarity does not necessarily mean that China learned from Italy in ancient times, or vice versa, Zhang says. ""However, similar situations may inspire common wisdom among different cultures."" A trail in the rock garden was also found in the recent discovery. Perhaps, Qianlong once stood at its highest point to view a panorama of the complex built at the zenith of Chinese garden construction. Zhang says many relics indicating olden-day scenes are scattered among the pieces of megalith and will need further study. Earlier this year, discovery of Ruyuan, a garden in the southeast of Yuanmingyuan, also grabbed public attention. According to Li Bo, director of the administrative office of Yuanmingyuan Ruins Park, there are 86 visible sites above ground in the park, but many more are buried underground. ""When talking about Yuanmingyuan, many people believe little was left despite its past splendor,"" Li says. ""However, that's not true. Many historical stories are hidden beneath the grass and earth but are neglected. ""We need to better display the sites after excavation. If the Forbidden City in Beijing is a museum for cultural relics, Yuanmingyuan can be a museum for ruins."",It's a widely held misconception among the Chinese public that Yuanmingyuan was built according to Western styles since the most famous aboveground icons that survived are columns and the gates of Xiyang Lou, a building that was built according to foreign conventions, Li says. ""However, Xiyang Lou accounts for only 2 percent of the area in Yuanmingyuan,"" Li explains. ""The true Yuanmingyuan can be unveiled through more studies on what's underground."" The government of Haidian district, where the park is located, has spent 5.6 billion yuan ($848 million) in recent years to relocate villagers living on an area of 22 hectares, which was the park of Yuanmingyuan. ""Villagers used to take bricks from the ruins to construct their own houses,"" Li says. ""Now, we've reclaimed more than 80,000 bricks or other components. They can be used to restore some sites in the park."" Some construction plans in Beijing have been amended to protect historical sites amid rapid urbanization. Yu Ping, deputy director of Beijing's Administration of Cultural Heritage, says the discoveries will consolidate the city's status as a national cultural hub. ""Multiple ways are being developed to better use these cultural resources to benefit the public,"" she says. ""That also serves the inheritance of cultural heritage, a goal emphasized by the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China."""
0,"Police raided a suspected illegal dog meat distribution network in northern Beijing over the weekend. Thirty-four dogs of various breeds were confiscated, including one with an identification chip. Yangfang Township police worked with local animal welfare groups to rescue the animals and took them to a municipal animal shelter. According to surveys and media reports over the past two years, the dog and cat meat trade has developed into a well-segmented industry that involves stealing, collecting, shipping, slaughtering and selling of the final products such as meat and fur. As public concerns have grown over the unquarantined animal products and their potential threat to health, Chinese authorities have taken the battle nationwide. Earlier this month, police closed down a holding site for stolen dogs in Chengdu, Sichuan province. More than 30 dogs were handed over to the Qiming Animal Protection Center－a local charity－where they were reunited with their owners or adopted. The charity's executives said the site was well-known as a depository for stolen pets before operators killed the animals and sold the meat. In July, a truckload of 200 cats and more than 100 dogs was intercepted by the police in Zhuzhou, Hunan province. The driver was fined 2,000 yuan ($300). On Aug 7, 24 suspected dog thieves were prosecuted in Anhui province for theft, hiding or concealing proceeds and producing and selling toxic or hazardous food, the prosecutor's statement said. Under Chinese law, anyone who produces and sells toxic or hazardous food can face the death penalty. Stealing pets and working animals, as well as unlicensed keeping of dogs of unknown origins, are serious crimes. Unlawful practices involved in the meat trade, such as trading, transporting, butchering unquarantined animals and processing and selling the meat, are being tackled by various law enforcement departments. From food safety to social stability, every link in the illegal meat trade chain breaks the law, said An Xiang, co-founder of Beijing Dexiang Law Firm. In 2015, a new Food Safety Law came into effect, raising standards for ensuring public health and safety. Consuming illegal dog and cat meat could bring severe health problems, said Liu Lang of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Association of Veterinarians of China. In June, the Ministry of Agriculture tightened quarantine provisions regarding dogs and cats, as well as certifications, to combat the undocumented transportation of unquarantined animals. The ministry said it will improve quarantines in response to a national legislator's suggestion about bringing an end to this kind of meat trade. Xinhua"
0,"With China now in peak flu season, authorities have said infections should remain under control, as no mutations that might boost the strength or drug-resistance of the virus have been detected. However, Beijing has seen a notable increase in infections among children since the start of the month, according to data from the Beijing Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Those affected are mostly students at primary schools and kindergartens. ""My colleague and I received over 300 patients between 4 am and 8 am on Tuesday,"" said Zhou Zhongshu, director of pediatrics at the capital's China-Japan Friendship Hospital. ""The number of daily patients has increased by over 30 percent to 600 or 700. ""Cross-infection is the main cause of the epidemics, especially at schools and in enclosed areas."" Daily outpatient visits to the pediatrics department of Beijing Children's Hospital have reportedly reached more than 10,000, a record level, while the number of children with respiratory tract infections and high fevers has increased by about 20 percent. The seasonal flu virus can cause high fever, headache, malaise and cough. Pneumonia, shock or even death could occur if the virus is not properly treated. Gu Li, a physician with the infectious diseases department of Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, said the flu season usually lasts three months in winter. Most patients get mild infections and will recover after treatment. However, seniors, pregnant women and children under age 5 are at higher risk, she warned. Five to 10 percent of adults and 20 to 30 percent of children worldwide are infected with flu every year, killing about 290,000 people, according to the World Health Organization."
0,"A hush fell over the crowd at Tianjin's Nankai University as Florence Chia-ying Yeh prepared to talk. It was a rare public appearance for the renowned poetry scholar in her mid-90s, and her fans were not about to miss a chance to see her. About 50 people had packed the small reading room of the college's Jialing Academy on June 24, and at least 60 more stood in a courtyard listening through speakers as she chatted about her life and recited poetry. Yeh has a special bond with Nankai. Not only has she taught there since 1989, when she retired from Canada's University of British Columbia, but she has also donated millions of yuan to establish scholarships and has pledged to make the college a significant beneficiary in her will. ""After announcing my plans to support Nankai University in setting up the Jialing scholarship to support research into Chinese traditional culture, many people have asked me why I'm committed to doing so,"" she said. ""I've never cared about personal wealth as I've weathered all types of challenges and endured many losses in my lifetime. In my darkest moments, it was poetry that enabled me to gain perspective."" Yeh was born in Beijing in 1924 on the first day of the sixth lunar month, which this year falls on July 13. When she was 17 years old, her mother died, so she was cared for by relatives since she had no contact with her father. She graduated in her 20s from Fu Jen Catholic University－which later became part of Beijing Normal University－and started teaching literature at a secondary school. In 1948, toward the end of the Chinese civil war, Yeh married Chao Chung-sun, who worked for the Kuomintang navy. The couple moved to Taiwan the next year after establishment of the People's Republic of China. Yeh found work at a school in Changhua. However, not long after arriving in Taiwan, Chao was arrested on suspicion of being a spy and imprisoned for three years. Yeh, who had given birth to a daughter only months earlier, was also briefly detained by police but no charges were brought against her. She lived with relatives until her husband's release in 1952 and continued to teach, later being recruited by National Taiwan University. In 1966, the couple moved to the United States, where Yeh taught Chinese poetry first at Michigan State University and then at Harvard University. They moved to Canada in 1969 when Yeh was offered tenure at UBC, where she now is professor emeritus. Tragedy again struck in 1976, when Yeh's eldest daughter and son-in-law were killed in a traffic accident in Toronto. Chao died in 2008. ""Enormous sorrow and hardship have propelled me to gain an outlook on life that I don't mind any success or failure, gain or loss,"" she said. That outlook helped her thrive in situations in which others may have foundered. When she arrived in the US, Yeh could teach only in Chinese. She knew this would have to quickly change. ""I had to support my entire family while living overseas. I worked to improve my language skills and understanding of the West so I could teach Chinese culture in English,"" she said. ""Every night I'd check dictionaries for every word of the Chinese poems I'd be discussing the following day."" Her hard work meant eventually she was able to explain fluently the styles and mindset of Chinese poets to Western audiences as well as present compelling interpretations of their poems to the wider world. Studies in Chinese Poetry, the 1988 book she co-wrote with Harvard professor James Hightower, is recognized for its profound impact on the global appreciation of Chinese poetry. Beginning in 1979, Yeh began spending summers teaching at various Chinese colleges, including at the prestigious Beijing, Nankai and Fudan universities. She offered her services for free and paid her own travel expenses. In 1978, she wrote the Ministry of Education asking to teach in her homeland, making Yeh－now a Canadian citizen－one of the first Chinese-born scholars to return from overseas. She was accepted and chose to teach at Nankai University, where in 1993 she became the founding director of the China Comparative Literature Institute, later renamed the Institute of Chinese Classical Culture. Yeh announced early last month she had donated 18.57 million yuan ($2.8 million) to the college to establish the Jialing scholarship. She also had helped fund a scholarship named in honor of her eldest daughter and son-in-law. This is the second scholarship program she has helped fund, with the first named in honor of her eldest daughter and son-in-law. Her appearance at Nankai on June 24 coincided with the university's annual Lotus Culture Day, which celebrates the ""lotus spirit"". In traditional Chinese culture, the flower represents purity. ""I've appreciated the 'lotus spirit' since I was young, and I've written many poems about the noble flower,"" she said. Her childhood nickname was Xiaohe, meaning Little Lotus, she added. Yeh, who recently had three articles published, also has kept her sense of humor. ""My two maids at home joke frequently about why, at my age, I'm always reading or writing papers, even sometimes becoming so engrossed that I forget to eat,"" she said, sparking laughter among the audience."
0,"China has been carrying out comprehensive inspections of all cram schools to ensure that those not meeting government standards make prompt corrections by the end of this year, the Ministry of Education said on Thursday. As of Wednesday, more than 400,000 cram schools from across the country had been inspected, Lyu Yugang, director of the ministry's Basic Education Department, said at a news conference in Beijing. Inspectors have found that 273,000 cram schools were not up to the standards, and 248,000 of them have had their programs changed to bring them in line, Lyu said. Beijing's education, civil affairs, human resources and social security, and market regulation departments have inspected more than 12,600 cram schools, and 93 percent of those found to have problems have made necessary changes, said Feng Hongrong, deputy inspector of the Beijing Education Commission. After corrections are made, which is expected by year's end, the city will carry out a second round of inspections in January to make sure the changes hold, he said. Some training institutions have quietly changed the name of their courses in an attempt to duck the inspections, but authorities will invite more experts to carry out unannounced inspections, with violators dealt with seriously, he added. In February, the Education Ministry and three other ministries jointly issued the first of a series of guidelines to regulate providers of after-school classes. ""Teachers who lure or coerce students to attend after-school training classes will be dealt with seriously or even stripped of their teaching credentials,"" the guidelines said. They added that institutions should not teach anything outside the syllabus, and they should submit their course plans, enrollment targets and class hours to local education authorities for approval. They are not allowed to organize graded examinations or conduct competitions for primary or secondary school students. In addition, the training results from these institutions cannot be used as criteria for future enrollment in primary or middle schools, the guidelines said. Wang Meng, the mother of a fifth-grade student in Beijing, said she welcomed the government's moves to regulate the cram schools, but she still has concerns. ""Although I really want my son to have more time to play, I have to remind myself to be rational,"" Wang said. ""Only by entering a key middle school can he study at a key high school and later at a good university. There's no other option."" To qualify for admission into a key middle school, he has to study hard now, she said. Her son attends five weekly after-school tutoring classes, one each in Chinese, English and piano and two in mathematics, and the family spends around 100,000 yuan ($14,500) a year on such classes. ""When it comes to education, every family is a 'rich' family,"" she said, indicating that families will scrape up as much money as they can for extra instruction."
0,"BEIJING - Three new longer Fuxing bullet trains will start to run on the Beijing-Shanghai line on July 1, China Railway Beijing Group Co Ltd said Friday. With a designed speed of 350 kilometers per hour, the new train measures more than 400 meters in length and has 16 carriages, twice as many as current ones, according to the bureau. It can carry nearly 1,200 passengers. Internet, power supply, and tourist information systems have all been upgraded on the new trains, said Zhang Bo, a researcher at the China Academy of Railway Sciences Corporation Limited. The longer trains began testing in Beijing in June. Entirely designed and manufactured in China, the Fuxing, or Rejuvenation, trains are more spacious and energy-efficient, with a longer service life and better reliability than previous models. Over the past decade, China has rapidly developed its high-speed railways. The country currently has the world's longest high-speed rail network, about one-third of which has been designed to run at a speed of 350 km per hour."

1,"New regulations of name boards in Beijing will not lead to ""monotony"" or affect the signage of time-honored brands, a city official has said. The rule change in late September and subsequent enforcement campaign, which has seen many signboards removed from buildings, is not aimed at stifling character but to encourage property owners to design their signage within a ""prescribed frame"", according to an unnamed official from the Beijing Commission of City Management quoted by Qianlong, a website operated by the city government. ""Signage of time-honored brands would not disappear, and the signage across Beijing would not become monotonous,"" the official said. The commission launched a citywide signage management campaign in December, which limits the number and placement of signs on buildings in order to ""create an urban skyline that is visually clear and bright"". The campaign was launched as part of the capital's urban plan for 2016 through 2035. According to a notice from the commission, all signs and billboards attached to roofs must be removed. In addition, there can be only one sign with a building's name on the third story or higher, and the name should be the same as the one registered with planning authorities. Each of the capital's 16 districts will launch an enforcement campaign, the notification said, and any failure by institutions and individuals to remove noncompliant signs will be noted on their credit record. Signage must be removed by the end of December and the commission will inspect the capital ""road by road"" in January, the notice said. The campaign has provoked heated discussion online. While some Beijing residents applauded the campaign, some were worried it will be difficult for them to find their destinations. A netizen named Cycy Lee didn't like the feeling of walking near buildings with signs over the roofs. ""Some of the signs or billboards have been there for years and they may fall down,"" the netizen commented on Weibo. Others are concerned about losing their way after losing sight of signage. ""Without signage, I experienced much difficulty in finding the destination in places I am not familiar with,"" said Shi Shunji, a resident of Haidian district. In response to these concerns, the official said the commission would work along with property owners to reinstall new signage ""as soon as possible"". ""In future enforcement, we would have the new signage designed first and then replace the old, so we can shorten the void period and do not influence people's lives,"" the official said."
0,"BEIJING - Five-year-old Peng Xiaoyi has never met his English teacher in person. While he sits in front of a computer in his home in Beijing, this teacher is thousands of kilometers away in the United States. Peng, who is in his second year of kindergarten in northwest Beijing, takes online English classes after school, which are taught by teachers based in the United States and Canada. ""The American teachers are fun,"" he said. ""I like them a lot."" Even after taking just a handful of classes, he has become more confident in speaking English and developed a habit of preparing and reviewing the lessons, according to his mother Li Juan. ""It is good for him to take American-style classes,"" said Li, a civil servant. ""This is a new experience for him and he doesn't even have to leave China."" Thanks to the development of the Internet across China, online education has become increasingly popular in the country of 1.3 billion people. VIPKID, the platform that runs Peng's classes, has over 200,000 registered students in China and more than 24,000 teachers in the North American region. Mi Wenjuan, founder of VIPKID, told Xinhua that she hopes to change the way Chinese children learn English and offer them opportunities to experience native English teaching styles, which are very different to how English is taught in Chinese schools. ""One of the major challenges we have face is parents accepting the concept of online learning,"" she said. ""We have to continuously offer high-level teaching and technical support."" Data from the China Internet Network Information Center showed that 144 million Chinese have undertaken online education as of June this year, 4.8 percent higher than the number by the end of 2016. ""Compared with traditional after school classes, online courses are convenient and efficient,"" said Li Juan. ""They are also less expensive because no venues are needed."" He Tingting, a teacher working for online education platform ""Qingqingjiajiao"", said an online teacher usually teaches one-on-one or in small groups while traditional after school classes have one teacher for 30 to 40 students. ""Online teachers use powerpoints to assist our teaching,"" said He. ""They are more attractive to students, particularly for younger children."" However, He said online teachers have to work harder to make their voices and facial expressions more engaging in order to hold students' attention. ""Reliable Internet connections are also very important to ensure the courses go smoothly."" Online education has become increasingly known to Chinese in recent years, particularly since 2013 when MOOC, short for massive open online courses, entered China in cooperation with universities and websites. In the last couple of years, capital inflow from investors helped online education firms develop at a faster speed. A survey issued by HSBC this year showed that 76 percent of Chinese parents would consider online university courses for their children. ""As consumption levels rise and the second-child policy takes effect, China is likely to become one of the world's most dynamic online education markets in the future,"" said Mi."
0,"It'd been just over a week since my arrival in Chengdu. I had spent nearly three weeks in Beijing before coming to Chengdu and it was an absolute riot. I was part of a large group of teaching interns that were being trained and housed on the UIBE (University of International Business and Economics)campus in the first weeks of February. For all intents and purposes my time in Beijing was as Chinese as wal-mart or Macdonalds. The majority of our time was spent frollicking around in the blistering cold going to pubs and western cafes. One of the favorite spots being a little sports bar just down the street named Laker's where you could get a delicious burger and ten pints for around $10 dollars.   Even before getting on the plane things started to go wrong. Someone became too ill to board and had to be rushed to the hospital where they would be diagnosed with pneumonia. As a result of their premature evacuation the oragnizing member of staff that was supposed to accompany us on the trip became separated and upon arrival I along with 10 other interns were left hanging in the wind. We were however treated to a very sophistocated lunch at a european dining area before heading to the bureau of education. It was there that we met the leaders of our respective schools for the first time and set off rather anticlimactically to our new homes for the coming months.  Arriving on a Friday afternoon I was given the weekend to settle in to my new apartment which was admittedly very nice and contained far more than I had anticipated. So for the next two days I walked around my neighborhood taking in the sights and sounds, the smells and tastes of the streets next to mine. Those two days flew by however and come Monday morning I found myself standing before nigh 1,500 students giving my introductory speech. It didn't contain much and I was given a heads up so after some fervent practice it became a fairly managible task. Indeed it went off without a hitch and I was rewarded with the cheers and applause of all those young adults.  What I wasn't ready for was what happened next. After giving my speech I was told that I now had to teach two lessons back to back to the same class. This was a terrifying prospect. Not four days before then I was in Beijing standing in front of my peers giving my first lesson as part of a group of three. Upon being informed that I had two lessons to give without any preparation time I actually began laughing out loud at the notion. I walked into class and with all the clout of a scared little puppy I tried to get everyone to settle down and focus on me. I had no idea what I was doing. The two forty minute classes turned into a never ending Q&A about America and myself in regards to anything you would remotely consider personal. It got the job done I suppose but damn was it rough getting there. Thankfully those two classes were all I had for that day and in fact my first week I only taught a total of seven classes. Not a bad way to ease into a new job. It wasn't until the second week that things became far more interesting.  At the end of the first week I was given a schedule for the following week which contained over three times as many classes as the former. It was never once mentioned how many classes I would be teaching or what material to teach throughout that whole first week where I spent aproximately forty hours sitting at my desk doing nothing. This left me with the weekend to prepare for twenty-two classes. Like any prudent and thurough advocate of knowledge I waited 'til the very last possible moment to start my lesson planning, Sunday evening a few hours before I planned to be asleep.  Monday morning dragged itself to my front door and kicked it in with the force of a small army. It started miserably and without surprise continued to be miserable. I was still a little nervous about getting in front of all these groups of kids and my lack of preparation did nothing to promote a sense of confidence. I managed to get to wednesday before sucumbing to a rather nasty infection. My illness brought me to the apex from which I didn't think things could get any worse. I arose on Thursday morning and rushed to the bathroom spewing shit from both ends of my body. It was a nightmare. I phoned into work saying that I couldn't make it that day, that I was ill and needed to rest. Within a few hours four members of the school including the the head of the English department arrived at my abode to take me to the hospital. It was magnificent. They spoke to the doctors for me and paid for my medication, bought me a large box filled with cartons of milk and a bag of fresh fruit. I lay peacefully in utter awe of the level of care I had received. The following day I also stayed home and again two teachers showed up at lunch time and cooked me a homemade meal of dumplings and soup. I couldn't believe it, really. I'm almost positive that if the situation had been reversed and a chinese person had come to America under similar circumstances the only thing they'd get if they were sick is the middle finger. For me this marked a turning point that opened my eyes to the beauty that was all around me. Sure Chengdu isn't what I'm used to, the toilets are basically holes in the ground, the concept of a set schedule bears little meaning, and there's clouds in the sky literally all the time, but when you get a chance to see past the exterior what's underneathe satisfies the soul in a way the senses never could. I am truly grateful for all that my school and it's people have done to make me feel welcome in this new home of mine. In earnest, I wouldn't want to be anywhere else rather than here in Chengdu."

1,"The China International Import Expo has provided strong impetus for increased trade between China and Russia, a Russian official said at the expo on Tuesday, as the country looks to better facilitate growth of exports to China. ""It (CIIE) is a serious opportunity for Russian companies to make themselves known, to demonstrate their goods to potential importers and consumers,"" said Andrey Slepnev, general director of the Russian Export Center Group, a government-owned institute that supports exports. Speaking during a news briefing on the sidelines of CIIE, Slepnev said the expo has already shown that it is a world-class event by its scale and the number of political and business leaders in attendance. The Russian delegation is led by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev. After the expo opened on Monday, he briefed President Xi Jinping at the Russian pavilion about the achievements of the two nations in the fields of nuclear power, natural gas and aviation. At a later meeting with Medvedev on Monday, Xi said China and Russia should continue to deepen cooperation in many areas, including energy, agriculture, finance, science and innovation. The trade volume between China and Russia reached more than $77 billion in the first three quarters of the year, a rise of 25.7 percent from the same period a year before, the Ministry of Commerce said. The rate of growth is the fastest among all of China's main trading partners, and the bilateral trade volume is expected to reach $100 billion this year, the ministry said. Slepnev said more than 100 Russian companies are taking part in the expo, and many signed cooperative agreements with their Chinese counterparts, mostly in the services and transport sectors, in the first two days. The expo has made it much easier and transparent for businesses to strike deals because it reduces intermediary procedures, and it allows foreign businesses to appreciate China's competitive environment and become acquainted with manufacturers from other countries. Slepnev noted that Russia has seen strong export growth to China since the start of the year, especially in forestry, steel and food products, and there has also been strong interest from Chinese buyers in Russian skin care, cosmetics and children's products. As part of efforts to increase Russian exports to China, the export center group will establish trade offices in Beijing and Shanghai, along with agencies in more than 20 cities nationwide to better serve Russian companies, he said, adding that the group will also help more Russian companies to pitch products via China's booming e-commerce platforms."
0,"An ongoing exhibition in Beijing brings together artists from China and Europe. Lin Qi reports. Three artists featured at the Bridging Asia-Europe exhibition series－Wang Luyan from China, Gianni Dessi from Italy and Alois Mosbacher from Austria－show how some artists who grew up in a less-globalized world still managed to develop individual styles and reshape the landscape of contemporary art. Bridging Asia-Europe, launched by The Parkview Museum in Beijing, is a series of exhibitions to encourage communication between Asian and European artists. The first show, now underway through Sept 17, teams up Wang, Dessi and Mosbacher, whose artworks are part of collections of George Wong, the museum's founder and an entrepreneur from Hong Kong. Through their paintings and installations, the three artists demonstrate distinctive approaches to topics in today's world, such as openness, freedom, traditions and respect. The series will include exhibitions by other artists as well. Lorand Hegyi, the current exhibition's Hungarian curator, says the three artists were all born in the early 1950s, a period when the world was divided into two ""antagonistic hemispheres"". ""Their generation witnessed many critical events of the Cold War. When the three artists became active in the 1980s, they staged (works) on the platform of multicultural globalization."",  Hegyi, 63, is also from that generation. The art historian and critic has been focusing on contemporary art from central and Eastern Europe. He says the artists of his generation, like the three on show, were able to create a globalized discourse that was based on the concept of different identities. Their works communicate between the East and the West and bring people a ""touching and comforting experience"", he says. Wang is known for producing paintings that are as precisely executed as an engineering project. Hegyi says that, underneath these seemingly mechanical lines in Wang's works, viewers can sense ""irrational and self-destructive"" tendencies of the subjects he focuses on and addresses the paradoxical status of many people. In his shown work W Screw, Wang says he sees the object as ""a spiritual totem that does not fit in with the filth of the real world"". He conveys an isolation from his surroundings and a powerful desire for difference.,  In another shown painting, Birdcage, he draws an intricate birdcage to invite the audience to think about whether the boundary between freedom and confinement has blurred. Dessi shows a group of blue watercolor works on paper he completed earlier this year. He says the works belong to his ongoing series, China Suite. He says he chose blue because the Yangtze River is referred to as the Blue River in Italy. For the series, he poured blue colored water on a stack of paper and let the pigment slowly seep into it. He created this based on how natural traces are left on things by water. With this, he says he hopes to show both time and water as two generative forces of life. According to Hegyi, Dessi gives voice to the romantics of our day by formulating dramatic visual metaphors in his works, and hails a ""spiritual resistance"" against emptiness and indifference. In Mosbacher's oil paintings, he creates a poetic, sometimes puzzling feeling by portraying landscapes of a forest, a field and arrangements of tree trunks. For example in his painting Nine Trees, he simply painted nine trees, and modeled them after real photos he had taken in forests.,  Unlike a real forest in which trees grow naturally, Mosbacher arranged the trees in his work in a neat, artificial way, as if they were elements of a program. Hegyi says those unnatural scenes portrayed in Mosbacher's works are a metaphor of the chaotic side of the real world, and he urges his viewers to confront their own hidden universes. ""Like Mosbacher, one will find in himself a forgotten but still vivid and effective empire full of unlimited imagination.""

0,"The Ministry of Culture and Tourism said it has started investigations into the hotels and has instructed its branches in five provinces and municipalities to investigate, including Shanghai, Beijing, Fujian, Jiangxi and Guizhou, Xinhuanet reported on Friday. In response to a viral video exposing shoddy cleaning practices at 14 luxury hotels, health departments in Shanghai and Beijing, where most of the disgraced hotels were located, dispatched inspection teams on Thursday to take a closer look. Health officials in Beijing's Dongcheng, Haidian and Chaoyang districts collected samples from four of the hotels shown in the video. Test results will be made public, they said. The Beijing Municipal Commission of Tourism Development summoned managers of the four hotels for an inquiry on Thursday. If the claims are true, the hotels will be ordered to rectify their hygiene procedures. The 11-minute video titled The Secrets of Cups, was produced and uploaded to Sina Weibo on Wednesday night by a well-known Chinese blogger who goes by the username Hua Zong Diu Le Jin Gu Bang. Within 24 hours of its release, the video was viewed more than 14 million times, sparking heated discussions in print and online media. Some of the hotels mentioned in the video were the Waldorf Astoria Shanghai, the recently opened Bulgari Hotel Shanghai, the Park Hyatt Beijing and the Aman Summer Palace Luxury Resort in Beijing. A one-night stay at any of these hotels costs at least 1,000 yuan ($144). The video showed housekeepers cleaning drinking mugs with soiled towels or the same cloth that was used to wipe toilet seats. Wu Dong, the blogger who made and shared the video, identified himself in an introduction as a person who may have stayed at the most hotels in China. A self-employed investor, he claimed to have spent 2,000 nights at 147 luxury or boutique hotels in the country over the past six years. Wu said all the footage was recorded this year. He was inspired to create it after walking in on a housekeeper who was using a bath towel to clean cups. ""It's a problem prevalent in the entire industry. The reason I exposed the 14 hotels in particular is that they are the most expensive, the most popular or are generally considered bench marks of the industry,"" he said in a Beijing News video on Thursday. Better known by his pseudonym, Hua Zong Diu Le Jin Gu Bang-which means ""Monkey King has lost his magic cudgel""-Wu rose to fame in 2012 for using news photos to identify and list the 11 luxury wristwatches worn by a government official in Shaanxi province. The revelation led to an investigation and the official was later sentenced to 14 years in prison for corruption. The Park Hyatt Beijing and the Shangri-la Hotel Fuzhou, which were among the 14 hotels featured in the video, issued apology letters on Thursday, saying that they would conduct additional training and self-checks. This is not the first time that some of China's most expensive and sought-after hotels have been caught in shoddy cleaning practices. Last year, five luxury hotels in Beijing failed to change bedsheets as required after guests checked out. Lanmei Test, an organization that claims to be independent, released a video on WeChat of an undercover inspection in which its employees left marks on sheets, toilets and cups at several five-star hotels. The marks-visible only under ultraviolet light-were still there when Lanmei employees checked into the same rooms the next day."
0,"One of China's finest oil painters has made her first foray into virtual-reality art, a digital debut that has proved to be as painstaking as it was rewarding. Deng Zhangyu reports. The darkness is broken by a sharp light. All of a sudden, a newborn baby is brought into the world, kicking and screaming. The doctor holds the baby in her arms, walking toward a set of scales. Everyone in the delivery room－the mother lying on the bed, the doctors in attendance and the infant herself－can be viewed from every angle, just as in the real world. However, these are not actual three-dimensional characters－they have been meticulously painted in oil, and yet can only be viewed in virtual reality. This is the first scene in artist Yu Hong's virtual-reality work She's Already Gone, which is being exhibited at Beijing's Faurschou Foundation gallery, in what is reportedly the first hand-painted virtual reality work in the world. In it, the Beijing-based artist paints four scenes depicting the four stages of life, from birth to burial. ""Virtual reality allows viewers to immerse themselves in an imaginary world, something that literature, film and traditional painting have been trying to achieve for a long time,"" says Yu, 52, at her studio in Beijing. With imagery, sound and music, the eight-minute VR artwork provides the viewer with an immersive experience that bears witness to the four phases of a woman's life, set in different eras of time: a newborn baby in the 1990s; a girl looking out of her bedroom window in the 1970s; a woman from the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) unfolding the cloth that had bound her feet since childhood; and a priestess singing at a funeral ritual in the Neolithic era, nearly 5,000 years ago. Viewers can walk into each of the individually created rooms and view the work from whatever angle they choose. It took Yu almost a year to finish the work. She had to plan and paint countless details to create each character, from their faces and skin down to locks of their hair. She had to complete more than 60 individual oil paintings to finish the artwork.,Working closely with a virtual-reality art company based in Denmark, she was in constant touch with the tech team in Copenhagen, emailing them on a daily basis. As she painted, she scanned the images and sent them to the team to ""put clothes on the naked virtual figures. ""I did my best to push the boundaries of my imagination. It's difficult to transform oil paintings into three-dimensional works,"" Yu says of her yearlong collaboration with Khora Contemporary, the Danish team specializing in virtual-reality art. At the opening ceremony on Jan 6, many of Yu's artist friends came to experience the work, and they seemed impressed. Oil painter Su Xinping says he could feel the pain when he watched the woman from the Ming Dynasty remove the strips of cloth binding her feet. He also expressed an interest in making a VR artwork. Yu says her peers from the art world were impressed by the visual interaction of the work, and described the future trend of combining art with technology as both inevitable and unpredictable. She described the Beijing art space showing her work as a ""hospital with many cubicles housing people wearing headsets"" and a totally different experience from traditional exhibition halls with art pieces mounted on the walls. ""I don't know how art will be presented in the future. But I do know that art gives cold tech a warm hue,"" Yu says. In She's Already Gone, Yu focuses on women and explores their social status and experiences, a recurring topic for the artist, who is one of the most important oil painters in China. ""The priestess in the Neolithic era enjoyed the highest social class in a matriarchal society,"" Yu says. The three other scenes reflect Yu's own life experiences: Her grandmother was forced to bind her feet from childhood; the girl sitting on a windowsill watching a parade was Yu at the age of 6 in 1972 during the ""cultural revolution"" (1966-76); and the opening scene depicts her giving birth to her daughter in the 1990s.,One of the artist's own paintings appears on the wall in the second scene of the work, which depicts Yu's childhood. The work is part of her ongoing Witness to Growth series, an annual biographical series where she produces a self-portrait and pairs it with an image from a news article recording a key event that year. Another work from the series depicting the year of 1992 was exhibited at the Guggenheim Museum's Art and China after 1989: Theater of the World. In the 1992 painting, Yu is seen cutting her hair in a portrait taken from her movie The Days, the debut by filmmaker Wang Xiaoshuai. Yu and her husband, Liu Xiaodong, who's also a famous oil painter, played the lead roles as an artist couple in the movie. ""Every year, I paint a work to record my life, often just to document common things or interesting moments that I think deserve to be remembered,"" explains Yu. Yu gained fame early on. When she was still a freshman at the Central Academy of Fine Arts, one of her sketches was selected as a painting for an educational art book aimed at teenagers. After graduation, she became an art teacher at the academy, where she still works. Painting has become an important part in Yu's life－one she regards as a refuge from the rapidly evolving technological world outside. And while her first foray into virtual reality has proved to be an interesting experience, it's unlikely she will pursue the emerging technology as her career. Oil painting is, after all, her life's work. 10 am-6 pm, through Feb 3. Faurschou Foundation, 798 art zone, 2 Jiuxianqiao Road, Chaoyang district, Beijing. 010-5978-9316."

0,"A Chinese tourist group began a visit to South Korea on Saturday, eight months after package tours were halted because of a diplomatic dispute sparked by the US military's deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system in the country. The tourist group of 32 people from Beijing will spend five days in Seoul, according to Sun Lichan, director of the marketing department of Haitao Travel, the tourism company that organized the trip. Any industry related to Lotte Group will be avoided in the company's new travel schedules, Sun said. The Lotte Duty Free Shop, a former popular shopping spot for Chinese tourists, will be replaced by the Shilla Duty Free Shop. Lotte Group, a retail giant in South Korea, accepted a plot of land in February in exchange for its Skyhill Golf Course in Seongju, where the US antimissile system will be deployed, a move that China strongly opposes. South Korea's trade and tourism industries saw downturns because of the THAAD issue. In March, Chinese travel agencies stopped selling package tours to South Korea after the THAAD deployment. ""As bilateral relations between the two sides have eased slowly recently, we began to reorganize group tours by contacting airline companies and travel agencies we can cooperate with in South Korea,"" Sun said. The company got a group visa to South Korea on Thursday－the first group visa to the country since March, Sun said. The group took an Asiana Airlines flight from Beijing Capital International Airport to South Korea's Incheon International Airport on Saturday, she said. ""Tourism to South Korea will recover gradually, but it's still a long way from the situation of a year ago,"" Sun said. Xu Xiaolei, chief brand officer for China Youth Travel Service, said: ""Customer consultations about group tours or travel visas to South Korea, either in person at our offices or by phone or online, have increased recently, but we have little data about traveling to South Korea."""
0,"Beijing plans to add more kindergarten slots and strengthen security measures to make sure children can receive an affordable and safe preschool education, officials said on Thursday. Feng Hongrong, deputy inspector of the Beijing Education Commission, said the city plans to enroll another 30,000 kindergartners through renovating and expanding existing operations, and to support State-owned and private enterprises, institutions, communities and individuals in building of new ones. The city already added 30,000 new kindergarten slots last year to meet the increasing demand of preschool education with the implementation of the second child policy and more migrant workers coming to the city, he said at a news conference in Beijing. Beijing has 450,000 kindergarten students, 63 percent of whom attend public kindergartens, he said. The city has made great efforts to ensure the safety of kindergarten students by making sure the public areas in the facilities are covered by surveillance cameras and that camera footage is guarded and stored for 30 days, Feng said. At least two kindergarten caretakers should be present at all times with students, he added, noting that educators have worked closely with public security authorities. Tian Gewen, principal of the Kindergarten of the General Research Institute for Nonferrous Metals in Beijing's Haidian district, said the municipal government has offered 1,000 yuan($149) per month of subsidies for each student and the district government has offered another 500 yuan per month for each student. The students are only required to pay tuition of 900 yuan per month. Apart from ensuring students get a high-quality education, the subsidies are also used to increase the salaries of teachers and give them better training, she said. To ensure that more students receive inexpensive yet high-quality preschool education, the school added 270 new kindergarten slots in 2016, she said. It now has 18 classes and more than 540 students. Children attending public kindergartens or affordable private ones will account for 80 percent of all preschoolers by 2020, according to a directive issued recently by the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council. Affordable, quality preschools will be the priority, the ministry said. Governments at all levels are encouraged to establish public kindergartens, aiming to get about 50 percent of all preschool children into public education by 2020, it said. Communities, State-owned enterprises and public institutions such as universities are also encouraged to establish their own kindergartens, it said. Lyu Yugang, director of the ministry's basic education department, said the central government will allocate 16.8 billion yuan to support preschool education."
1,"The world's first high-field magnetic resonance-guided linear accelerator－a new radiation therapy system that can locate tumors precisely, tailor the shape of X-ray beams in real time, and adapt radiation doses even to moving tumors while a patient is being treated－will make its debut at the upcoming first China International Import Expo. The machine, called Elekta Unity, developed by Stockholm-headquartered cancer care device and solution company Elekta, combines an MRI scanner and the linear accelerator radiation therapeutic technology in a single system, which used to be considered nearly impossible, because powerful MRI magnets could interfere with radiation beams. Elekta President and CEO Richard Hausmann said the Shanghai expo is an ideal opportunity for the company to showcase its groundbreaking technologies, further enhance its brand image as a global leader in precision and personalized cancer treatment sector, and reaffirm its commitment to China. ""The machine uses highly precise radiation to kill cancer through a non-invasive surgical approach. We will exhibit the machine and other products at the CIIE, because we want to showcase our innovation capabilities in cancer care at this important expo in China,"" said Hausmann. ""We come from Sweden, a small country which always has to export and do international trade because the local market is very small ... We support all the efforts of the Chinese government and the country to keep this free trade moving, in both ways ... in and out. We want to strengthen our cooperation with local companies in various fields on research and development for the future."" The company is planning to take a huge booth of more than 200 square meters at the expo and will man it with technicians, and marketing and sales professionals. The Chinese market is very important for the company, Hausmann said, adding that the company is a market leader in China, but still expects an even stronger presence, because Chinese hospitals develop fast, and device standards are increasing rapidly. The machine will be very appealing to the fast-growing precision and personalized cancer care market in China, because it can deliver doses of radiation more precisely and effectively, and reduce the number of treatment sessions, on the basis of its clear and real-time visualization of tumors and healthy tissues, especially when tumors happen in the brain, spine and abdomen, and because other medical imaging methods, such as CT scans, cannot deliver clear pictures distinguishing tumors and healthy soft-tissues, according to Hausmann. Besides, Elekta's largest manufacturing base outside Europe is China. It also has a global research and development center and an Asia-Pacific training center in Beijing. The core component of the machine, the linac, is co-designed and produced in China, which is another reason the company wants to exhibit it at the expo, said Hausmann. Currently, the company holds a 55 percent share of the imported radiation medical device market in China, and accounts for 45 percent of the overall radiation device market, said Gong Anming, executive vice-president and China CEO of Elekta. Five of the machines will be used in clinical trials on the Chinese mainland, by some top hospitals in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangdong, Sichuan and Shandong provinces, while global orders for either clinical trials or commercial use total 40, including two for Hong Kong, according to Gong. The company expects Chinese patients will be able to receive radiation treatment delivered by the machine in 2020."
0,"Tan Dun will lead a symphony orchestra and a Mongolian rock band on a fusion path at the ongoing Shanghai festival. Chen Nan reports.  Chinese composer and conductor Tan Dun is a musician of many sounds. Despite his background in classical music - he was trained at the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing in the 1970s, Tan has created music with the sounds of water, wind, paper and the chirping of birds produced by phones.  Combining classical symphony with rock in his latest experiment, the 60-year-old composer will take the baton, together with the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra and Hanggai, a rock band of ethnic Mongolian musicians, to present a concert, titled Symphonic Rock, in Shanghai on Monday.  The concert is part of the ongoing Music in the Summer Air festival, which kicked off on July 2, and will run for two weeks.  Tan's new work, titled Shanghai Transistor, will premiere at the upcoming concert.  Adapted from one of the songs of Hanggai, with the same title, Shanghai Transistor keeps the rock beats while integrating the symphonic elements. The hit number Four Seasons Song, performed by the late Zhou Xuan, a pop singer and actress from Shanghai, has also been used in the piece.  ""Classical music is struggling to reach new and young audiences. You cannot blame the young people,"" says Tan. ""Rock music is free and enjoyed by young people. By combining rock and symphony orchestra, I want to give classical music a bigger power, longer influence and a larger young audience.""  Hanggai, the Mongolian term for a place with beautiful pastures, mountains and rivers, was formed by ethnic Mongolian musicians in Beijing in 2004. Now, it has eight members, including the vocalist Ilchi, the morin khuur (horse-head fiddle) player Batubagen and vocalist-guitarist Yilalata.  Tan said in an earlier interview that ""Hanggai is from the vast Mongolian grasslands. I love their music because they have the power of the Earth and nature. Their music also represents a world trend in making music"".  According to Ilchi, who uses his throat sounds as the main vocal contribution, Hanggai collaborated with the National Symphony of China under the baton of Tan during a concert at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing in 2016. They performed together at concerts held in Macao and Shenzhen, Guangdong province, as well.  ""Tan can be global and local with his compositions. His attempts to combine symphonic music with rock are both bold and interesting,"" says Ilchi.  The song Shanghai Transistor is from one of the band's album, titled Horse of Colors, which was released last year. The album features the traditional sounds produced in two distinct pitches by one vocalist, folk instruments and Mongolian lyrics.  At the upcoming concert in Shanghai, the band will collaborate with the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, performing six original songs, such as Horse of Colors and The Rising Sun.  Another symbol of the grasslands - the Mongolian wolf - inspired Tan's work, Contrabass Concerto: Wolf Totem in 2014. The piece of music also will be presented at the Shanghai concert.  The composer began to work on the piece after reading the Chinese novel Wolf Totem by Jiang Rong. The book tells the story of a young man's obsession with the endangered wolf in the grasslands of the Inner Mongolia autonomous region.  ""Mirroring the human spirit and our relationship with the natural world,"" as the composer describes it, the piece will be performed by Alex Henery, the principal double bass player of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, and the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra.  With the goal of bridging the gap between classical music and young people, the composer will also present his earlier works Passacaglia: Secret of Wind and Birds and Internet Symphony Eroica in Shanghai. In Passacaglia, Tan has incorporated the chirping of birds produced by phones. The Internet Symphony Eroica features videos of some 3,000 musicians from more than 70 countries.  7:30 pm, Monday.

The two sides discussed and exchanged opinions on further promoting cultural exchanges and cooperation between China and Guinea, reached a number of consensus, and signed the implementation plan (2018-2021) for their agreement on cultural cooperation between the two governments. Yu Qun reviewed the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation and the fruitful achievements of China-Africa cultural exchanges and cooperation. He said China would like to work with Guinea to carry out the implementation plan (2018-2021) to effectively promote the comprehensive and in-depth development of cultural exchanges and cooperation between the two countries and make new contributions to the development of Sino-Guinean relations. Sow said Guinea highly appreciates the unremitting efforts made by the Chinese Minister of Culture and Tourism to consolidate and develop bilateral friendly relations over a long period of time. Guinea is ready to work with China to actively promote cultural exchanges and cooperation between the two countries and promote mutual understanding and friendship between the two peoples.

1,"China and the United States should promote trade balance by expanding trade volume and pragmatically tackle friction and differences through dialogue and negotiation, Premier Li Keqiang said on Monday. Otherwise, he noted, it will do no good to either country or the international community. Li made the remarks as he spoke to about 100 overseas representatives of Fortune 500 companies, leading research institutions and international organizations as part of the China Development Forum 2018 in Beijing. The three-day forum concluded on Monday. ""China's integration with the world will continue to get deeper,"" Li said, expressing his appreciation to those in attendance, who he sees as ""passionate about China's development"". It was through market forces and business rules that trade volume between China and the US has grown to the current level, which, in essence, has benefited both countries, Li said. He said no winner will emerge from a trade war between the US and China. Closing the door to other countries also blocks a country's own way out, Li said. Noting that 2018 marks the 40th anniversary of China's State policy of reform and opening-up, Li said this year China will open up further and deepen reform, moves that serve China's own interest while facilitating healthy international free trade. China is willing to learn about advanced technologies and management expertise from other countries and expand cooperation with them in areas of products, knowledge, technology and services, he said. The Made In China 2025 strategy is being promoted in an open and fair environment with equal treatment to domestic and overseas businesses, Li said, adding that China will not force any technology transfer from any foreign company. He said China will enhance efforts to protect intellectual property rights while severely cracking down on infringement, extending his welcome to more globally competitive businesses wishing to share growth opportunities. Representatives at the meeting, including Tim Cook, chief executive of Apple Inc, told the premier they are willing to participate in China's reform and opening-up to realize a win-win. General Administration of Customs data show that in 2017, China's trade volume with the US expanded 15.2 percent to 3.95 trillion yuan ($629 billion), and its trade surplus increased 13 percent year-on-year to 1.87 trillion yuan. Zhang Jianping, a professor at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation in the Ministry of Commerce, said China and the US must expand trade volume in general, because the current trade imbalance was not formed overnight and requires structural changes to tackle gradually. Peter Salovey, president of Yale University, said at the forum the key issue between China and the US is to further improve trust and the ability to work together to solve problems. He said he does not want to see a trade deficit ""undermine the great work that our countries have done together on different dimensions in the last two decades""."
1,"GUIYANG - Ten years after US tech giant Apple Inc launched its App Store, the number of Chinese developers tops 2.2 million, and they have become a leading force in app development, said Apple's China chief. ""Chinese app developers are leading the world in terms of app downloads and revenue, and have grown to be a very admirable community of innovators,"" Isabel Ge Mahe (Ge Yue), Apple's vice-president and managing director of Greater China, told Xinhua on the sidelines of the China International Big Data Industry Expo 2019 that opened in Southwest China's Guiyang, Guizhou province, on Sunday. ""Through Apple's App Store, their products have entered the global stage and many of them have become successful cases internationally."" She cited the global success of short video sharing app TikTok, also known as Douyin in China, and the apps developed by China's Palace Museum, as examples of China's innovative ability. TikTok has 75 language versions and is liked by users from over 150 countries and regions, while the 11 apps developed by the Palace Museum have been downloaded by over 5 million users across the world. She said Apple's China team had taken a series of steps to encourage home-grown apps to go global, and used its experience and resources to help promote them to the global market. ""In the area of mobile internet, China has become a spotlight of the world,"" Ge said. ""We are proud to make our contributions to China in this digital age and work with Chinese partners for innovative development in the industry."" Apple has launched four R&D centers in the Chinese cities of Beijing, Shenzhen, Shanghai, and Suzhou, employing a total of over 1,000 people dedicated to innovation in hardware, software and services, Ge said. The Apple China chief also hailed the smooth progress of the construction of Apple's first China data center in Guiyang, adding that Apple had received tremendous support from the local government in the project. Jointly built by Apple and Guizhou-Cloud Big Data Company, the Guizhou facility, with a budget of $1 billion, began construction in March. It will be Apple's third after the data centers in the United States and Denmark. From Feb 28 last year, Apple's iCloud services on the Chinese mainland started to be operated by Guizhou-Cloud Big Data Company, a move Ge said helped provide better services for Chinese Apple users. She reiterated Apple's long-time commitment in protecting users' privacy and data security. ""There is absolutely no so-called backdoor in Apple products,"" said Ge. ""Protecting privacy is our top priority in designing Apple products and services."" Apple has also been an active promoter of using digital technology in bridging the gap in educational resources and aiding China's fight against poverty, according to Ge. In 2018, Apple launched a program to provide digitalized pre-school and vocational education to students in less developed areas in China, with a donation of 25 million yuan ($3.7 million) to the China Development Research Foundation. ""We firmly believe that education is the best way to improve people's livelihoods and tackle inequalities in development,"" Ge said."

Since then, more than 250 pairs of cities in China and Japan have established similar ties, according to the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries. Altogether, about 500 Chinese cities and provinces have established more than 2,570 sister relationships with cities in 136 countries and regions. In March, 1979, Beijing and Tokyo became sister cities. An item on April 21, 1986, from China Daily showed runners from China and Japan participating in a marathon in Beijing to mark the seventh anniversary of the special relationship. In 1980, the Port of Kobe established friendly ties with the Port of Tianjin. Five years later, the Kobe Trade Information Office was established in Tianjin. The cities have focused on business and youth exchanges, as well as cooperation for urban problem solving. In 2008, the first China International Friendship Cities Conference was held in Beijing. It convenes every two years, with the next gathering to be held in Kunming, Yunnan province, next year.

The government should plan well before taking action and make steady efforts in planning construction of the Xiongan New Area, Zhang said after an inspection trip to Xiongan on Saturday.,  Zhang inspected the region's transport network and visited some residential property sales centers, historical heritage sites and the Baiyangdian wetland. He later chaired a meeting on the planning and construction of the new area. On April 1, China announced a plan to create the Xiongan New Area, which spans the counties of Xiongxian, Rongcheng and Anxin in Hebei province and aims to help phase out some non-capital functions from Beijing.,  Zhang called for ""world vision, international standards, Chinese characteristics and high goals"" in planning and construction of the new area. High and unified standards should be used in developing Xiongan's general plan, the regulatory plan for the initial area, as well as specific plans such as Baiyangdian ecological environment protection, Zhang added. Planning work began about one year ago, and now the China Academy of Urban Planning and Design and five other institutions are working on improving Xiongan's general plan and the regulatory plan for the initial area,  If all goes according to plan, the area will have an excellent environment, optimal urban layout, great public services and innovative development.

0,"Xiongan New Area in Hebei province has shut down thousands of polluting companies to curb pollution since it was announced in April. More than 7,200 companies that discharge heavy pollution were investigated and nearly 4,000 of them were closed, according to the area's official account on WeChat, the country's leading social platform. Also, about 100 people involved were arrested, and detained for questioning about actions that might have contaminated the environment. The strong reaction by the authorities illustrates the determination of the area's leaders to tackle environmental problems. Xiongan New Area, established as part of the measures to advance the coordinated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, is required to put environmental safety first and adhere to green development. When it was announced four months ago, one of the goals laid out was to create a ""naturally scenic city with blue skies, fresh air and clean water"". Located about 100 km southwest of downtown Beijing, Xiongan spans Hebei's Xiongxian, Rongcheng, and Anxin counties. It also covers a major wetland in northern China - Baiyangdian Lake, which covers 366 square kilometers and is believed to be a key in improving the area's overall environment. But in the area is Baoding in Hebei province, usually one of the 10 cities with the worst air quality in the country. Baiyangdian's environment has been damaged for years by pollution resulting from fisheries and industrial waste water. To control the pollution, the three counties have taken a series of measures. Hebei Party chief Zhao Kezhi said the area must accelerate the restoration of Baiyangdian and must plant trees on a larger scale in the goal to increase the area's forest coverage rate."

1,"Dallas-based American Airlines, the world's largest by fleet size, said it is constantly reviewing its network and sees possibility to reopen the two flights it suspended last year－flights connecting Chicago and Beijing, as well as Chicago and Shanghai－in the near future, fueled by growing travel demand and the strong performance of its Sino-US flights. The airline said it put the two routes dormant, meaning they have the option to return, and the carrier will review its network strategy and commercial performance. Last year, it put more emphasis on its flights between China and its hubs in Dallas and Los Angeles. American Airlines said it is confident in the China market, as it has seen a growing number of local Chinese fly the airline, including business and leisure travelers, Chinese students studying abroad and their parents who travel to visit them. ""China and the US are the two biggest air transport markets in the world. We think there's enormous potential. We are always reviewing our network and where it makes sense to add new services for our customers, we will,"" said Sam Martin, general manager of Australia and New Zealand operations at American Airlines. ""Over the past five years, we have firmly established ourselves in the Asia-Pacific region and in the China market. Our Asia-Pacific network, of which China is a big part of, is performing better than it has at any time in our history,"" he said. American Airlines operates daily flights from Beijing, Hong Kong and Shanghai, to Los Angeles and Dallas, using its newest airplanes, the company said. The carrier said its commitment to China backs its aim to continue developing its partnership with China Southern Airlines, the biggest airline in Asia. The two sides launched a reciprocal code share agreement last year, followed by reciprocal lounge access and loyalty benefits in 2019. ""With the opening of Beijing Daxing International Airport in 2019 and the ability to cooperate fully with China Southern (which will move to the new airport), we are excited about our future in the Chinese market,"" said Maxine Peng, general manager of American Airlines China. Meanwhile, American Airlines has invested $28 billion in renovating its customer services globally, including purchasing new planes, building new lounges and better in-flight experiences, a record investment in the industry, since it merged with US Airways more than five years ago. ""We have now fitted in-flight Wi-Fi to all our long haul airplanes. Our customers in China told us they want to stay connected with their friends and families while they fly, and we are pleased to provide them with that convenience,"" Peng said. In the past few years, the Sino-US flight market has witnessed double-digit annual growth and now that growth is proceeding to a more stable period.

Under the baton of Raphael Schluesselberg, the Symphonia Vienna New Year's Concert will be staged from Wednesday to Sunday, with a program including Leichte Kavallerie Overture by Franz von Suppe and Aquarellen Waltzer, Op 258 by Josef Strauss. Tang Muhai, who is also the artistic director of the Tianjin Symphony Orchestra, will take up the baton at the concert on Jan 1, in which the National Symphony Orchestra will perform with Chinese-Canadian soprano Zhang Liping and Chinese tenor Shen Yang. Western orchestras, including the London Symphony Orchestra, Hagen Quartet and the Saint Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra will perform at the Tianjin Grand Theater in 2018. Among the most notable changes after the management transition will be the increasing number of shows of traditional Chinese arts, such as Chinese folk music. ""Tianjin is the hometown of traditional Chinese folk arts, and we have a large fan base here,"" says Peking Opera artist Meng Guanglu. Together with a number of Peking Opera artists from Beijing, Meng will perform at the Tianjin theater classic pieces, including Auspicious Dragon and the Phoenix and Yang Silang Visits His Mother.,Beijing Peking Opera Company director Li Zhuoqun and renowned director-actor Guo Baochang will stage a Peking Opera work, titled The Grand Mansion Gate, which is an adaptation of the popular TV series with the same title directed by Guo. Highlighted dance productions will include The Moon Opera by Tianjin native dancer-choreographer Wang Yabin and Winter of Peacock by renowned Chinese dancer-choreographer Yang Liping. Western troupes will bring classic dance productions to Tianjin, including Giselle and Don Quixote by Ballet Company of Teatro alla Scala from Italy, and Swan Lake and La Bayadere by the Mariinsky Ballet from Russia. In terms of theater performances, audiences will see Taiwan director Stan Lai's classic pieces, The Peach Blossom Land and The Village. Opened in 2012, the Tianjin Grand Theater is not just seen as a place for live entertainment, but also as a scenic tourist destination in its own right. It not only attracts audiences from Tianjin but also from Beijing, which is a 30-minute journey away by high-speed train. ""Tianjin has a history of more than 600 years and is known for its unique culture, cuisine and ports. It's not just about coming to see a show. For people living in nearby cities, it's a short vacation hub as well,"" says Guo."
0,"For 10 years in a row, the Beijing Dance Festival has been one of the biggest summer celebrations of contemporary dance in the Chinese capital. Every July, it brings more than 300 dance artists, over 200 dance students and more than 5,000 audience members to Beijing. They come from cities throughout China, the rest of Asia, as well as America, Europe and Africa.  The much-anticipated 2018 edition of the dance festival will raise its curtain on July 19, running through July 31. The two-week event will begin with a dance education week from July 20 to 26, followed by a performance week from July 26 to 31. The education week features an international faculty, with dance masters from countries including China, Germany, Australia, France, Spain, Japan, Russia, the United States and Barbados. In a six-day camp, all enrolled students, professional and amateur alike, will undergo intensive, dynamic training on contemporary dance styles: from techniques and movements to choreography and artistic expressions. The performance week consists of three sections: ""Focus"" presents evening productions from rising stars in the dance scene, including those from Germany, Israel and Taiwan; ""Springboard"" showcases edgy and daring works from the world's creative minds; and ""Youth Dance Marathon"" offers an open platform to all young choreographers to display their original work. It's open to public application online, and registration will close on May 15. The core value of contemporary dance lies in individual personalities; choreography is influenced, however, by cultures in different areas of the world. This year's ""Springboard"" section will feature solos, duets, and troupes from different places to show different understandings of the world through dance. Topics will cover both issues of interest to society and relations among people. Hong Kong's City Contemporary Dance Company, for example, will tell stories of Hong Kong's rebelling triad youngster - culture, and troupes from the western Chinese cities of Yinchuan and Nanning will present choreography with local flairs.,""Talking about modern arts [in the Chinese mainland], people often think of first-tier cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, but in western parts of the country, modern arts are also developing well, although people often consider these places less-developed,"" said Willy Tsao, an organizer of the festival and artistic director with dance company BeijingDance/LDTX, at a media talk in Beijing on Wednesday. He is also a council member for the Chinese Dancers Association. A veteran choreographer and educator in contemporary dance, the Hong Kong-born artist has been dedicated to promoting modern dance in China since the 1980s. More details of the festival will be unveiled at a news conference on June 5. The Beijing Dance Festival was initiated in 2008, and co-presented by BeijingDance/LDTX - a Beijing-based independent modern dance company - and Hong Kong's City Contemporary Dance Company. It's co-organized with the Beijing Tianqiao Performing Arts Center.  The first Beijing Dance Festival invited only six dance troupes, including three foreign ones. Back then, it was a one-week event celebrated among a small group of artists. Since 2012, the festival has expanded to two weeks. Due to its growing popularity and artistic influence in the capital, it has become an annual dance extravaganza, attracting veteran and young choreographers alike, along with dancers from around the world. ""As a pioneer in contemporary dance, the Beijing Dance Festival has gone through 10 years' flourishing development. We received funds for culture and arts from the Beijing municipal government in 2017 and have since then become an official culture brand of the city,"" Tsao said. He said he hopes the festival could be developed into an international cultural phenomenon which could represent Beijing in the global arts arena.,Compared to popular mass culture, contemporary dance is a relatively unfamiliar art form which the general public may find hard to comprehend and appreciate in-depth. Tsao defines the dance form using three major features: self-expression, innovative ideas and understandings of current events in modern society. ""Contemporary dance is niche, even in New York - the birthplace of Western contemporary dance,"" said Tsao. ""But it's also an indispensable part of a diversified metropolis."" ""If different cultures of a society form a pyramid, mass culture is at the bottom, entertaining a large number of people. Contemporary dance is part of the top area,"" he explained. To Tsao, being at the top means more freedom in art creation, and most importantly, the power to lead the development of modern arts. Over the past decade, China has seeing an increasing number of indie groups promoting contemporary dance, Tsao said. ""The market is optimistic. There is a growing number of audience members, especially in Beijing,"" he said. ""These indie groups have served as important platforms to promote the art among the public."" Talking of the future, Tsao said he hopes Chinese contemporary dance could help change the world's understanding of China. ""I want to show the world there are various dance forms in China, not limited to classical dance, folk dance and ballet."""

1,"DALIAN - Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum (WEF), on Monday applauded China's role in driving global economic growth and its commitment to globalization.  ""China's growth is an incredible contribution to the global economy,"" Schwab told Xinhua ahead of the Annual Meeting of the New Champions 2017, also known as Summer Davos.  China's GDP registered a 6.9 percent year on year increase in the first quarter thanks to warming trade and robust consumption, which prompted a number of financial institutions, including the International Monetary Fund, to upgrade their forecast.  ""The Chinese economy has surprised, again, many people as when we were in Tianjin a year ago and two years ago here, there were many skeptics,"" Schwab said, adding that he is optimistic for the global economy as a whole with many areas moving out of recession.  China has served as a major stabilizer and driving force for the world economy, contributing to more than 30 percent of growth during the past years, data showed.  Schwab believes the economy has become more forward-oriented during the past decade that featured with the Summer Davos. Established by the WEF in 2007, the forum is held each year in China, alternating between the port cities of Dalian and Tianjin.  ""The meeting shows that China is not just a traditional economy based on manufacturing but has great potential to move very fast into the era of the fourth industrial revolution,"" Schwab said.  He also highlighted China's efforts to push forward globalization. ""We are living in an inter-connected and inter-dependent world and we need globalization because our fate is interwoven.""  Schwab called for a different form of globalization that can ensure dialogues in a multipolar world and rein in the widening gap between rich and poor. ""We have to made globalization much more inclusive.""  Striving to further integrate into the world economy, China is on a new course with the Belt and Road Initiative. A high-level meeting was held in Beijing last month to rally support for the initiative.  ""The Belt and Road Initiative has great significance because it is a new approach to reach a new and open cooperation...and everybody can participate in a win-win situation as an equal partner,"" Schwab said.  From Tuesday to Thursday, around 1,500 politicians, officials,entrepreneurs, scholars, and media representatives from over 90 countries and regions will assemble in the city to discuss topics from inclusive growth to the new industrial revolution.  The meeting, themed ""Achieving Inclusive Growth in the Fourth Industrial Revolution,"" will focus on how technology and policy innovations can accelerate a more inclusive style of economic growth that prioritizes meaningful job creation and sustainable development.  Premier Li Keqiang will address the opening ceremony on Tuesday.  Schwab founded the WEF in 1971, initially known as the European Management Forum. In 1987, the forum changed to the current name and sought to broaden its vision by focusing on international concerns.  China first sent a delegation to the meeting in 1979, with subsequent participation marked by an incremental and positive assertiveness."
0,"A new exhibition celebrating the Year of the Pig opened to the public at the Capital Museum in Beijing on Tuesday. The first day of Lunar New Year falls on Feb 5 this year. The show, Harmony and Good Harvest, gives glimpses of how the pig has been depicted in Chinese culture through 60 exhibits that illustrate the economic and social aspects of people's association with the animal over time. The pig symbolizes propitiousness and good harvests, and reflects people's yearning for better lives, the show's curator Zheng Hao says. The pig is among the earliest domesticated animals in ancient China and was seen as a symbol of agriculture. The Chinese character jia (home) consists of a common component, baogaitou, which is the upper part of the character that implies a house, and the component shi, the lower part, which refers to pigs. As the composition shows, a settled life with a stable food supply was a major source of happiness for the ancient Chinese. People's opinions of the pig have changed over time. There was a time when people offered pigs as sacrifices to gods and ancestors. Images of pigs often appeared in books or were carved on utensils and used as decorations. However, there was also a time when pigs were perceived as less diligent than cattle and slower than war horses. They were viewed as ""impure and dumb"". The positive view remains mainstream, though. Zhu Bajie, the pig monk from the classic Chinese novel, Journey to the West, has provided an ambivalent image of laziness, gluttony, lust and cowardice mixed with lightheartedness, endurance, loyalty and humor. The figure is indispensable in portraying the pig in Chinese culture, and the exhibition is no exception. Other exhibits include pig figurines made of pottery, porcelain and jade, and royal artifacts with pig motifs.,Some models on display are items that have been unearthed from excavated agricultural sites of the Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 220), such as toilets for humans on top of pigsties. They provide a glimpse of the practical design of ancient livestock rearing. Tomb figures, household items and accessories, as well as modern stamps inspired by the 12 animals of the Chinese zodiac, are also on show, along with interpretations of the related culture. The exhibition runs through March 17. This is the 12th year in a row that the museum is holding a Lunar New Year's exhibition, featuring the animals of the Chinese zodiac, Zheng says. The museum has renewed its permanent exhibitions, including bronze and jade wares, calligraphy and paintings, according to Han Zhanming, the museum's director. Bai Jie, the museum's Party secretary, announced some of the exhibitions under planning for the year at a news conference on Monday. Working together with Beijing's Palace Museum and National Museum of China, as well as the Shanghai Museum, the Liaoning Provincial Museum and the Nanjing Museum in Jiangsu province, the Capital Museum will host an exhibition of more than 100 ancient landscape paintings in September. This year, another exhibition organized through the cooperation of over 20 domestic museums will feature and interpret ancient silk. Exhibits will examine the aesthetics, ritualistic functions and social significance of the fabric. Another key show will open at the end of February, focusing on the historical development of Northwest China's Qinghai province, where plowing and nomadic traditions are rooted. Others will look at the local culture of Ji'an in Jiangxi province and of Zhejiang province in eastern China. The museums will also host exhibitions explaining the culture and history of Beijing's classical gardens, the areas around Xishan Mountain and the Yongding River this year."

The upcoming summit will further promote the integration of China's Belt and Road Initiative with the African Union's Agenda 2063 to enhance mutual benefits, Tavares told China Daily. The minister noted that the Prime Minister of Cape Verde Ulisses Correia e Silva will attend the summit, which will be held in September. ""Africa and China are good friends and sincere partners with a long history of cooperation and mutual support,"" he said, adding that Africa offers huge investment opportunities for Chinese companies and there is vast potential in economic and trade cooperation between the two sides. China and Cape Verde established diplomatic ties in 1976, and Cape Verde has proven to be ""a faithful friend"" of China, Tavares said. China has funded public buildings, such as the presidential and governmental palaces, in the country. ""Chinese investment in key economic sectors, such as infrastructure, industries and tourism, is welcomed as it can promote economic growth,"" he said. Cape Verde has a geostrategic position in the Atlantic Ocean and it might prove to be of great significance in deepening cooperation in the Belt and Road Initiative, he said. Foreign Minister Wang Yi paid a visit to Cape Verde in May. During a meeting with Cape Verde President Jorge Fonseca, Wang said that the two countries are working to push forward cooperation in the fields of infrastructure, marine economy, the development of special economic zones, tourism, renewable energy and human resource development."

The Kulangsu Gallery of Foreign Artifacts from the Palace Museum Collections will be in a former hospital that was set up by a Dutch-American missionary in 1898.  The opening exhibition features 219 artifacts including antique clocks, scientific instruments and paintings from abroad. They come from the 16th to the early 20th century.  The artifacts were chosen from the Palace Museum's collection of some 10,000 foreign artifacts, many of which were brought by missionaries and diplomats to the court of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). Because the museum has lacked a space to present the items, most of those going on display in Xiamen have long been stored in warehouses.  ""The Palace Museum has the responsibility to find a place to show the artifacts to give the public a wider view of the world's civilization,"" said Shan Jixiang, director of the Palace Museum. ""Due to historical reasons, in Western museums, we can see many items from abroad, but such institutions are quite rare in China.""  Gulangyu Island, a top tourist spot once called Kulangsu, hosted the settlements of 13 countries from the mid-19th to the early 20th century, making the 1.88-square-kilometer island a cultural melting pot.

0,"Police and education authorities in Beijing are probing a child abuse case at the Xintiandi branch of RYB Education Kindergarten, a well-known chain of preschools. This is the latest in a number of similar cases reported recently nationwide. Several parents reported to police on Wednesday night that their children, all around 3 years old and enrolled at the company's Xintiandi branch, had needle marks on their bodies and were repeatedly fed unidentified white pills. Police were investigating and collecting evidence. Doctors and forensic experts also are participating, but so far no conclusion could be made, according to the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau. The education commission of Beijing's Chaoyang district, which oversees the kindergarten, said that it also is looking into the case and that three teachers have been suspended. The Ministry of Education has begun a special inspection of the management of kindergartens nationwide and required local education authorities to take effective measures to improve teachers' morality and tighten supervision, according to a ministry release late Thursday. RYB Education Kindergarten was China's largest early years education service provider in annual revenue last year, according to the Frost & Sullivan Report. On Sept 27, RYB Education Inc, the kindergartens' parent company, rang the opening bell on the New York Stock Exchange, indicating it was the first independent enterprise to be listed in the early childhood education field. It's initial public offering was filed the day before. RYB's stock price on the NYSE fell on Wednesday to $26.71 a share, down by $1.02, or 3.68 percent. The NYSE was closed on Thursday for a national holiday. This has been the third reported child abuse case in a month. On Nov 13, Shanghai police detained a person surnamed Zheng who was in charge of a day care center where staff were caught on camera abusing toddlers. Three other staffers were detained, according to Shanghai police. Almost at the same time, Golden Cradle Education and Technology Group, which has more than 700 kindergartens and schools nationwide, also became involved in a similar accusation as parents said teachers at one of its kindergartens in Beijing abused children. Police are investigating, but so far no details have been released."
0,"Beijing authorities released a regulation on preschool education to improve kindergartens' risk control system and their internal management, Beijing Evening News reported. The regulation stipulates that every kindergarten should have a safety officer, who should be trained before taking the post. Children should be accompanied by two teachers at the same time. Video surveillance should cover all public areas in the kindergarten. Teacher's behaviors, such as abuse, discrimination, physical punishment and humiliating children, will be dealt with severely. The regulation sets rules on accident management. On the one hand, public security, education, health and food authorities should share information and eliminate potential safety risks; on the other, an accident report and investigation system will be set up. Once an accident happens in a kindergarten, an emergency plan should be triggered, an investigation will start and the situation will be reported to the public as soon as possible. The regulation also says kindergarten teachers' salaries should be raised and preschool teachers' training and recruiting channels should be broadened."
0,"The invitational exhibition   was held in Beijing on Sept 22. The exhibition was one of the largest of its kind, gathering more than 200 artworks from across the nation. Exhibits include representative pieces from inheritors of colored sculpture and highly rated works from students at art schools, representing different cultural styles. In China, colored sculpture not only influences areas of folk art, but is becoming accepted by more academics, artists and professional scholars. The exhibition was co-organized by the Museum of Chinese Garden and Landscape Architecture and the Colored Sculpture Committee of Chinese Folk Literature and Art Association and co-hosted by several institutions, including the Arts and Design Academy at Beijing University of Technology.,Zhang Chang, a fourth-generation inheritor of Zhang-style clay figurine making, said: ""The times are changing, and people's tastes are also evolving. I think inheritance is not about keeping the traditional arts as is, but creating and innovating on the basis of passing on our excellent tradition."" Colored sculptures by Zhang, including the piece are being shown at the exhibition. Zou Feng, vice-president of the Art and Design Academy of Beijing University of Technology, said: ""This exhibition pulled modern colored sculpture and general audiences closer, to let people understand the art form with more firsthand sensational recognition. We can say this exhibition created an effective link among traditional arts and crafts, modern life and the society."",Furthermore, Zou revealed colored sculpture has already been included in the curriculum at Beijing University of Technology. ""Very few schools still offer colored sculpture as a major by itself. But our teachers and folk artists are all trying very hard to keep and pass on this traditional craft,"" said Huang Tao, secretary of the Party committee at Beijing University of Technology. To that end, he suggested including colored sculpture in introductory courses at art institutions. Duration: Sept 22, 2018 - Jan 6, 2019"

1,"The White House's decision to ""implement a 25 percent tariff on $50 billion of goods from China that contain industrially significant technologies"", made on Friday, is a stark violation of the core spirit of recent trade talks between China and the US and is set to backfire if Washington doesn't back off from its dangerous adventurism. The two sides have achieved substantial results in the recent rounds of dialogue in Washington and Beijing and there have been constructive signs of improving trade relations despite the difficulty to entirely iron out their trade differences in the short term. By issuing the statement of tariff imposition on Friday, however, the Donald Trump administration has once again proved inconsistent and precarious, which will become a major hurdle as the world's two largest economies interact with each other to build a new-type of trade relations. The US' unilateralism has been visible at the recent G7 meeting in Canada and has become a factor of uncertainty for the global efforts to restore global trade order and fight protectionism. What the US should bear in mind is that its unilateral moves will lead to nothing but resolute fighting back from its trade partners, including China. Given the frequent flip-flopping of the Donald Trump administration, it is still too early to conclude that a trade war will start. But China's stance has been consistent: It welcomes dialogue and is not afraid of trade war threats. China has made it clear that it will take ""immediate"" tariff measures of ""equal scale and strength"" right after the statement by the White House was released. Washington should not underestimate China's resoluteness in safeguarding its core interest. The US side should be responsible if, as China has said, all economic and trade outcomes of previous talks fail to take effect thanks to the US' latest decision to impose tariffs on Chinese goods. China as the world's second-largest economy and the largest consumer market has announced and will take substantial moves to further open its economy, which will provide opportunities of development for all other countries, including the US. It will be regrettable if the US companies and workers fail to benefit from China's economic liberalization moves due to Washington's refusal to cast away its adventurism."
0,"Authorities have put the brakes on diesel trucks transporting coal to and from seaports in northern China. It's one of a series of new measures to cut vehicle exhaust emissions, a senior environmental official said on Tuesday.  Since April, only trains are allowed to carry coal to Tianjin Port. Other ports, including Cangzhou and Tangshan ports in Hebei province, will follow suit in September, under an air pollution action plan for the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region.  Before the ban, diesel trucks were making 6,000 to 7,000 journeys a day to Tianjin Port, Liu Bingjiang, head of air pollution control at the Ministry of Environmental Protection, said on Tuesday at the Environmental Protection Industry Innovation and Development Conference.  Emissions from a heavy diesel truck are equal to those of 200 gasoline-powered cars, he said, adding that the move will significantly lower the concentration of PM2.5, fine particulate matter in the air that can harm health.  Diesel trucks make about 2 million trips to deliver around 60 million metric tons of coal a year to Tianjin Port, according to the ministry.  The coal usually comes from Shanxi and Hebei provinces and the Inner Mongolia autonomous region, via Beijing, making the trucks significant polluters of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei regions.  ""It wasn't an easy decision, but we have to push forward despite the huge economic loss if we want to combat air pollution,"" Yuan Yi, manager of the port's logistics company, was quoted as saying by Tianjin Daily.  In April, 16 shipments came to the port by train, up from 10 shipments in March.  In addition to the truck ban, the ministry ""will take tougher measures to control vehicle exhaust emissions, which have contributed more pollutants in recent years,"" Yuan said.  Last year, China had 295 million registered vehicles; and in 15 major cities, including Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai, exhaust emissions contributed between 13.5 percent and 41 percent of all airborne pollutants, according to ministry figures.  About 33 percent of all registered vehicles in China, including trucks and cars, are in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region.  The ministry plans to halt all truck transportation for companies whenever the region issues an emergency warning for air pollution next winter.  It also issued the National VI standard for exhaust emissions - the strictest in the world - which could cut emissions by 90 percent from the National I standard, Liu said.  In addition, along major expressways in the region, new stationary remote-sensing equipment will test moving cars' emission levels by the end of this year, he said."
1,"Come August, Li Kaikai, 8, who lives with his parents in downtown Beijing, will be off to a capital suburb to take part in a five-night, six-day science summer camp where only English will be the medium of communication. The camp will set Li's parents back by 6,680 yuan ($980). It will cover subjects like virtual reality or VR, augmented reality or AR, 3-D printing and architectural design. It will also include social activities like pool-side parties, movies and games. At the end of the camp, Li will be required to make a presentation on what he thinks of the city's future. Using sand, he will need to build and present a model of the city he visualizes. The camp is one of many summer activities Li's parents have earmarked for him for the next two months. Compared with overseas summer camps that require people to travel long distances and afford high prices, domestic summer courses are popular among certain sections of the society, especially working parents. Domestic camps, too, offer various courses with focus on subjects or themes like travel, child-friendly destinations, science, technology, English language and aerospace. MoncyClub, an outdoor child center located at the Olympic Park in north Beijing, has developed a new summer camp this year, its second one since it was established last year. The course includes drama, climbing, safety knowledge and music. It is taught by English-speaking teachers and professional tutors, all experts in one of subjects, said Kuang Xiaoyu, marketing director of the club. ""It's very hard for working parents to find an outdoor camp within the city with a structure designed for them to send in their kids in the morning and pick them up at night,"" she said. Each camp lasts five working days, and takes in no more than 20 children. ""We want to fill the gap in the traditional school education, which only focuses on knowledge rather than experience and practice that we provide here,"" she said. Each camp costs 5,199 yuan upward. There are eight camps in two months. Lin Jialu, a mother of a 7-year-old, sent her son to a military camp in Guangzhou last summer. The children there practised living like real soldiers. For the first time in their life, brats learnt to wash their clothes and clean their rooms."
1,"The 2018 Sino-Foreign Audiovisual Translation and Dubbing Cooperation Workshop opened in Beijing on Tuesday. More than 80 Chinese scholars and film experts, as well as 40 delegates from over 24 countries and regions are taking part, including presidents of film festivals, audiovisual agency principals, and translators. Over the five-day event themed  the participants will discuss ways to strengthen international cooperation and peer relationships in the field, as well as promote deeper international understanding of Chinese films and TV dramas, and seek deeper cooperation in dubbing. This year's workshop consists of two sessions: one held during this month's Beijing International Film Festival and the other during the Shanghai International Film Festival in June.,""2018 marks the 40th anniversary of China's reform and opening-up, which is also a chance for Chinese filmmakers and artists to review their achievements, and communicate with the world with more opened hearts."" said Zhu Qi, deputy director of the Bureau for External Cultural Relations, Ministry of Culture and Tourism, at the opening ceremony. ""This workshop provides a high-level, reliable communication platform to serve such purposes, and could promote in-depth exchanges to facilitate mutual understanding,"" Zhu said.,""China has entered a new era of development, which provides new chances for the Chinese cultural industry. China leads in the number of films and television production, and has the biggest viewing population in the world,"" said Ma Li, director of international cooperation department of State Administration of Radio and Television. Li Zuowen, dean of School of International Studies of Communication University of China, said the university will continue its advantages in audiovisual translation education and do research to make greater contributions to the international cultural exchanges. The workshop, sponsored by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, and the State Administration of Radio and Television, has been held annually since 2015. It's co-hosted by the Communication University of China and Chinese Culture Translation and Studies Support Network, and supported by the Organizing Committee of the Beijing International Film Festival.

0,"Traditional Chinese arts and crafts are being presented through a dance drama by the Beijing Dance Academy that is now touring Europe. Fen Mo (When Painting Comes Alive), the dance drama, is being staged in nine cities in five countries from Jan 17 at venues ranging from the National Theater of Novi Sad, Serbia, to the Palace of Arts (MUPA) of Budapest in Hungary. The dance drama premiered at the Tianqiao Theater in Beijing in 2009. It features 31 students from the Beijing dance school, all of whom major in traditional Chinese dance. The Europe tour ends on Tuesday. Consisting of five chapters, Fen Mo has borrowed elements from traditional Chinese culture, such as Peking Opera, ink painting, paper art and tai chi, to display the beauty of Chinese paintings in particular. So far, the dance drama has attracted more than 5,000 audience members during its ongoing tour. According to Pang Dan, director of the traditional Chinese dance department at the Beijing Dance Academy, the tour is the school's first such large-scale presentation in Europe. ""We are trying to break with conventional storytelling in dance dramas. With Fen Mo, we use symbols that represent traditional Chinese culture to communicate with the audience,"" says Pang, who is also one of the choreographers of the dance drama. Fen Mo was revised in 2016 to celebrate the 55th anniversary of the founding of the dance school. Pang says traditional Chinese dance was set up as a subject to research and teach at the school more than 60 years ago. The evolution of traditional Chinese dance has been a major subject there. Fen Mo was born as an attempt to show its direction. Dong Jiaming performs one of the five chapters, titled Dan. In the chapter, he finishes a pas de deux with a female dancer, portraying a rain scene with paper umbrellas. ""Chinese elements are displayed in the dance in an abstract way. We use our movements, especially our breathing, to showcase traditional Chinese painting, which is poetic and rhythmical,"" says Dong. The 21-year-old will graduate from the Beijing Dance Academy this summer. He was born and grew up in Jiaozuo, Henan province, and was enrolled in the affiliated school of the Beijing Dance Academy at 11 years old. The European tour of the dance drama is part of the official Happy Chinese New Year program. Organized by the Ministry of Culture in 2010, the program covers about 400 cities in 130 countries. Spring Festival, which is celebrated as China's biggest annual holiday, is being embraced by more countries as an occasion to participate in festivities and as a way to experience Chinese culture in general."
0,"Beijing plans to launch the second phase of its sub-center construction in the northeastern Tongzhou district and build a comprehensive transportation hub, after key municipal organs moved to its new offices in the sub-center, a senior official said on Monday. The capital aimed to construct and design a high quality and eco-friendly city sub-center, said Chen Jining, mayor of Beijing, during the opening ceremony of the second session of the 15th Beijing People’s Congress. “The landscape project will be thoroughly carried out in Tongzhou district to establish a better canal business zone,” he said. He added a number of public service projects, including the sub-center theater, libraries and museums, will start construction and the old town in Tongzhou district will conduct ecological restoration to better protect its environment and complete urban repairs. Border areas of the capital and Langfang, a city in neighboring Hebei province, will also be strengthened to better promote coordinated development in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. The overall construction of the sub-center is steadily progressing, said Tan Xuxiang, director of the city’s reform and development commission. “We are working on 235 major projects in 2019, with 136 under construction,” he said. “A total of 75 billion yuan had completed investment.” Zhao Lei, director of the Tongzhou district and also a deputy to the congress, said the district had completed 19 projects this year and the green space as well as waters of the sub-center will be substantially increased to achieve harmonic coexistence for water and urban areas. By 2035, the green space in the city’s sub-center will reach 41 square kilometers, with forest coverage rate achieving 100 percent. A system to control water pollution and ensure safety through flood control facilities is also expected to be established in the city’s sub-center."
1,"BEIJING - A Beijing district court said Sunday the British Broadcasting Company had filed a lawsuit against a Chinese company for using its name to promote an English learning app. The trademark infringement lawsuit, announced by a Haidian district court, accused iYuba, a Beijing-based language learning firm, of using BBC's trademark and content on its apps, websites and social media without any authorization. The BBC is seeking 500,000 yuan ($78,950) in compensation and asked the company to cease infringing on its trademark registered in China. The BBC claimed that it had sent letters to ask iYuba to remove its brand name from content and messages, and the Chinese company has yet to respond. According to the court notice, the BBC has registered nearly 400 trademarks in China since the 1980s, 60 of which contain ""BBC."" Established in 2012, the Beijing-based company aims to build an online platform for people to learn English."
1,"The service sector, IT and media industries have overtaken the education industry as major job sources for expats in China, according to figures from the 2019 Job Fair for Foreigners in Beijing. The job fair was organized on Sunday by the Foreign Talent Research Center and the State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs, attracting more than 500 expats with nearly 1,000 jobs available in a range of professions. The expat job market, once dominated by language teachers, has seen a major shift. Approximately half the jobs available at the fair were in the sales, media, marketing and IT sectors, including openings for journalists, brand and communication managers and software engineers. ""A certain level of Mandarin proficiency is an advantage,"" said Yang Jiayin, project manager of the research center. ""The best-paying jobs generally require the ability to speak Mandarin. Positions that require fluent spoken and written Mandarin tend to pay more than the same jobs without the language requirement."" Oasis Games, a publisher of interactive games, has participated in the Beijing job fair for foreigners since 2013. The company translates Chinese games into 16 foreign languages, with 200 million people playing them in 130 countries. Ai Xuan, the company's human resources representative, said many Chinese companies are striving for a bigger share of the international market and are looking for expats with Chinese language proficiency and those who understand Chinese culture. She said most of the company's foreign staff are freshmen who learned Mandarin at Chinese universities through exchange programs. The annual salary for such staff is about 180,000 yuan ($26,850) a year. According to the research center's Yang, the income gap between expats and Chinese employees in the same positions has been reduced in past decades. Yang said the annual salary of a foreign employee would be five to 10 times higher than that of a Chinese employee in the 2000s. The gap is narrower now－about two to three times－partly because salaries paid to Chinese have risen faster than expat salaries. Statistics from the State administration also showed that China has attracted expats from European and Asian countries because of its rapid economic growth and a widening range of opportunities. Data collected from the previous 10 years at the Beijing job fair showed that more than 50 percent of job seekers are from European countries, with a majority from Spain and Portugal, while about 25 percent are from Asian countries, with a majority from India. Khan Ghulam, a 32-year-old Pakistani software engineer, has been working for a China-US joint venture for two years. He attended the fair to find a higher-paying job in a Chinese startup. ""China has a promising future with its growing power in the international society, and it gives young people more opportunities, which I believe will attract lots of job seekers abroad,"" he said. Last year, China issued about 336,000 work permits to foreigners. China had a total of more than 950,000 expats working in the country as of the end of last year, according to the administration. By comparison, there were only 180,000 foreign workers employed in China in 1996. The increasing number of expats working in China has also boosted related services targeting foreigners. ""As more expats seek jobs in China, many find difficulty in maintaining their dietary habits. Finding a restaurant serving familiar food and getting fast food delivery services are two major problems,"" said Liu Chao, marketing director of an online bilingual food delivery company called Sherpa's, which now has 100,000 foreign customers. ""Expats are an emerging consumption group with great potential. China holds great charm for foreign expats, but they'll stay here longer only with more life conveniences,"" he said."
0,"Last month, I was assigned to Kongpo'gyada county, Tibet autonomous region, on a two-day medical assistance program. It was the first time I had traveled to Tibet as a volunteer doctor, but it was easy to identify the most common illnesses just by observing people. The so-called plateau redness - the Tibetans' rosy cheeks - could indicate thickening of the heart muscles as a result of long exposure to low levels of oxygen. Also, I frequently saw adults wobble slightly while walking, as if shifting their center of weight from one side to the other, which suggested severe pelvic arthritis. After working at the county-level hospital for two days, I realized that the gap in the healthcare sector is still quite large between Kongpo'gyada and Beijing, where I work most of the time For instance, the county-level hospital only has 30 beds to accommodate all types of patients, but at my hospital in Beijing, every department has about 40 beds. Another concern is poor health awareness. A large number of patients were unwilling to take medical tests, or they bought medication they knew little about, in an attempt to avoid hassle as much as possible. My field of expertise is kidney disease, and during the two day visit, I saw five people who had kidney stones. Though their conditions were critical, they came with a simple purpose; to obtain analgesics so they wouldn't feel any pain. Given the current situation, I believe that campaigns to promote health awareness are extremely important. The most effective way would be to launch educational campaigns or talks in smaller towns and villages that are out of touch with modern medical networks. Equally important is that more of the region's grassroots medical workers should be sent to Beijing for training. Ultimately, local medics are a sustainable, driving force that could forge Tibet's fragmented medical services into a complete network in the long run."
0,"While roller skates are often seen on China's public squares, few associate them with long-distance travel. But two men - both in their third year at Jining University in Jining, Shandong province - spent five and a half days of the National Day holiday on roller skates, traveling 567 kilometers to Beijing.  Xing Jiarui and Men Dengqiang started their journey on Oct 1, carrying basics such as clothes, food, water and spare parts. They stopped overnight at small hotels, according to a Beijing Youth Daily report, and arrived in the capital on Oct 6.  The pair declined to comment when contacted by China Daily on Tuesday. However, Xing told Chengdu Evening News earlier: ""We skated all the way, except a few places, one of which was a bridge with gravel over the Yellow River. Gravel makes it hard to skate.""  It was a tough journey - eight hours a day on skates. They had worn out more than 10 sets of bearings by the time they reached Beijing.  ""Conditions like muddy roads hurt our feet. Sometimes we couldn't skate,"" Xing told Beijing Youth Daily. ""After a day of skating, our feet hurt at night but felt a little better in the morning.""  Xing said he met Men at the university's roller-skating club and found they shared a dream of a long-distance trip. The National Day holiday seemed to be perfect timing to fulfill the dream, he was quoted as saying.  According to Chengdu Evening News, the two skaters prepared for the trip through physical training. Their regimen included skating more than 10 km every day for two weeks.  The men visited several attractions in Beijing, including Tian'anmen Square, National Stadium and a large square for skating nearby.  ""The 567-km trip, which required persistence, made our National Day holiday quite meaningful. Once we decided to do it, we determined to try our best and not give up no matter how much trouble we encountered,"" Xing was quoted as saying.  On Oct 7, the two men posted photos of the journey on Sina Weibo, arousing public attention that was expressed in both praise and worry.  Some netizens expressed admiration; others said the skating could cause traffic accidents and violated traffic rules. The Beijing traffic police said roller skating should not be done on roads, and violators can face fines.  Jiang Chenglong contributed to this story."
0,"The centuries-old art form of pingshu, or storytelling, is making a welcome return to television after a long hiatus. Xu Fan reports.  One desk and one folded fan was all that consisted for the props used by pingshu (storytelling) master Tian Lianyuan to bring to life a battlefield story from Yang Jia Jiang (Generals of the Yang Family), an influential novel based on the titular legendary family in the Northern Song Dynasty (960-1127) era.  Although Tian is 76 years old, he delivered his dialogue with power and performed with emotion.  When the plot rose to its climax - where a warrior on horseback wields his sword as he rides toward his enemy - he abruptly kicked his leg high to mimic the role's martial   skills.  The stunt drew ovations from the audience, who watched the performance at the headquarters of one of the country's biggest broadcasters, Beijing TV, on Nov 22.  Alongside well-known pingshu artists Lian Liru and Liu Lanfang, Tian was shooting Beijing Pingshu Dahui (Assembly of Pingshu Artists in Beijing), a program showcasing the artists' storytelling performances.  The 25-minute program started to air on Nov 28 on Beijing Satellite TV, and is scheduled to be broadcast every morning from Tuesday to Friday.  Pingshu is a traditional art form that usually sees a performer wrapped in a Chinese-  gown recount a legend through dialogue and exaggerated gestures. Most of the stories are adapted from classic novels penned by ancient authors.      Once limited to audiences on street corners or  houses, pingshu gained unprecedented popularity from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, thanks to a number of programs that ran on television and radio, the dominant entertainment platforms at the time.  As a pioneer to usher in the ""golden decade"", Tian was the first person to appear on television screens and perform pingshu on a show run by Liaoning TV, the provincial broadcaster, in 1985. He is also the first pingshu artist to wear a suit instead of a traditional gown.  On the Liaoning TV shows, he was telling the stories of Yang Jia Jiang, the classic novel penned by Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) author Xiong Damu. To make the traditional art form more intriguing to modern audiences, Tian explored ways to innovate.  ""A traditional pingshu show lasts for two hours. The first 30 minutes act as a prologue and the plot twists appear in the following 90 minutes. But that would not work for a television show. It's too slow. Audiences would switch to another channel,"" explains Tian.  As Liaoning TV limited Tian to 20 minutes per episode, he rewrote the scripts, cut the introduction to three minutes, and added stunts to spark the audience's imagination.  ""In the past, pingshu was an art form to be listened to. But since television has popularized it, it has become more of an art form to be watched,"" adds Tian.  Propelled by the success of Tian's shows, one of the highly-rated TV programs of the time, more than 20 television stations - including the country's most-watched broadcaster CCTV - produced similar shows, prompting pingshu to rise to the peak of its popularity.  But the glory faded after the mid-1990s, due to falling production standards and the rise of television dramas. Over the past decade, pingshu programs have almost disappeared from TV screens.  In 2008, pingshu was inscribed in China's national   list, putting it back in the spotlight. The rapid growth and popularity of the internet has helped pingshu to reach more audiences through online video clips.  Now with Beijing Pingshu Dahui, the centuries-old art form has made a return to television screens after a decadelong break, and may witness a revival, says Tian, with an excited gleam in his eye.  Tian's forum on Baidu Tieba, a popular online community, currently has 4,160 followers who have written 38,000 posts.  But the humble artist says: ""I am old. The future is in the hands of the youngsters.""  Besides, Tian says he has yet to completely recover from a terrible car accident three years ago, which caused the death of his son and severely injured him.  When the Beijing program's producers called him, Tian was initially reluctant to join the show. He didn't give it the nod until the TV company persuaded him with a powerful reason: His reputation could help to revive the art form.  ""China's television industry now has some shallow, mass-market entertainment productions. I hope the younger generations can learn more about traditional culture and benefit from its legacy,"" he says.  Tian also mentions  winner of the Nobel prize in literature who once revealed that his childhood hobby of listening to pingshu opened up his imagination and encouraged him to start writing.  ""Pingshu dates back more than 2,000 years. From the emperors' courts to public areas, it has influenced generations. It's our duty to publicize this unique art form created by the Chinese,"" says Tian.  Speaking about the future, Tian recalls his visits to perform pingshu in Canada and Russia, which he describes as inspirational.  ""I saw some foreigners sitting among the audiences. It convinced me that this Chinese art form could also appeal beyond borders,"" he says.  ""I am too old to learn English. But if the young performers can speak English fluently, I believe pingshu will be enjoyed more in the West."""

0,"A female passenger has sued a local railway authority for allowing passengers to smoke on trains, and a railway transport court held a hearing Wednesday on the case. The Beijing Railway Transport Court held the hearing for a female passenger surnamed Li suing Harbin Railway Bureau. Li was traveling June 9 from Beijing to Tianjin on train K1301 operated by Harbin Railway Bureau when she noticed lots of passengers smoking between the two carriages, though the company's safety tips clearly state that smoking is banned everywhere on the train. After filing a series of complaints that generated no useful response, Li decided to sue, demanding compensation for her ticket, valued at 102.5 yuan ($13), her legal expenses, and 1 yuan as compensation for her mental suffering. She also demanded that the Harbin Railway Bureau issue a smoking ban on train K1301 - which is not a high-speed train - as well as on the platforms of the Beijing and Tianjin railway stations, in addition to removing the smoking areas and ashtrays. In the court, the defendant argued that the case was a dispute of transportation contract in name only and was essentially a public interest lawsuit. It demanded the court dismiss Li's request since her claim did not meet the conditions in each case. Harbin Railway Bureau believed that it had fulfilled its contract obligations as the passenger was transported to her destination safely. Setting up smoking areas and ashtrays is a humanized management measure instead of a violation of law. ""The complete ban of smoking on regular trains that often take 30 hours to finish a journey is unrealistic, "" according to a Harbin Railway Bureau agent. ""Otherwise some people would smoke in the carriages, which is much more dangerous."""
0,"Socheat Chea, a Cambodian student with big dreams, wouldn't attract much attention if he walked down a street in his country since he doesn't talk a lot and is a bit shy around strangers. His classmate, Edgar Moreno Pena, who is from Venezuela, is more adept at socializing. He has a vocabulary of more than 200 Chinese words, tells shopkeepers on Beijing streets pianyidian (give me a bigger discount) and uses Chinese-language food-delivery apps on his mobile phone. ""I often do shopping at Taobao and JD,"" he said, referring to China's two most popular online shopping websites. Although the two foreign students have few similarities in their personal backgrounds, they share a common goal at the Shenzhou Institute in northern Beijing: They are trying to learn from Chinese teachers how to design, build, operate and maintain satellites. Such a personal goal can be seen, to a certain extent, as a microcosm of the national aspirations of both of their countries to gain a place in the global space arena via the cooperation and assistance of China. Chea and Moreno Pena are part of a training program hosted by the China Academy of Space Technology. The idea is to train a small group of elite foreign students to become space industry engineers capable of developing and manufacturing satellites on their own, thus enabling their countries to build their respective space industries and explore space. Eight people are taking part in the program, which began in March 2018－two Venezuelans, two Pakistanis, one Cambodian, one Russian, one Belarusian and one Kazakh. ""I am the first-ever Cambodian studying spacecraft knowledge,"" Chea told China Daily recently at the Shenzhou Institute, which is run by the academy. ""Cambodia is working with China to launch our first satellite in 2021, so the (Cambodian) government hoped that someone could learn something about spacecraft. But there is no school in Cambodia that teaches such a thing. So here I am,"" Chea said. China has signed an agreement with Cambodia to develop, make and launch the Southeastern Asian nation's first satellite in the next few years. The satellite, Techo 1, will be used for communications. Moreno Pena, on the other hand, has 11 years' experience at the Bolivarian Agency for Space Activities, Venezuela's space organization, as an electrical engineer and chief of the spacecraft operation unit. This is the second time he has come to China as a student. The first time was in 2007, when he was selected to take part in satellite application training in Beijing. He said he came to China this time hoping to expand his knowhow on spacecraft and learn how to design and build satellites. ""All of my knowledge and expertise in the space field was about ground operations, such as telemetry, tracking and command of spacecraft. ""I want to study satellites. I want to learn and work on communications satellites operating in low Earth orbit, because now we have a communications satellite in geosynchronous orbit, and remote-sensing satellites in low Earth orbit,"" he said. ""I want to learn how to combine these technologies and do some research here in Beijing, so when I come back to my country I can help to develop our own satellite technology,"" he added. Each of Venezuela's three satellites－one communication and two remote-sensing satellites－was designed, built and launched by China. The Beijing-based China Academy of Space Technology, a subsidiary of State-owned space giant China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp, is a major developer of satellites and spaceships in China. Li Qiang, director of the Shenzhou Institute's postgraduate department, said China has trained hundreds of foreign space engineers since the mid-1990s. However, those training sessions were mostly occasional, often accompanied a satellite export deal, and were mainly focused on ground-based control and applications of satellites rather than their design and production, the director said. ""However, in recent years, along with the expansion in our cooperation in the space industry with other countries, many of our foreign partners voiced their hopes that we could hold some sort of systematic training programs to help them create their own spacecraft designers and technicians,"" he said. Therefore, he said, ""We decided to open a two-year postgraduate program and then sent the message to countries having space cooperation with China."" Some of those countries selected and submitted their candidates to the space technology academy, which then reviewed their qualifications and selected who would be admitted. ""Whether the candidates can get this opportunity depends on two factors. First, their English proficiency is supposed to be good enough to handle our courses－all of them are taught in English,"" Li said. ""And second, an ideal candidate should have at least a bachelor's degree as well as background in or some knowledge of the space industry."" Candidates who pass the qualification screening are also required to write a research proposal and provide an endorsement document signed by the space authority of their nation, he said. Li said the program does not charge the students or their countries any fees. Instead, the Shenzhou Institute gives each student 3,000 yuan ($445) per month as a stipend. Cui Yufu, a senior designer of small satellites at the academy and a professor at the institute, said the program has some advantages that other domestic and foreign space organizations don't offer. ""Our program features opportunities for students to experience what is it like in real satellite development projects,"" Cui said. ""We will ask the students to set up a project team to simulate research and development of an imaginary satellite, and each of them will be designated a role ranging from chief designer to subsystem manager,"" Cui added. ""We also offer opportunities to the students to visit satellite research-related institutes and satellite users to see satellites' assembly, testing and experiments,"" Cui said. ""They will be able to get personal understanding of spacecraft research and development and obtain some know-how."" He said space training providers in other countries will not take foreign students to design or production sites. Cui said most of the lecturers in the program are senior researchers and chief designers at Chinese space institutes and provide the foreign students with the latest expertise. In addition, the institute will invite foreign experts to give lectures to the students to provide access to new developments in the international space sector. ""We want to make sure that they will be able to design satellites when they complete their study here and go back to their countries,"" Cui said. He added that compared with their Chinese peers, the foreign students are more active in class and are better at asking questions and sharing their thoughts. The foreign students will choose either remote sensing or communications satellites as the topic for individual research at the Shenzhou Institute, Cui said, adding that their choice will depend on what they will do in their homeland after the program. Wang Jie, the mentor of the eight-student class, said that in addition to professional knowledge and on-site tours, the institute also arranges lectures on Chinese language and culture for the foreign students and takes them to such historical sites as the Forbidden City and Summer Palace. It also arranges for Chinese students at the institute to communicate with the foreigners to help them improve their ability to speak Chinese, he said. For Chea, the student from Cambodia, studying at the institute has been difficult since the beginning. ""I majored in telecommunications in my university, so I knew nothing about spacecraft. For me, all the courses here are very difficult. At first I didn't understand anything of what our teachers were talking about in class,"" he said. He said he feels lucky because the Chinese teachers are nice and considerate. They have been trying their best to make the lectures easier for him to comprehend, he said. ""Now I can understand much of the content in our courses,"" Chea said. Moreno Pena, the Venezuela student, said he truly treasures the opportunity to learn from his Chinese teachers. ""All the professors here at the institute have not only theoretical knowledge, but also very good and deep experience in different types of satellites. For example, Professor Hu was part of China's own satellite program from the very beginning, and Professor Cui has taken part in both of my nation's remote-sensing satellite projects. ""All of them have at least 10 years of experience in satellite research and development. This is very important and very unique,"" he added. Moreno Pena said China is special to him, professionally as well as personally. ""I met my wife during my first training in Beijing in 2007. She was also a Venezuelan studying spacecraft here at that time,"" he said. ""China is a very special nation to me. I've made a lot of Chinese friends. I love Chinese food in all flavors, especially Beijing roast duck, noodles and local Muslim food,"" he added. Hu Qizheng, a professor at the institute who teaches fundamentals of the space industry, said Chinese teachers are exploring approaches that are appropriate for instructing foreign students. ""Some of the students have work experience in the space sector because their countries have satellites, while others don't have such experience and know virtually nothing about space activities,"" he said. ""So we have been working to figure out an appropriate teaching schedule and to make sure everyone's individual needs can be taken care of."" The students' first year at the institute was focused on basic knowledge about space programs, while in the second year each of them will be given a detailed topic for research, Hu said. Teaching materials given to the foreign trainees were modified from those prepared for Chinese students, while teachers are making textbooks specifically edited for foreign learners, the professor said. Li said enrollment work has begun for the class of 2019. ""So far, eight nations－Venezuela, Bolivia, Algeria, Egypt, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Cambodia－have applied for places for some 20 candidates."" Cui, meanwhile, said he looks forward to collaborating with his foreign students in the future. ""I am convinced that some of the students will become our partners in the future. Actually, the former director of the Venezuelan space agency was one of the trainees here at the institute. ""So by teaching them, we are promoting not only spacecraft knowledge, but also China's space industry standards."""

From the exquisite torch used at the 2014 Nanjing Youth Olympics to the fancy cycling helmets painted with Peking opera masks worn by Chinese track cyclists at the 2016 Rio Olympics, items on display at an exhibition in Beijing on Monday triggered oohs and ahhs from visitors flocking to the show to review China's social and economic achievements over the past five years. Some high-profile athletes attended the show at the Beijing Exhibition Hall, recalling their own highlight moments while learning about the progress their country achieved in other fields. ""I feel really thrilled to learn how much our country has developed in so many areas, not only in sports, with such a concrete presentation of items, illustrations and models,"" said Dong Dong, China's Olympic and world champion trampoline athlete. ""The sense of national pride just encourages you to work harder in whatever you do individually."" Dong was among a whopping 1,000 members of a sports delegation who visited the exhibition, Five Years of Sheer Endeavor, on Monday. It opened on Sept 25. The country's State-run sports system deserves credit for the momentum of scientific innovation that has brought a technology-centered approach to sports development at both the elite and grassroots levels, Dong said. ""The progress in our talent-development system, which now combines all relevant sciences, is really remarkable,"" the 28-year-old veteran said. World champion table tennis star Fan Zhendong said the inspiration he felt at the exhibit was a morale boost that will help him win more titles and actively promote sports off the stage. ""Since the top leadership in our country attaches so much importance to sports development, we as front-runners in the business need to shoulder more responsibility for spreading the positive energy of sports participation to the public,"" said Fan, who won his first world title when he was 17 years old in May 2014. He was one of China's youngest athletes to do so. Among the sports delegates was the new coach of the Chinese women's national handball team, Jesper Holmris of Denmark, who was enthusiastic about many of the exhibits. ""It's interesting to be here to see how fast the development has been going on in China, which is amazing,"" said Holmris, who last visited China 20 years ago. ""This is like a team-building experience for us, coming from Scandinavian culture to learn about what's going on in general in China. It will help us better understand the culture and do our job in sports,"" he said."
0,"Beijing will used facial recognition technology to crack down on hospital scalpers, subjecting them to detention and social credit restrictions, the municipal health authority announced on Friday. The municipal Health Commission said about 30 hospitals in the capital have collected visual information on 2,100 suspected hospital scalpers and entered it into their facial recognition systems. The information on the scalpers-many of whom have been fined by the police-includes photographs and ID numbers. If they enter a hospital, they will be monitored. The city government said the commission will take strict steps this year to publish the names of such scalpers and ban them from taking high-speed trains or flights, registering companies or applying for bank loans. Over 900 such scalpers were detained last year during a citywide crackdown. The commission has cooperated with the city's public security bureau to further identify suspected scalpers, and now, with the new technology, an alarm will be triggered if one enters a hospital. The authorities have also strengthened efforts to prevent any cheating on hospital registration apps by severing connections between commercial apps and hospital registration platforms. China has for years been working to address the issue of hospital scalpers. Commonly known as  or yellow bulls, scalpers book appointments in bulk at major public hospitals, preventing genuine patients from doing so. Then they illegally sell the appointments at inflated prices. Those unwilling to pay typically face lengthy hospital waits, potentially putting lives at risk. Huang Xiaojuan, 32, a resident of Beijing, said she could not register at a well-known maternity hospital when she found herself pregnant last year. Her husband found a scalper online and bought a ticket for 3,000 yuan ($447), even though the normal value would be about 200 yuan. ""The scalper traded with my husband in the backyard of the hospital and told him that he could register with any doctor in the hospital if we were willing to pay a higher price,"" Huang said. ""They have a group with several people in charge of different tasks. Some talk to patients like us; some are in charge of relations with doctors and some are just handling the money. They also hire people to line up in front of registration windows if they cannot reach the doctor directly."" In 2016, Beijing police arrested 12 people for scalping hospital appointment tickets. Many hospitals have set up their own apps for registration to help to reduce scalping. A doctor at Peking University Hospital of Stomatology, who asked not to be named, said there have been virtually no scalpers at the hospital since its app was launched, and most patients choose to register via the app. ""Medical resources are limited,"" the doctor said. ""The app can ensure some equity, since many patients find it hard to register at the window."" Zhang He, a lawyer at B&D Law Firm in Beijing, said hospital scalpers should face severe punishment and hospitals needed to strengthen their management to prevent the practice."
1,"The Ministry of Commerce will accelerate the implementation of opening-up measures that President Xi Jinping pledged at the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2018 and seek enhanced cooperation with Belt and Road economies and international organizations, a top official said on Thursday. Vice-Minister of Commerce Qian Keming made the remarks at the Belt & Road Trade and Investment Forum in Beijing, echoing President Xi's promise on Tuesday about advancing the building of a community with a shared future for humankind. China will ramp up efforts to develop e-commerce in countries and regions participating in the Belt and Road Initiative, and help related economies integrate into globalization, Qian said. China will also boost regional economic cooperation and promote free trade areas, Qian said. ""We will set up high-standard FTAs with countries and regions that have the willingness to do so,"" Qian added. Between 2013 and 2017, trade between China and Belt and Road economies totaled more than $5 trillion, and outbound direct investment exceeded $70 billion, according to the ministry. To further promote the initiative, China and the International Monetary Fund launched the China-IMF Capacity Development Center in Beijing on Thursday. The center will offer training courses for Belt and Road economies including China, according to a statement from the People's Bank of China. ""The Belt and Road Initiative can serve as a powerful platform for economic growth and regional cooperation, involving more than 4 billion people living in Asia, Europe and Africa,"" said United Nations Resident Coordinator Nicholas Rosellini. ""Inclusiveness and win-win outcomes, at the core of the initiative, have to be proactively integrated in the BRI outcomes,"" he said at the 2018 High-Level Policy Forum on Global Governance in Guangzhou. ""The initiative will aim not only to contribute to the achievement of the goals of participating economies in the areas of basic infrastructure, regional development, connectivity and industrialization, but also extend and upgrade the initiative to explicitly aim for a sustainable transformation of the economies along the initiative with poverty reduction, environmental sustainability and inclusive social development at its core, key elements for the success of the initiative in the long-term."" He also noted that there are common barriers to achieving the aims of the BRI, such as a lack of understanding of the investing countries' priorities, policies and regulations, communication barriers due to the cultural differences, and barriers due to environmental and social concerns."
0,"BEIJING - A total of 197 million people took part in winter tourism from November 2017 to March 2018, according to an annual report released by the China Tourism Academy recently. Winter tourism refers to tourist activities related to ice and snow. The cost associated with winter tourism has been decreasing while the public shows increasing interest in participating, said Han Yuanjun, editor-in-chief of the report. Winter tourism is conducive to rural vitalization and local economic transformation, the report said. Winter tourism has been booming in China since Beijing won its bid in 2015 to host the 2022 Winter Olympic Games. Local governments of Beijing and the provinces of Hebei, Jilin and Heilongjiang have unveiled policies to promote winter tourism."

The Dubai government-controlled airline said the move will increase capacity to both Beijing and Shanghai, ""offering Emirates passengers even more seamless A380-to-A380 connections between the two Chinese cities and over 30 international points.""  This upgrade strengthens Emirates' overall mainland China offering, which also includes services to Guangzhou, Yinchuan and Zhengzhou, said the carrier.  The additional seats on the routes will support more business and leisure travel departing from and arriving in China, while offering passengers an exceptional global travel experience.  The Emirates A380 ""Superjumbo"" offers up to 519 seats in a three class configuration on Chinese routes. Earlier last month, Emirates Airline Chairman and CEO Sheikh Ahmed Bin Saeed Al-Maktoum said the carrier aims to expand its network in China within the next 12 months.  ""We are looking at the Chinese market to expand our operations there as we are convinced of China's growth prospects in relation to passenger demand,"" said Sheikh Ahmed.  According to the official Dubai Tourism authority, among Dubai's top 20 source markets for inbound tourism during the first three months of 2017, ""China continued to top the growth trajectory charts with unparalleled 64 percent increase over the first quarter in 2016, delivering 230,000 tourists.""  Since the end of 2016, Chinese tourists can obtain a ""visa on arrival"" at UAE international airports."
0,"Beijing will take further action to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity if Taiwan separatists continue to carry out secession activities, a senior mainland official warned on Wednesday in Beijing following recent military drills in the Taiwan Straits. Ma Xiaoguang, spokesman for the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office, spoke in response to a question during a news conference about whether ""military force for reunification"" should be employed. ""The recent live-fire drills carried out by the People's Liberation Army have sent an explicit and clear message－we aim to pursue peaceful reunification with sincerity and great efforts, but we have the resolve, the confidence and the ability to defeat secessionist attempts in any form, to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" Ma said. Last week, the PLA Ground Force and Air Force conducted live-fire exercises and several training operations in the Taiwan Straits. Ma said the drills targeted a ""Taiwan independence"" force, and the government aims for a peaceful and steady cross-Straits relationship and to protect the common interests of people on both sides of the Straits. ""It (the live-fire drill) is a warning to the United States, to Tsai Ing-wen and Lai Chingte,"" said Wang Hailiang, a researcher of Taiwan studies at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences. Tsai is the island's ""president"" and Lai is the ""premier"". ""The message is clear. The statement made by the Taiwan affairs office is very sharp and it has sent a strong and clear signal. ... Further military activities can be carried out around Taiwan if the tension escalates,"" he said. A series of military and political events between the US and the island－such as whether US Marine Corps units protect the new site of the American Institute in Taiwan－will take place in May and June, Wang said. ""If the US and Taiwan have recognized the signal from the mainland's military drill, they should keep a low profile to avoid incurring Beijing's anger,"" he said. Spokesman Ma Xiaoguang said on Wednesday, ""China has always objected if countries with a diplomatic relationship with China establish any form of official or military connection with Taiwan,"" commenting on remarks that US Marines may guard the AIT."
1,"People from southeastern China are the most satisfied with their lives, while urban dwellers with high salaries have the lowest happiness levels, a recent report has found.  The report, published by a team from Tsinghua University, ranks the happiness of people living in China's major cities using a happiness index, calculated by analyzing posts on social media, including Weibo, last year.  Positive words in the posts add to the index, while negative ones reduce it, according to Beijing News.  All the first-tier cities — Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen — fail to make the top 100. Beijing is in 273rd place, near the bottom, while Luzhou, an inland city in Sichuan province, tops the list.  Richer people are not necessarily happier, the report concludes. In regions with a per capita GDP lower than 45,000 yuan ($6,900), people are happier as the economy develops. Once per capita GDP passes 45,000 yuan, people become less satisfied with their lives, it said."
0,"Xia An'an, a young man from Central China's Hubei province who was born deaf, got admitted into Beijing Union University this year. But his story is much more than that. Some 13 years ago, Xia left his hometown for Wuhan, capital city of Hubei, for a better education. Together with him were his grandparents, who have since been taking care of him. In a special education school, hearing impaired students including Xia have to work even harder. Being unable to listen to explanations from teachers means putting more effort into blackboard notes, especially in physics and mathematics. Xia and his 11 classmates have all been admitted to top domestic universities like Beijing Union University. This university is one of the country's top 12 for disabled students. The exams were conducted one by one inside these universities from late March to early April. But the exams for Xia and his classmates were not easy. A collection of train tickets, which they used to travel to different cities for the exam, appears thicker than a dictionary."

In addition, inheritors of the intangible cultural heritage Yangliuqing woodblock printing, folk clay figurine-making art Figurine Zhang, and leading kite-making brand Kite Wei will demonstrate their arts and techniques. Some investment projects in the horticulture, agriculture and leisure travel sectors will be on show to entice investors, Duan said."
0,"BEIJING - A class tutor at Beijing's Yimei Primary School, Zhao Lin has visited all 36 students' homes at weekends and summer holidays since 2014 to discuss their study with parents. Zhao offers practical advice on how to improve motivation and self-management. The aim is to get parents more involved in educating their children, says school principal Jin Hui. Although social networks and other new media have helped communication between teachers and parents, Jin believes traditional home visits are still necessary. ""Parents tend be bewildered about their children's education. Home visits mean teachers give one-on-one guidance in a targeted way. That helps create concerted efforts for educating children,"" Jin says. In September, the Chinese government issued a guideline on education reform, which called for improvements to ""family education and strengthening family education guidance services to help parents establish a rational educational philosophy"". China has an ancient tradition of family-led education. Some family rules and traditions pass down from generation to generation. However, this cultural legacy is now being tested. Some working parents have precious little spare time to spend with their children; some don't know how to talk with their kids effectively, especially if their youngsters are strong-willed or rebellious. Indulging children in online games has to some extent revealed weaknesses in family education. As a result, the demand of parents for scientific methods to raise children is growing. Books on child-rearing and education philosophy often appear on best-seller lists. Some parents consult professionals. Chinese authorities have pledged greater support and guidance. According to the Five-Year Outline on the Promotion of Family Education (2016-2020) released in November 2016, ""parent schools"" will be established in 90 percent of kindergartens, primary and middle schools in cities, and in 80 percent of rural schools by 2020. Public institutions such as museums and cultural centers will be required to hold at least two family education guidance sessions and two practical activities each year. More cities are integrating family education guidance into the public service system and increasing financial support. Beijing Municipal Commission of Education recently launched a program providing guidance to more than 500,000 families of kindergarten, primary and secondary school students. Launched in 2012, the ""mobile education lecture hall"" has held hundreds of free public lectures for more than 10,000 parents, inviting leading experts, scholars and teachers to answer questions. In Shandong province, family education research centers and mentor training bases have been set up with the help of universities, research institutions or internet platforms. Some places are fast-tracking local legislation on family education. Since the implementation of the Chongqing Family Education Promotion Ordinance in September 2016, public security agencies have admonished 1,323 parents or guardians for inappropriate family education. Family education is also regarded as crucial for cultivating and promoting socialist core values among China's youth. Qi Zhenjun, principal of the Primary School Affiliated to Beijing Chaoyang Teachers College, believes the essence of traditional Chinese family culture, such as filial piety, should be creatively applied to modern family education. In his school, parents volunteer to be guest speakers at flag-raising ceremonies, sharing their life and work experience with students. The school also encourages students and their families to do volunteer service in the community. ""Parents' mindsets and the home environment are thought to influence child development greatly. Parents can set a good example for their children and help instill social responsibility through these activities,"" Qi says. Some Chinese parents only focus on intellectual education, sending their kids to extracurricular classes to raise test scores."

Speaking to Xinhua, Tewolde Gebremariam, CEO of ET Group, said China's large geographical size has meant its not always convenient for Chinese wanting to come to African countries to process their visa applications in Beijing. Gebremariam said ET has the largest air network for an African airlines in China, currently travelling to five Chinese destinations, helping Chinese and foreign nations living in various corners of China to directly travel to Ethiopia and beyond without the need to transit in Beijing. Ethiopian Airlines currently has daily passenger flights from Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa to Guangzhou and Beijing and three times a week passenger flights to Chengdu as well as daily passenger and cargo flights to Hong Kong and Shanghai. ET is also planning to start passenger flights to Shenzhen and cargo flights to Zhengzhou in the coming few months. ""The plan is to have a visa hub in Addis Ababa, where Chinese visitors can directly travel from our five Chinese destinations to Addis Ababa and be able to apply for visas of 35 African countries through their embassies in Ethiopia,"" said Gebremariam. He further said 35 African governments have reached agreement with Ethiopian government on the visa scheme, which intends to boost Chinese investment prospects in Africa. ""Most African countries' embassies are located in Beijing, but China is a big country and some Chinese may not be able to come to Beijing to apply for visas in countries like Zimbabwe, Zambia or Nigeria,"" said Gebremariam. ""The visa scheme will facilitate easier air travel for Chinese experts and business people and reduces their financial cost. We believe the visa scheme will significantly boost China-Africa trade ties and we are very excited about it,"" he further said."
0,"Beijing -- A study by Chinese scientists in East Antarctica has shown that penguins existed in the region 14,600 years ago, 6,000 years earlier than previously thought. The study was conducted by a research team from a laboratory co-founded by the State Oceanic Administration and the University of Science and Technology of China. The research in the Vestfold Hills in East Antarctica found deglacial sediment dating back 15,600 years, and sediment of penguin excrement and dirt dating back 14,600 years. This shows that penguins immigrated there around 1,000 years after the ice sheet melted, and the population kept growing. The results are important for research into the evolution of seabird breeding grounds in polar regions, the positioning of penguin shelters during the last deglaciation and penguin migration in Antarctica."

The two men, Li Tao and Shao Haipeng, have suffered from paralysis for months. They planned to walk 42.195 kilometers at key spots along the journey, including the ancient city of Kashgar, the Terracotta Warriors in Xi’an and the Temple of Heaven in Beijing. Li, 40, was diagnosed with myelitis and became paralyzed from the waist down in 2016. Shao, 28, injured his spinal cord from a falling accident in 2017 and could not stand or walk since then. The two men started their marathon on Saturday morning at Kashgar and will finish the journey at the destination of the Nanjing Olympic Sports Center. They will apply for a Guinness World Record with a notary public witnessing the whole process. “Some people have called us ‘iron men’ when they saw us in wearable robotic equipment,” said Shao. “People here in Xinjiang are very passionate and friendly. Strangers we met often cheered us up.” “In Kashgar’s ancient city, some children picked wild flowers on the roadside and showed us the way. They are like angels. They made me extremely happy.” Li said that though it is difficult for him to walk a small step, he has the confidence to complete the marathon and realize his dream. “We walk the marathon to encourage more disabled people like us,” said Li. “We hope that they can pull together and return to society.” The two walked 6 kilometers at the ancient city of Kashgar on Saturday, before they flew to Xi’an for the next stop. Their wearable robotic equipment -- designed by a rehabilitation robotics company in Beijing, Beihang University and Jiangsu Province Hospital -- is China’s first exoskeleton robotic equipment certified by the China Food and Drug Administration."

The delegation, led by the Vice-Minister of Commerce Wang Bingnan, held discussions with Finnish businesses and handed out official invitations to 100 representatives for the event in November. ""New Era, Shared Future"" is not just the CIIE theme, but an invitation from China to share the huge consumption potential of the country's 1.4 billion population, Wang said at the roadshow held at the Chinese Embassy to Finland. Speaking at the inaugural session of the CIIE in November 2018, President Xi Jinping said that China is likely to import more than $30 trillion worth of goods and $10 trillion worth of services in the next 15 years as the nation's citizens continue to upgrade their lives. China has been Finland's biggest trade partner in Asia for 15 years and CIIE is a great opportunity for businessmen from both countries to deepen partnerships and expand economic cooperation, Wang said. ""This year marks China-Finland Year of Winter Sports and we hope Finnish businesses, including those in the winter sports industry, will come and join the second CIIE for demonstration of their products and services,"" Wang said. During the first CIIE, a concept biofuel vehicle called Biofore from Finland stole the limelight as it became the expo's first exhibit to reach Shanghai. It was presented in the Finnish national pavilion, which was designed to demonstrate the country's strength in various industries such as forest industry, clean technology, shipping and clean energy. A business delegation comprising representatives of 91 Finnish enterprises also joined the first expo for cooperation opportunities with Chinese partners, according to Jusa Susia, head of region for East Asia at Business Finland. Eight Finnish enterprises bagged more than 20 contracts worth hundreds of millions of US dollars during the six-day event, Susia said. This year, Finland will continue to use the CIIE as a platform to explore more partnerships not only in industries such as information technology and clean energy, but also in winter sports and early childhood education, he said. As China prepares to host the 2022 Winter Olympics, the nation, which has not been traditionally known as a strong winter sports nation, has joined hand with Finland to launch the China-Finland Year of Winter Sports 2019 to strengthen cooperation between the two countries. ""I believe this special year of cooperation can offer many highly interesting opportunities for Finnish and local companies as well their public sectors, leading up to the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics and beyond,"" said Anne-Mari Virolainen, Finland's minister for foreign trade and development, when she led a business delegation to the opening week of the China Finland Year of Winter Sports 2019 in Beijing in January. Valle Kulmala, CEO of Air0, a Helsinki-based company specializing in air purifiers, was also present at the roadshow sharing the company's experience in the inaugural CIIE. He said Air0 has benefited more than expected from last year's participation. The company has got to know a great number of end users and cooperation partners, which has allowed Air0 to get a better understanding of the market trend, said Kulmala. While Air0 has signed up for the second CIIE, five more enterprises including Beneq, Venla-Tuote Oy and Havina By North Oy also registered for the event during the roadshow. Elozo Oy, a Finnish company that has signed up for the second expo, has even registered for the annual event next year. More than 1,800 companies have signed up for the second CIIE, the Ministry of Commerce has said. Over 900 companies from 77 countries and regions have confirmed participation as exhibitors, including 180 Fortune Global 500 firms and leading enterprises in various industries, Gao Feng, a spokesperson for the ministry, said at a news conference on April 4. As the world's first import-themed national-level expo, the first CIIE was held in Shanghai from Nov 5 to Nov 10 and concluded with deals worth about $57.8 billion."

The train, which carries a maximum of 1,283 passengers, travels on the Beijing and Shanghai high-speed rail line at a top speed of 350 kilometers per hour. It has 22 business class seats, 148 first-class seats and 1,113 second-class seats. The first of these longer Fuxing trains left Beijing on Saturday at noon and arrived in Shanghai Hongqiao Railway Station at 4:36 pm. The Fuxing, or Rejuvenation, is China's self-developed bullet train. Before the launch of the 17 carriage-train, the longest Fuxing had 16 carriages. Fuxing trains took to the rails in June 2017, first with eight carriages, and in July 2018 with 16 carriages. The 17-carriage version is 439.9 meters long. Miao Zheng, the driver of the first 17-carriage Fuxing, said the train added an extra carriage between the 15th and 16th carriage, expanding the total length of the train from 414 meters to about 440 meters, according to Beijing News. China began using a new national railway schedule on Saturday that adds 16 services on the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed rail line. As the high-speed rail network expands, the bullet train has become one of the Chinese people's favorite means of travel. Some 20.6 million trips were made on Dec 30 and 31, the first two days of the New Year holiday, a year-on-year increase of 549,000, according to CRC. The company estimated some 413.3 million trips will be made between Jan 21 and March 1, the 40-day Spring Festival travel rush, a year-on-year increase of 8.3 percent. Some 10.33 million trips are expected to be made each day, setting a new record. Spring Festival is China's most important holiday and also the most challenging time for transportation departments. Tickets can be bought 30 days in advance via the internet and by phone. On Sunday, tickets went on sale for Chinese Lunar New Year's Eve, Feb 4.

The company plans to put 3,200 km of new high-speed rail track into operation this year, putting it one year ahead of its schedule for having a 30,000-km high-speed rail network."
1,"YANGON -- Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC), Beijing has chosen the right path of development which has brought prosperity to its people, Chairman of the Myanmar-China Friendship Association U Sein Win Aung told Xinhua in a recent interview.  After decades of reform, China has established a market-oriented economy based on its own national conditions, said U Sein Win Aung who is also former Myanmar ambassador to China.  Since it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, China has become the world's second largest economy and economists expect that Beijing may surpass Washington to rank first in the near future, he said.  China adopted a market-oriented economy and established special economic zones along its coastal areas, which has successfully attracted foreign investment to boost the economy in the country's east, he said.  Meanwhile, Beijing unvelied a strategy in 2000 to open up the country's west, and has achieved remarkable economic development that continues today, he added.  He also praised China's multi-party cooperation and consultation under the leadership of the CPC as a good political system because party representatives can make proposals at the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.  Commenting on the Belt and Road Initiative, U Sein Win Aung said the initiative, which benefits China as well as the rest of the world, is a project of peace connecting Asia, Europe and Africa.  The Belt and Road Initiative, proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013, comprises the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, which aims to build trade and infrastructure networks connecting Asia with Europe and Africa on and beyond the ancient Silk Road routes.  The initiative will bring about common prosperity, upgrade infrastructure, facilitate flow of commodities and enhance mutual understanding through cultural exchanges, U Sein Win Aung said.  Myanmar dominates an important position geographically on the Belt and Road, he said, expecting the country to play a larger role within the initiative's framework.  China has been working to maintain peace and stability globally, he said, adding the world will be more stable if common prosperity is achieved.  He expressed hope that the CPC will further develop and lead China to continue contributing to global development."

China believes in making the economic pie bigger and sharing it better through openness and cooperation, instead of pursuing a ""zero sum"" game, Han Wenxiu, an official of the Central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission, said at the ongoing 20th China Development Forum. China will pursue sustained progress in the Belt and Road Initiative under the commitment to achieving shared benefits through extensive consultation and joint contribution, and have more partners join and benefit from its development, Han said. It will also create more opportunities and platforms for trilateral and multi-party cooperation for more win-win outcomes, he said. The country will continue to shorten the negative-list to open up more sectors and ensure national treatment for foreign investors, and will step up legal protection of intellectual property rights and punishment for infringements, he said. The country will accelerate making relevant rules for the foreign investment law, level the playing field for foreign and domestic enterprises, and take on the issues of balance and structure in foreign trade, Han said. Higher-level opening-up will promote China's economic structural reform and high-quality development, he said, adding that the country will turn external pressure into internal strength. The three-day China Development Forum, which kicked off Saturday, will focus on key issues such as the supply-side structural reform, new measures of proactive fiscal policy, and the opening-up of the financial sector and financial stability. More than 50 officials from the Chinese central government's departments and over 150 overseas delegates will participate in the forum, including 96 executives from the world's leading companies and nearly 30 globally well-known scholars."
1,"From unmanned capsule gyms to unmanned convenient stores, various kinds of high-tech unmanned facilities are popping up across China. In Xuzhou, East China's Jiangsu province, a 24-hour self-service convenience store named BingoBox has attracted many customers.  People can use their WeChat, a popular social media platform, to scan a QR code on the door to get access to the store and then do shopping.  After picking up goods they would like to buy, they just need to put them on the goods recognition area near the cashier.  The goods recognition machine can recognize the goods and display the names and quantity of goods and a payment QR code on the screen, which customers can scan to make the payment. If someone tries to take goods out of the store without paying for them, the door will close and the sound system will remind the customer.,In Shanghai, many unmanned capsule gyms, called Park Box, have sprung up in some living quarters since this March. Having three sizes of 8 square meters, 18 sq m and 28 sq m, the capsule gym equipped with treadmills, dumbbells and intelligent training systems is open 24 hours. People can book the gym on their mobile phones and pay 10 yuan ($1.6) per hour.,In Beijing, an unmanned cafe has been put into operation at the campus of the University of International Business and Economics since September.  The cafe, covering 12 sq m, has two self-service coffee vending machines and a bar counter.  Customers can order dozens of drinks including fresh coffee, milk tea and hot chocolate on the machine and check through mobile payment tools."
0,"Authorities say fake trademarks threaten public health, city's image  Food and liquor brands are favored targets of criminals looking to profit by forging well-known trademarks, a report by Beijing's top prosecuting authorities said on Thursday.  In 2016, prosecutors in the capital accused 51 people of forging trademarks. Of those, nearly 85 percent involved counterfeiting popular Chinese food and liquor trademarks - including Beijing duck and baijiu, the national drink of China - according to the report released by the Beijing People's Procuratorate.  ""We found some defendants had no food hygiene licenses, let alone a clean and regulated process to produce food and liquor,"" said Wang Wei, deputy chief prosecutor of the authority. ""They bought raw materials at a very low price, processed them roughly and then sold them in the name of registered trademarks in market.""  For example, a resident surnamed Bai was found putting partially cooked duck meat purchased from wholesale markets into packages with the well-known Quanjude trademark in a small workshop in Changxindian township of Beijing's Fengtai district from April to September last year. Quanjude is a Beijing-based restaurant chain known for its roast duck.  Bai brought in 680,000 yuan ($98,800) by selling the fake meat. When he was arrested on Sept 23, police officers found 696 packages of fake Quanjude duck in his workshop, along with delivery invoices and many packages displaying the trademark.  All the goods were verified as counterfeit.  On March 28, Bai was sentenced by the district court to two years and six months in prison for infringing on a registered trademark, and was fined 150,000 yuan.  ""Such crimes not only damage the interests of trademark owners but also harm residents' health. That's why we fight them without hesitation,"" Wang said.  Jiang Shuzhen, director of the prosecuting authority's economic crime supervision department, said forging Beijing's traditional and well-known trademarks also damages the city's image and hurts tourism.  While increasing supervision has been directed toward the safety of food and medicine as required in recent years by the Supreme People's Procuratorate, she said cooperation needs to improve with other government departments.  ""A platform on which the city's administrations, including commercial and industrial departments, can share information is being considered. I believe it will help us a lot to seek clues and effectively fight counterfeit-related crimes,"" she said.  In 2016, the city's prosecutors approved the detention of 80 people and prosecuted 137 people suspected of harming intellectual property rights across the city. Of those, most related to trademark infringement - including foreign brands, mainly from the United States, Europe, Japan and South Korea, the report said."
0,"China is testing a Fuxing bullet train whose length and carrying capacity are double those of the current models, according to CRRC Tangshan Co, the developer. The 415-meter-long train has 16 carriages, twice as many as trains already in operation, the company said in a news release. The units are undergoing final tests at the China Academy of Railway Sciences in Beijing, which focus on 28 major functions, including tractability, braking, network communications and aerodynamic performance. The new train, which will have a designed speed of up to 350 kilometers per hour, will receive permits for manufacturing on a large scale if it passes all tests, according to the company, which is part of the State-owned China Railway Rolling Stock Corp. The Fuxing - or Rejuvenation - is China's domestically developed new generation of bullet train. In September, the speed of the Fuxing model was increased to 350 km/h on the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway line, making it the fastest operating train service in the world. According to its developer, the longer model is designed for long-distance and high-speed travel. More than 80 percent of the 254 major industrial standards under which it falls are Chinese, and are higher standards than in their Japanese and European counterparts. The new model has made great progress in areas including reliability and energy conservation, and it reduces life-cycle costs below previous models, the company said. Yang Hao, a professor at Beijing Jiaotong University who studies traffic and transportation, said the extended length of the Fuxing bullet train requires a more sensitive operating system, which in turn doubles its carrying capacity to more than 1,000 passengers. ""The longer model can also make better use of platforms in stations for high-speed trains,"" he said, noting that platforms are usually 650 meters long. The Fuxing trains were put through their paces during this year's Spring Festival travel rush, which ended on Monday. The Ministry of Transport announced on Monday that about 2.97 billion trips were made nationwide during the 40-day rush, roughly the same as last year. During that time, 79 pairs of Fuxing trains saw service, covering up to 23 provincial capitals, according to a report by China Central Television."
0,"As soaring property prices force many to consider leaving Beijing for cheaper cities, a pilot project offering subsidized housing in the capital to nonlocal residents has made some to think again.  Unsurprisingly, competition to land a subsidized apartment is fierce.  On Tuesday, more than 1,000 people braved a chilling spring wind to stand in line for at least four hours to apply for one of the 400 so-called public rental homes.  A total of 120 homes are reserved for people who do not hold Beijing hukou, or household registration, a major change from the policy of previous years.  The registration line in Maquanying - a suburb of Chaoyang district where 300 of the apartments are located (the rest are in Daxing district) - stretched more than 300 meters on Tuesday afternoon.  ""The line was this long at 9 am, and it's still this long at 2 pm, even though we're handling 120 applications an hour,"" said a community worker who declined to give his name.  He said the huge number of applicants was beyond expectations and that 30 extra workers had been added to the 20-strong team that worked on Monday, the first day for applications. The last day is Wednesday.  To qualify for a subsidized apartment, applicants without Beijing hukou must have paid social insurance or income tax in the capital for at least five years, be 18 to 45 years old and own no property. Applicants will then be selected at random.  On Monday, almost 60 percent of the applicants were non-Beijingers, the worker said.  On Tuesday, as the line moved slowly, many complained about the trouble created by on-site application and sighed over their slim chances.  Gao Yang, 30, from Henan province, has been working in Beijing for six years as an IT engineer in Chaoyang district.  ""It's a long line and the chances are slim. But if I'm not in line, there is no hope of renting an apartment at half the market price,"" Gao said.  The price of the public rental housing available this time is about 2,400 yuan ($348) a month for a two-bedroom apartment. A similar property on the regular rental market can cost more than 5,000 yuan a month.  Gao Chao, who works as a designer in Fengtai district, said he has to live with his wife and two other couples in a three-bedroom apartment to save money, but the rent is about the same as at the public rental housing.  ""It's like trying your luck buying a lottery ticket. But as long as there is hope, I want to try it,"" the 30-year-old said.  The offering of the 400 public rental units is the first wave of a pilot project that aims to help people without Beijing household registration. In the pilot, 30 percent of public rental housing and price-fixed housing will be allocated to people without Beijing hukou.  So far, 10,300 tenants, or 13 percent, of these live in public rental housing in Beijing do not hold such registrations.  According to a survey by China Youth Daily published on Tuesday, 23 percent of 2,000 respondents had already left top-tier cities like Beijing, while 47 percent were considering leaving. The main reason given was soaring housing prices."
1,"JD.com Inc, China's second-largest e-commerce player, has been helping villagers in poverty-stricken areas since 2016 with multiple measures, said Liu Qiangdong, CEO of the company.  As part of the measures, JD gives newly hatched chicks to villagers in some poor areas.  ""Equipped with a monitoring device, each chick should have walked 1 million steps before they can be sold on JD.com,"" said Liu, adding that chicken raised in such a way can be priced more than six times higher than those raised in cages.  He made the remarks in a speech at a forum themed ""Sharing internet dividends for poverty alleviation"", as part of the 4th World Internet Conference.  Entrepreneurs and officials participating in the forum agreed that internet technologies and e-commerce can make an increasing contribution to the poverty alleviation campaign.  Li Jun, 32, Party secretary of Xiuyun, a village in Sichuan province, said the village has opened some popular restaurants in provincial capital Chengdu, with food produced by the villagers on their own land.  ""For example, the chicken served at our restaurants is priced according to their age rather than its weight,"" said Li, adding that the practice is aimed at avoiding the use of unhealthy foodstuffs for faster growth.  Customers who are content with the food will very often register on their own e-commerce platform by scanning QR codes in the restaurants, he said.  Beijing Spruce World Technology, which owns meicai.cn, an e-commerce platform for organic food, has been contributing to poverty alleviation by contracting with the villagers for the latter's products, according to Liu Chuanjun, chief executive officer of the company.  ""Orders from e-commerce platforms help the villagers avoid market risks,"" said Liu.  Tang Ke, head of the market and economic information department at the Ministry of Agriculture, said featured industries in the agriculture sector accounted for 68 percent of the turnover by the end of 2016, up from 52 percent in 2012.  China's economic development is unbalanced and connectivity to the internet is essential to solving the problem. The Ministry of Agriculture is working on a project in 10 provinces to establish at least one internet service station in each village, said Tang.  Connectivity means not only infrastructure, but also the knowledge of using the internet, since many of the poverty-stricken villagers don't know how to use it, said Li Jun of Xiuyun village.  Since 2012, more than 7 million people who were previously employed in cities have returned to their rural hometowns to start their own businesses.  With more young and better educated people returning, the popularity of the internet in rural areas would greatly help poverty alleviation, Tang said."
1,"China is catching up fast with advanced economies in adopting and fostering the internet of things or IoT to make manufacturing more efficient and competitive, said the head of China operations of a global consulting firm. Dan Starta, managing director and partner of A.T. Kearney Greater China, said the government's strong support for the corporate sector will make China one of the most connected countries in the world. While North America currently leads in IoT adoption, Asia-Pacific countries and China in particular are rapidly catching up. According to the China Annual IoT Development Report (2016-17) published by the China Economic Information Service, China's IoT market has grown by 20 percent annually over the past few years, reaching 900 billion yuan ($136.3 billion) in 2016. It is expected to reach 1.5 trillion yuan by 2020. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology anticipates more than 1.7 billion public machine-to-machine connections will be enabled by 2020. By then, China is expected to account for 59 percent of the connected device market in the Asia-Pacific region, excluding Japan. Starta said manufacturing spend on the IoT will account for a major portion of the overall IoT spend. Key investment areas include asset tracking, connected field devices and condition-based maintenance, and autonomous robots. Market research firm IDC predicted that Chinese manufacturing IoT spending will grow by 15 percent annually to reach $127.5 billion by 2020. ""The rapid growth in adoption of the IoT will largely be fueled by Chinese government policies. While it is the manufacturing powerhouse of the world, China is challenged by slowing economic growth, increasing labor costs, and higher consumer expectations,"" said Starta. ""The Chinese government recognizes the key role of the IoT in manufacturing industries' efforts to modernize and remain competitive, and has therefore incorporated the IoT in its 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-20). Adoption of the IoT is key to the government's 'Made in China 2025' and 'Internet Plus' strategies,"" he said. The IoT 13th Five-Year Plan, published by the MIIT, provides clear guidelines and goals for development through 2020. These include developing and strengthening capabilities around telecom, cloud computing, the IoT, and big data, and reducing reliance on foreign technology and imports. Rather than waiting for government policy to stimulate the market, domestic companies China Aerospace Science and Industry Corp, Sany Heavy Industry Co and Haier Group have all pushed their own industrial cloud platforms to grab as much market share as possible. ""Financial support such as special funds are available for key development projects, and numerous pilot programs are also underway across the country, including the IoT industrial development clusters in the Bohai Sea Rim, the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta regions,"" said Sun Fuquan, a researcher at the Beijing-based Chinese Academy of Science and Technology for Development. He said the country also needs to ensure that the current investment in technologies, including the internet, robotics and virtual reality, will be leveraged to the benefit of its industries."
1,"The building of Qinghuayuan tunnel has begun Monday in Beijing as the Beijing-Zhangjiakou intercity high-speed railway construction enters its key phase, reported China News ServiceTuesday. The tunnel is located in Haidian district, extending underground from the Beijing North Railway Station for 6,020 meters before going aboveground to the north. Chen Shuang,chief engineer of Beijing-Zhangjiakou railway project, said the Qinghuayuan tunnel will go through three subway lines, seven crucial city roads and 88 municipal pipelines. ""The tunnel is a shield tunnel with high risk as it is located in the city core and passes through some of the most complex underground layers and most important buildings,"" said Chen.  ""Shield tunneling can minimize the destruction of current fundamental construction features such as roads, pipelines, pedestrian overpasses and bus stations, and also reduce noise pollution and the interference to people and residential communities,"" according to him. The Beijing-Zhangjiakou high-speed railway has a total length of 174 kilometers with 10 stops, which is the first ballast track with maximum speed of 350 km/h, able to pass through Alpine regions and sandstorm areas, according to the Beijing Railway Administration. The project is scheduled for completion by the end of 2019 and will shorten the trip between the two cities from the current three hours to just one hour. It is a vital transportation construction for the 2022 Winter Olympic Games co-hosted by Beijing and Zhangjiakou."
0,"Since its debut in 2016, SuperCello has helped many Chinese youngsters to meet and interact with professors and young musicians from schools overseas. Everywhere Beijing-based cellist Chu Yibing goes he carries along with him a traditional balm famous for its sharp odor and power to relieve fatigue. During the past year, he has been fully occupied with SuperCello, a four-day event he initiated in 2016. It will bring together more than 60 cellists from around the world to Beijing from April 28 to May 1. ""The smell keeps me calm and relaxed. I sent hundreds of emails and made phone calls to discuss details with the musicians. It took lots of sleepless nights to make everything happen,"" says Chu, 53, a great cellist of his generation. Born in Beijing to musicians Zhu Yongning and Wang Yaoling, both teachers at the capital's Central Conservatory of Music, he started learning the cello at age 8 and went to Europe to pursue his music studies in 1983. Six years later, he became the principal cellist of Switzerland's Basel Symphony Orchestra. After nearly two decades living and working in the West, he returned to China in 2004. He can speak Italian, French and German. SuperCello, held once a year during the May Day holiday, offers full-day events to audiences such as recitals, master classes and workshops. It turns the hallowed arena of the concert hall of National Library of China in Beijing, where classical musicians perform serious music, into ""an amusement park"". ""From breakfast to dinner, you are surrounded by music, which is a rare experience for most Chinese audiences,"" says Chu. ""It is all about music and communication. Everyone has a great time here."" Unlike classical music recitals, which have different ticket prices, Chu decided that ""there is no first class, second class or third class. Audiences just come and sit, or stand anywhere they want"". ""You can leave and return at any time as long as you show your ticket,"" he says. This year, the event will start with exchange programs between Chinese and Western students during the afternoon of April 28. At 7:30 pm on the same day, the Romanian Youth Orchestra will perform under the baton of conductor Philippe de Chalendar with pieces including Antonin Dvorak's Concerto for Cello and Orchestra in B Minor, Edouard Lalo's Concerto for Cello and Orchestra in D Minor and Dmitri Shostakovich's Concerto No 1 for Cello and Orchestra.,Other guest musicians include German cellist Julius Berger, a professor at the University of Augsburg; French cellist Marc Coppey, a professor from the Paris Conservatory, and Swiss cellist Wen-Sinn Yang, a professor at the Academy of Music and Theater in Munich. Speaking about the event, cellist Martti Rousi, professor at the Sibelius Academy in Helsinki, Finland, who attended the SuperCello event in 2017, says: ""SuperCello is a cello festival with the feeling of a rock show. There is lots of support, knowledge and dedication from the audience. You must be there to understand it. I feel privileged to be coming back. ""I also feel the performers and audience together bring out the beauty, emotion and drama of the fantastic music. Without the audience we cannot do much."" The cellist will give a master class on April 29 and perform Ernest Bloch's Schelomo: Rhapsodie Hebraique for Violoncello and Orchestra on April 30. The event will be wrapped up with a free concert on May 1 by the China Youth Philharmonic Orchestra and five cellists from France and Germany, including Jerome Pernoo, Raphael Pidoux and Marc Coppey, under the baton of conductor Shao En, with repertoires such as Franz Schubert's Arpeggione Sonata in A Minor and Camille Saint-Saens' Concerto for Cello and Orchestra No 1 in A Minor. Chu says that many children who are learning cello attended the music festival last year with their parents, and the event is a great opportunity for them to meet professors from established music schools and interact with young cellists. From 2004 to 2017, Chu worked as the head cello teacher at the Central Conservatory of Music. And among his successful students is Yang Yichen, a young Chinese cellist, whose band, Amber Quartet, won an international chamber music competition in 2013, making it one of the first Chinese quartets to do so. Chu formed his cello ensemble in 2005, dedicating most of his time to chamber music. And he has toured the country with the ensemble, performing in places where the cello is rarely heard. In 2015, he and his team visited locations along the ancient Silk Road and performed works by Bach, Debussy and Mahler. The venues included Qinghai Lake in Northwest China's Qinghai province. Separately, Chu and his team also played amid natural settings in nearby Gansu province, at venues such as the Yadan National Geological Park, which has landforms created by winds from the Gobi Desert. In 2016, when SuperCello made its debut, Chu celebrated his 50th birthday with the audience and his musician friends. He says ""it was a fabulous birthday"". ""Every year, the audience and musicians surprise me. The excitement is indescribable,"" he says about the project."
0,"Newly built Fuxing bullet trains going 160 kilometers per hour have no excessive formaldehyde problem and will be scheduled to be put in service in batches, according to a statement from China Railway Beijing Group Co Ltd. The Beijing company released a statement on its official account on Sina Weibo, China's Twitter-like service, Monday evening to refute a mistaken report from China Business Journal from earlier that day. According to the report, some sources close to the Beijing company said at least two branches of China Railway Corp, China's railroad operator, have received newly built Fuxing trains of 160 kilometers per hour with excessive formaldehyde problems and stopped running them. The Beijing company said in the statement there was no such situation, and the reason that have not been used so far is due to long-term debugging and waiting for the ""new car smell"" release period to pass. It said the trains will be arranged to be put into operation in batches. Railway authorities pay high attention to passengers' health and environmental issues, trains deemed unfit for operation will not run, and they will request manufacturers to renovate and ensure quality, the report said."
1,"BEIJING - While bracing for the first China International Import Expo (CIIE), worldwide participants including officials and company leaders are actively edging the competitiveness of their exhibits or products. Among them, hopeful words like ""opportunities"", ""chance"",""promising"" and ""great platform"" are most frequently mentioned when referring to the mega expo, which will be held in Shanghai on Nov 5-10. From the big beneficiaries of China's opening-up policy like European auto-industry giants to fresh comers such as African food and beverage suppliers, there is a common aspiration to make best of the expo to promote their brands and products, and take bigger shares in the lucrative market of China. ""We look forward to meeting companies we can collaborate with as we are always seeking to expand our ecosystem of partners,"" said German software corporation SAP in a statement. It told Xinhua that the CIIE provides a new platform for global businesses to collaborate and promotes common prosperity of the world economy and trade. Metro, a leading German international company in wholesale and food retail, said that it wants to take the opportunity of the CIIE to showcase its strength in imports and global sourcing. Philippe Palazzi, chief operating officer and management board member of Metro AG, said: ""We also want to use such a great platform to enhance our exchange and communication with local customers, business partners and other stakeholders as we are committed to the long-term development in China."" For Danish brand Danisa, which sees itself as a ""beneficiary of China's opening-up to the world policy,"" the expo means more customers and partners. ""We believe that through this event we will have better exposure in China and find more partners to help us distribute our products to not only tier-1/tier-2 cities, but also further into tier-3/tier-4/tier-5 cities,"" said Erik Bresling, CEO of Danisa. Companies which are believers of China's development and beneficiaries of the opening-up policy make a big part of CIIE participants. Regional delegations also attach great importance to the platform, viewing it as a gateway and window to know better China's market and development path. So far, over 150,000 buyers from home and abroad are estimated to attend the expo. Apart from business exhibitions, 80 countries and three international organizations have confirmed their participation in the country-pavilion exhibition, which covers a total area of 30,000 square meters. Horacio Licon, vice president of the Greater Houston Partnership, an economic development organization serving the Greater Houston area, told Xinhua that the expo is a great opportunity for Houston to continue developing its trade relationship with China, the second largest trading partner of the region. Licon will lead a team of 15 delegates representing 12 companies to Shanghai in November, which cover diverse industries such as technology, manufacturing, energy and logistics. ""We have expectations in terms of understanding and hearing directly from our Chinese counterparts on the private sector and on the government side, the messages about the future of Chinese trade, how the government is seeing the future of Chinese trade and how Houston will play a role in that relationship,"" Licon said. The American delegate's concern is understandable as the US-initiated tariff frictions with major trade partners are threatening the hard-won international trade rules and prickling China-US economic ties. According to John Edwards, British consul-general in Shanghai, the CIIE is a great opportunity for newcomers to understand the Chinese market as well as the customers while on the other hand, it is also ""a very special symbol of China's opening-up."" His comments echoed President Xi Jinping's remarks on the expo. ""Looking ahead, China will open still wider and its development will deliver even greater benefits to the rest of the world,"" Xi said in a speech at the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in Vietnam last year, adding that the CIIE ""will help all parties to better share the opportunities of China's development."" ""The expo sends a strong message from China in favor of free trade and multilateralism,"" Argentine political observer Patricio Giusto, who is head of consulting firm Diagnostico Politico (Political Diagnosis), told Xinhua in a recent interview. According to official data, more than 2,800 enterprises from more than 130 countries and regions have confirmed their participation in the first CIIE. Some companies such as Metro and accounting firm EY have even registered for the 2019 expo as they believe that free trade and opening-up that China always advocates is win-win for everyone."
0,"The Beijing Municipal Committee of Transport said on its official Weibo account that two separate rules on technical requirements for shared bikes as well as their parking have been rolled out following the publication of a general guideline issued last week. Each new shared bike should be tested and proved qualified before being rolled out of factory. Shared bikes that have been put into use should be rechecked annually and unqualified bikes should be recalled, according to the new rules. Shared bikes need to be installed with GPS with an accuracy error of less than 15 meters and a smart lock, while information on a bike's location, in-use time and locking status needs to be streamed to the company's database. Each bike should have a clear, permanent steel seal, including a unique code number. All new shared bikes need to pass a quality test and will have a three-year lifecycle. Companies that provide shared bikes need to facilitate parking by providing a digital map to users depicting where parking is allowed or forbidden. They also need to maintain real-time monitoring on bike use and report the data to government platforms for supervision. With Beijing's 15 bike-sharing companies together operating 2.35 million bikes across the city, new additions have been banned."
1,"Colin Maki, an American violin dealer, is trying to develop a market for old rare violins in China. Four rare violins were brought from New York to Beijing in August. And before a music event at the Yale Beijing Center, attendees were able to have a close look at the instruments and take pictures. They were placed on a small table, without any special protection. Maki, founder of an independent instrument consulting firm in New York, brought the violins to the event. He spoke to the audience while keeping a close eye on the violins. ""I have to be very careful about their safety. Each of them has been covered by insurance. Very high insurance,"" he says. ""So, I do not often display them in public like this."" Li Yuhe, a violin teacher at the Conservatory of China, played the first sheet of Violin Concerto in E Minor by Felix Mendelssohn on each of the instruments. ""Each of them has a rather different tone, and they are all magnificent,"" she says. ""But the Strad is my favorite."" ""Actually, I am here for the Strad,"" she says. The Stradivarius, or Strad, she played is one among only around 500 Strad violins left in the world, each of which is worth millions of dollars. A mere mention of the Stradivari is enough to create a buzz among musicians.  The Stradivari family is one of the most prominent violin makers in history. No one knows the secrets of how the Strads were made.  Violins made by the Stradivari family during the 17th to 18th centuries, which is now considered the golden age of violin-making, cannot be reproduced. Lighter than modern violins, and exquisitely crafted, a Strad violin is almost every violinist's dream. But few are able to afford one. For the past 20 years, Strad violins have increased in value at an average annual rate of around 14 percent, according to data from Rare Violins of New York. ""The value of Strad violins has never gone down,"" says Maki.  ""You can just hold it for years and see its price soar."" He adds that a famous trader once said that maybe 100 years ago most fiddles were in the United Kingdom, but 20 to 30 years ago there were probably more Strad violins within the 30-mile radius of Chicago than in the entire United Kingdom. But now they are moving China. In 2015, the 1727 ""General Dupont"" Stradivarius violin was sold to a Chinese collector, a first. And Maki says that having visited China several times, he feels it is the time to step into the market. Data from Art Basel and UBS Global Art Market Report released earlier this year shows that China has the largest share of the market in global sales of art and antiques at open auctions. Zhang Maolun, an amateur violinist and a collector, says: ""Everyone knows that China is an untapped market. We have more wealthy people now."" ""But it is hard to reap profits here as the market here currently is barren."" This is because unlike Chinese paintings or chinaware, violins remain new and unfamiliar territory. Preservation and fixing violins — old violins need to go to violin doctors on a regular basis — can be quite a headache for Chinese investors. ""So the business prospects remain bleak,"" says Zhang. The day Maki arrived in Shenzhen, his first stop in China, he was contacted by a wealthy collector in Beijing. That gave Maki some confidence. ""We need to develop the culture first and do a lot of education — from its investment value to how to keep the violins in good condition."" With nearly 15 years of experience of selling instruments in different parts of the world, he says it worth a try. ""I know it takes time,"" he says. ""I don't sell a Strad every day."""
0,"Beijing will implement mandatory trash sorting rules in public spaces such as schools, hospitals and business areas, in a move to further encourage citizens to participate in garbage classification, a senior city official said on Wednesday. Resident credit accounts, including how people sort their domestic trash in their daily lives, are also set to be established so that some violations will be recorded in occupants' accounts, Zhang Jiaming, deputy mayor of Beijing, said in a report submitted to the Standing Committee of the Beijing Municipal People's Congress on Wednesday. ""We will set up a mechanism that garbage trucks can refuse to transfer trash if it is not classified."" Real-time supervision of all kinds of garbage in the city will begin soon to drive the classification, he said. Beijing has carried out trash sorting since early 1998 when Dachengxiang community in Xicheng district became the first neighborhood to classify garbage. At the end of 2011, the city published China's first domestic waste management regulation, which took effect on March 1, 2012. However, the implementation of trash sorting in Beijing hasn't gone well in the past decade, since mere encouragement is not enough for citizens to change their habits, said Hao Zhilan, director of the urban construction and environmental protection committee at the Beijing's People Congress. The previous regulations didn't give specific fines for households, companies or institutions that fail to sort their garbage properly. ""Mandatory trash sorting is thus necessary for people, and revising the rules is also urgent in order to specify that garbage classification is a duty for waste producers,"" she said. A survey conducted by the standing committee of the municipal people's congress in April showed that only 20 percent of those sampled can accurately discard kitchen waste in trash bins. The survey was based on 3,071 people in 16 downtown and suburban districts of Beijing who lived in the areas for more than half a year. The survey showed that residents' unwillingness to participate in garbage classification is due to a lack of trash sorting facilities in communities and the irregular garbage transfer by trucks. Hao also suggested establishing a report-reward mechanism on mixed garbage transport activities and including trash sorting on an individual's credit record. Disciplinary measures should be administered to violators. She added that some specific measures should be taken to reduce the waste produced by the express delivery industry and to recycle packaging. In 2017, the Beijing municipal government released a waste disposal action plan specifying the four categories for sorting household trash: dry garbage, kitchen waste, recyclables and hazardous waste. It also aimed to have trash sorting reach 90 percent of the city by 2022. Some projects based on the resources from garbage recycling in Beijing's suburbs will be completed by the end of this year, along with the establishment of trash sorting demonstration areas in the capital."
0,"As the opening film for the 24th Beijing College Student Film Festival (BCSFF), the love-comedy   unveiled its mask to the audience in advance at Beijing Theater on April 8. The film cast, including director Xu Hongyu, executive producer Peter Chan, actor Takeshi Kaneshiro, actress Zhou Dongyu and Xi Mengyao, were all invited at the opening ceremony of BCSFF and met with college students and movie-goers. The film mainly tells the story of a romantic encounter between an overbearing CEO and a special girl due to food. In the film, Zhou Dongyu acts as talented chef master Gu Shengnan who can integrate recipes with human feelings while the CEO Lu Jin, played by Takeshi Kaneshiro, is a successful businessman but is very particular about people and food. The ups and downs between the two people delight the movie storyline. Meanwhile, the tasty food element adds glamour to the entire movie. Usually, a movie premiere takes place several days before hitting the big screen. But   was premiered 20 days in advance. ""This is really risky, but we have confidence about the box office,"" director Xu said, ""The movie is in line with the theme of the film festival and it is my honor to see it mark as the opening film for the whole festival."" ""It is a touching movie and we have done a lot for it. For instance, I paid a visit to a cooking school for five days and tried to learn practical cooking skills, which makes me behave more like a chef in the film,"" Zhousaid. The movie will be officially released on April 28, and represents another work by the Peter Chan film team after the award-winning   last year."
1,"BEIJING - American cherry vendor Marc Pflugrath worries the trade friction between the United States and China will hurt his business. ""I have a lot of concerns about the current actions that have been taken on trade and tariffs. The fact that China is an important customer makes us very vulnerable. I think this is significant, real and serious for rural America,"" he said. Pflugrath is one of the millions of American business owners likely to bear the brunt of a potential trade war started by their own government. The United States is one of the largest exporters of fruit through Tmall, the Chinese online retail platform operated by Alibaba Group. According to Tmall figures, of the 168 billion yuan (about $26.6 billion) in transactions during the November 11 Singles' Day sales last year, 40 percent were from global dealers and retailers, many of which are headquartered in the United States. A manager who gave his name as Su, from Taiwan Kingo Fruit Trade Group, said Chinese consumers buy about 10 percent of the United States' cherries every year. The CIF (Cost, Insurance and Freight) cost of US cherries is about 6 yuan per kilo and that of Chilean cherries is 7 yuan per kilo. But if the tariffs are raised on US cherries, they will completely lose their price advantage and concede the Chinese market to competitors, he said. ""This will be a direct blow to cherry farmers in the United States. We have a stable supply from Chile, and the impact for us is quite limited,"" he said. US President Donald Trump announced last Thursday he had instructed the US Trade Representative to consider additional tariffs on $100 billion of Chinese imports, after announcing plans to impose a 25-percent duty on Chinese imports worth 50 billion dollars. China said it will ""fight till the end at any cost"" and take ""comprehensive countermeasures."" Hong Kong businessman Stone Lu blasted the US administration's logic on the tariff hike, saying it is unreasonable. Lu has plastic bag factories in Hong Kong and Changzhou in Jiangsu province. His company buys technical solutions from US companies Dow Chemical Company and Dupont. ""If the downstream orders for plastic bags are reduced, my factories will be forced to cut production and manpower, but upstream American companies will also bear losses. Their prosperity depends on orders from companies like us,"" he said. A tariff hike will cause a drop in orders, and the risks will be borne by each and every company along the globalized industry chain, he said. In the long term, big, small and medium companies in the United States will become entangled. ""Should a depression be caused, it will be difficult for American manufacturers to endure,"" Lu said. ""Tariff hikes would prevent Chinese goods from entering the American market, and the American people will have to pay higher prices for the same consumer goods. In a sense, their earnings will be hollowed out. If a trade war breaks out, the United States will hemorrhage jobs,"" said Yu Miaojie, deputy director of National School of Development at Peking University. ""China-US trade is already deeply intertwined. Free trade and adapting to globalization is the right thing to do,"" he said."
1,"At this station, a computer, a bookshelf and a dormitory are available to give the couriers a good rest. ""These services may seem simple, but by the standards of the express delivery industry, they are quite a luxury,"" said Li Yuezhen, of the Trade Union of National Defense and Post and Telecommunications, one of 10 major industry trade unions in China. On average, a courier works eight to 10 hours a day, said Hao Jie, head of SF's Deshengmen Gate station. The job requires high intensity, and most of the company's couriers are young migrant workers. The station is part of a pilot program initiated by the trade union that aims to better serve and unify workers in privately owned courier companies, Li said. Four such stations equipped with convenient facilities have been set up in the SF network in Beijing since the pilot program was launched in April last year. Data published by the trade union suggests that after the program was launched more workers have become members of the company's branch of the union. In the four pilot stations, 83 percent of the couriers have joined, compared with an average 67.7 percent for all employees of the company. In addition to the pilot stations, in each of the SF outlets in Beijing there is at least one representative of the company's trade union responsible for serving employees. Wang Qiang, a courier, said the union not only helps couriers cool off on hot days but also gives aid to employees with financial difficulties and other life problems."

1,"BEIJING - Yu Jing, an office worker in Beijing, takes an expensive approach to fitness. She gave up a 1,000-square-meter gym with an annual fee of 2,000 yuan ($291), and paid 9,000 yuan for 36 one-hour courses in a fitness studio located in a three-bedroom apartment outside the city's Third Ring Road. ""It is not a bargain, but I think the exercise will be more effective under the guidance of a private coach,"" said the 35-year-old. The Aosheng Fitness Training Base, with an area of only 150 square meters, opened in March and has about 60 members, according to Jin Long, a 27-year-old retired wrestler and founder of the studio. The studio has seven coaches, all retired wrestlers from North China's Inner Mongolia autonomous region. The studio is already profitable, as each member pays about 10,000 yuan for their courses, said Jin, who is busy searching for an apartment for a second studio. Jin came to Beijing five years ago, working as a fitness coach. ""Traditional fitness clubs concentrate more on sales and focus less on customer experience and services,"" Jin said. ""Our studio focuses on customers and bodybuilding results, which is the future direction of the industry."" As China's middle-class population is on the rise, small but more expensive studios like Jin's are sprouting up across the country. When Tang Lin, founder of i Fitness Space, set up his first studio in Beijing five years ago, there were roughly 20 such studios in Beijing. Now there are more than 1,500 in the city listed on online city-guide Dianping. ""Chinese people are not only paying more attention to their health but also are more willing to pay for better experiences,"" said Tang, adding that those born in the 1970s and 1980s are his main client base. Chinese people will spend about 1 trillion yuan on sports this year, said Ouyang Li, an official with the National Development and Reform Commission, at a news conference in August. ""The expansion of the high-end consumption population and upgrade of people's consumption demand is contributing to the rapid development of private fitness studios in China,"" said Yi Jiandong, a sports economy expert with Peking University's National School of Development. The coach training business is also becoming more lucrative. The number of trainees of Saipu Fitness Institute, the only publicly listed and leading fitness training organization in China, is expected to reach 40,000 this year, according to Zhao Siyu, assistant president of Saipu Investment Co Ltd. Saipu reaped 259 million yuan in sales revenue in the first half of this year, up 78 percent year-on-year. Its net profit increased by 81 percent to 72.38 million yuan during the same period, according to its half-yearly report, which attributed the growth to the rising number of trainees. ""Saipu has been expanding the scale of its five schools in Beijing and Shenzhen, and a new school in Shanghai is opening soon,"" said Zhao, adding that the company is also engaged in sports education and community fitness. ""The sports industry has entered an era of rapid growth as the per capita GDP of China has now exceeded $8,500 and people's demand for sports has risen,"" said Jiang Xiaojuan, a researcher with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. Capital is also pouring into the sports sector. In July, online fitness company Keep Inc raised $127 million in its D-round financing. The Chinese government is also aiming high for the sports sector to boost the economy. A recent guideline released by the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council, China's cabinet, called for creating new business models for sports consumption with great demand potential. As the fitness industry flourishes, Yi Jiandong hopes there will be an improvement in its professionalism and sports-science level. A shortage of talent is also a big headache, according to Tang Lin. Sports teachers, coaches and researchers that China's sports institutions are nurturing still lag behind, he said. Tang suggested Chinese universities create fitness coaching majors that cover subjects including sports and fitness psychology."
0,"Booths offering matchmaking services are propping up across several parks in Beijing, as parents of the unmarried continue to search nationwide for an ideal partner for their children. At the Temple of Heaven in Beijing's Dongcheng district, one can spot hundreds of greying men and women huddled behind two long rows of paper leaflets wrapped in plastic cases, listing the basic qualifications of their children. Hundreds more are seen moving along, skimming and scanning the leaflets. They pause every few steps to take notes of in-law prospects and toss out questions to confirm age, weight and height, occupation and places of household registration. This spot for seeking spouses, formed by parents spontaneously at least 10 years ago, has morphed into a well-organized market held four times a week. It also attracts attention as a must-see tourist spot, said a park official who did not want his name to be disclosed. ""When I was on patrol over the holidays, some people would ask me directly — where is the so-called matchmaking market?"" the official said. ""To me, it looks more like a farmers market with rowdy vendors,"" he added. Last year, Sichuan province and Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region saw unabated passion for matchmaking at public parks during the annual seven-day holiday, according to media reports. ""Rain or shine, the matchmaking market here is open on weekends, and more frequent sessions are held during the National Day holiday,"" said a regular surnamed Huang at the market in Nanning in South China's Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region. Huang said to a local news portal in Guangxi that on the first day of the holiday last year, more than 500 people visited the market, double the usual number of visitors.,A sudden camera flash put Zhang Wen on alert. Zhang, the father of a 33-year-old bachelor, visited the matchmaking market at the Temple of Heaven with his wife as part of their morning exercises. He resented being pictured at the market for fear of disgracing his son. ""He didn't complain about me going to the market, but I know he doesn't like this method and he never nods to the dates I have selected for him from the park,"" he said. Zhang said matchmaking markets in public parks, including the Temple of Heaven, Beijing Zhongshan Park, and Beijing Chaoyang Park, are always filled with the elderly. A rare appearance of a juvenile face will immediately draw inquisitive eyes. ""I know the basic requests of my son. He likes slender, tall women who are three to five years younger than him,"" Zhang said. ""I also talk with other parents to see if we can get along,"" he said. ""If they are not congenial, there are slim chances of our kids pairing up."" Zhang has introduced a handful of prospects to his son through the market by exchanging phone numbers with their parents. Together, they put their offspring in touch. But eventually, his son rejected them as they were ""not his type"". ""I find the younger generation strange in that they don't settle with a person who misses their criteria by one inch. They want perfection; while in my days, we are happy with a basic match,"" he said. Data released by the Ministry of Civil Affairs in August show that the marriage rate dropped for four consecutive years from 9.6 percent in 2014 to 7.7 percent in 2017, and the rate of separated couples has been climbing since 2010, reaching 3.2 percent last year. For the unmarried, nearly 50 percent of them are ""in no rush"" to get married and less than one third are free from working overtime, a report jointly issued in August last year by professional networking website LinkedIn and online matchmaking platform Zhenai said. ""I understand that the chances of finding a daughter-in-law in a market like this is extremely low, but it doesn't hurt to try my luck and try his luck,"" Zhang said.,Ma Lili, 25, an assistant accountant for a foreign company in Beijing, disagrees on vetting prospective spouses at matchmaking markets in parks. Ma said the market conveys a feeling of desperation from ""the leftover"" — a term used to classify those who remain unmarried into their late 20s and beyond. ""Parents endeavor to find an ideal spouse for us, but we have many more choices to meet our future husband or wife instead of a method that feels like putting ourselves up for sale,"" she said. She added that matchmaking markets in parks represent the traditional parent-dominated marriage arrangements that are losing grip on young people's mindset. Instead, a variety of online services have sprung up to turn explicit matchmaking into networking events that aim at expanding social circles and encouraging interaction. Research shows that 23 percent of unmarried working professionals prefer business networking to find life partners, 20 percent of them rely on matchmaking websites, and another 26 percent turn to matchmaking events and alumni gatherings, according to the report issued by LinkedIn and Zhenai last year. ""On weekdays after I log off from work, or weekends and holidays, I am willing to meet prospects introduced by my friends, colleagues or online matchmakers,"" Ma said. ""It feels more relaxed, more of a casual gathering, rather than an intentional matchmaking attempt,"" she said. The mounting pressure during holidays also prompted Jiang Shihui, a 28-year-old white-collar worker in Shaoxing, Zhejiang province, to seek help from an online matchmaker. ""My parents pulled a stern face around 11 pm in the living room and began a serious discussion on my marital status. I was petrified,"" Jiang sent this message via the instant-messaging app WeChat to Chen Yuting, a local matchmaker, on Oct 3 last year. Jiang said at that point, he also felt lonely as his friends were away with their girlfriends, leaving him alone at home. ""I reached out to Chen because she is around my age, she knows a lot of local girls and I feel more at ease describing my dream girl to her,"" he said. Jiang joined in parties organized by Chen. These events, though titled ""matchmaking gatherings"", are primarily about harmless chitchats and ice-breaking games that helped lower his guard. ""I don't see myself as a strong competitor in the realm of matchmaking. I feel nervous in most occasions but not at a gathering held by Chen,"" he said. Jiang made a couple of new friends and met a woman. He was engaged recently.,Chen Yuting has gained popularity among youngsters in Shaoxing, a city with a population of 5 million in East China, for her gift for pairing up couples. She has been connecting more than 8,000 single men and women via WeChat. ""I have been telling my customers repeatedly that you will be quite frustrated if fixated on finding marriage materials through my services,"" she said. Chen, born into the post-90 generation, said the unmarried are burdened with repetitive requests from older generations. ""When it comes to holidays, such as the Spring Festival and the National Day, I see a surge in customer inquiries because parents nag more during these times."" But the matchmaking market is a futile attempt, in her opinion. ""The single are not commodities. I don't peddle them, haggle over prices, or auction them off. Matchmaking is not only assigning a match for you, but also to expand your networks,"" she said. Chen prides herself on encouraging communication between young people. ""Some people rule a prospect out by attaching labels. One bachelor working in the IT sector told me his English teacher always scolded him in high school, so it's impossible for him to date an English teacher,"" she said. ""Well, he actually fell in love with a middle school English teacher at an event this May."" ""I nudged him to approach her because I saw a good match in every other aspect. His fear for the English teacher was not that important,"" she said. Li Tonggui, a professor of the psychology department at Peking University, said that matchmaking markets across Beijing cater to the older generations' requirements that primarily stress salary levels. ""Young people emphasize romantic feelings at the beginning of a relationship. They tend to enjoy the process of falling in love before considering tangible requirements like salaries and housing,"" he said. He added that a sense of security and warm feelings are key to developing an intimate relationship. ""I suggest parents encourage their children to engage in outdoor activates, such as jogging, trekking or going on a picnic,"" Li said. ""Young people should grab every opportunity to meet and connect with others in person to increase their chances of finding an ideal husband or wife."""

The United States remains their top destination with Los Angeles, Las Vegas and San Francisco being particularly popular. The US is followed by New Zealand, Germany, Thailand, and the United Kingdom, in terms of popularity, according to a recent report Tuniu Corp, an online travel agency based in Nanjing. Besides, the United Arab of Emirates, Belgium and France are growing in popularity as Chinese driving licenses are valid there. The top five cities where self-driving outbound Chinese tourists come from are Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Beijing. These cities have more than two million car owners, making them more likely to travel in their own vehicles in China and in rented cars abroad. Currently, there are more than 360 million car drivers in China, according to the Ministry of Public Security. ""The growth of holidays marked by car drives is frequently associated with wealth, freedom, and choice, and a growing middle-class in China,"" said Alex Yan, COO of Tuniu Corp. ""Meanwhile, we found that Chinese road trippers prefer to stay at nicer hotels, but not motels near the roads. More than 80 percent of the them usually stay at four-star or five-star hotels."" The majority of tourists who prefer self-driving trips are aged between 21 and 40, with those aged between 31 and 40 dominating this group. Most of them are affluent and tend to pursue unique trip experiences. Besides, many of them have young children and road trips fulfil their demand for travel with kids. Lily Min, 26, an office worker in Beijing, said she and her boyfriend last year traveled to Hawaii, where they rented a red convertible. ""Hawaii is large and it's inconvenient to travel around if you don't rent a car or travel with a group. It feels really cool to drive by ourselves, as we have greater control over our time. And it's not expensive to rent a car－it costs less than $100 per day,"" she said. Overseas road trips tend to take longer than an average trip. About half of these trips last year lasted 11 to15 days. Domestic road trips are also proving to be popular. Among the well-received weekend getaways are Zhuhai and Guangzhou in Guangdong province, and Changzhou in Jiangsu province. Longer domestic road trips to Tibet, Gansu, Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang are also popular among Chinese tourists. About half of the domestic road trips last six to 10 days."

Among the events, the Hungarian arts and crafts activities have captured the attention of many. Hungary's vibrant folk art culture can be traced back to the village life of centuries past. These traditions were passed down to new generations through artists and craftsmen who have devoted themselves to honing and teaching folk art. And now, they are sharing these traditions with some new friends. By using some dried corn husks, straws and a pair of scissors, Tunde, a travelling Hungarian folk artisan, showed the visitors how she turned trash into treasure. ""The people who live in villages, they grow corn and use all parts of the plant,"" she said. ""For example, the children would make toys from the leaves, ladies would make baskets ...something they could use in the kitchen or just around the house.""Depending on the shape and design of the piece, it can be hung, taped, or placed anywhere to boost the holiday spirit. In addition to making corn husk dolls, the visitors also had a chance to decorate their own traditional Hungarian gingerbread cookies, or mezeskalacs.  This decorative snack is popular during Christmas time, and the process of decorating the cookies is something that brings friends and family together - much like dumplings during Spring Festival.  ""I want my children to experience different cultures and learn about their tradition,"" one visitor said. ""Events such as this one give us just that - an opportunity for people to interact and learn about our respective cultures and customs."",Nagy Ildiko, cultural officer at the Beijing Hungarian Cultural Institute said the goal of the event is not only to share the Hungarian cultural heritage with visitors, but also to provide an opportunity for families to get together.

Kang came to Beijing in 2001 and worked in marketing department for various kinds of companies such as State-owned companies, foreign companies, joint ventures and internet entrepreneurial companies. At the end of 2016, she decided to resign from a well-known internet company as a senior manager and pursued her dream of opening a noodle shop. ""To start a business of my own has always been my dream. I was 36 then and for me it was a turning point in my life.

After heading to Tokyo to learn from the most popular noodle shop in January 2017, Kang opened her first Japanese restaurant in Sanlitun in Beijing in July last year. By using online marketing strategies and application of online data algorithms into marketing, Kang made the restaurant popular in four to five months. The thick soup makes the noodle taste special and it takes 16 hours to make the soup to guarantee good taste. As it costs high and takes time to make this thick soup, Kang only sells 80 bowls of noodles each day. Kang said one has to have craftsmanship spirit and ability to do things efficiently with limited resources to make the noodle delicious.

An estimated 50 million of those were railway trips, which would represent a 10 percent increase from the same period last year, China Railway Corp said.  Stations in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Shenzhen, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Chengdu and Zhengzhou were among the most crowded this year, based on ticket sales, the company said, adding that the travel peak appeared on Saturday, when 13.7 million trips were made.  The administration said 134 million trips were made during the three-day holiday, an increase of 14 percent from last year. Tourism income during the holiday exceeded 79 billion yuan ($11.5 billion), up 16 percent from last year.  It said road trips - particularly short-distance ones to suburbs and the countryside for events and activities such as admiring flowers and picking fresh fruit and vegetables - were tourist favorites during the holiday.  Statistics from lvmama.com, a tourism company, showed that the number of tourists booking short-distance trips on its platform during the break doubled those of last year, with tourists spending an average 1,200 yuan.  Most of the orders came from residents of cities such as Shanghai, Beijing, Hangzhou, Guangzhou and Shenzhen.

0,"Since 2015, oil painter Wang Lei has traveled along the Silk Road - an ancient network of trade routes that extended across Europe and Asia - to paint portraits of people from various cultures, a journey that the artist sees as a search for his own identity. Over the past three years, monks, women in hijab, young men of Persepolis, the descendants of soldiers of the Roman legion, craftsmen, vendors and tourists have all been depicted by Wang during his trips to cities in China, Iran, Uzbekistan and Turkey. The artist, who has just returned home to Beijing from his latest trip to Turkey, held a solo exhibition on Saturday at Beijing's Yishu 8, featuring faces painted along the Silk Road. ""My model can be anyone I encounter,"" explains the 41-year-old. ""It's more than a portrait. It's a record of a person in the context of a certain culture."" It's the enrichment of culture, religion and art of the many cities in different nations along the Silk Road - and the frequent cultural exchanges - that inspired Wang's plan to travel and paint. He started in Datong in Shanxi province, a cradle of Buddhist art where more than 5,000 sculptures of the sage reside in the Yungang Grottoes and the memory of these Buddha statues has influenced Wang's portraits. No matter whether he depicts men or women, each subject is given prominent ears, painted on purpose by the artist, to resemble those of the Buddha sculptures. In the village of Liqian in Gansu province, Wang met a man whose appearance was identical to almost every other Chinese person with the exception of his striking green eyes. They reveal his identity to be that of a descendant of the Roman legionnaires that came to the region more than 2,000 years ago. ""We learn about the world, its history and its cultures mainly from books,"" Wang observes, ""but there is a lot that books don't tell us, and we must find that out in person."" This is why he is impelled forward on his journey of discovery and believes that traveling is an important way to learn more about the world.,Christine Cayol, founder of Yishu 8, describes Wang as a ""nomadic painter searching for his own culture,"" who uses travel as a way to rediscover his own roots. ""To paint the faces, and capture the atmosphere and an impression of certain moments along the Silk Road, as opposed to the Silk Road itself, are true realities,"" she explains. ""It's a kind of going back to the geographic, climatic and human origins of Chinese culture."" It is not a new, nor a Chinese, tradition. Western painters have a long tradition of traveling to experience the world in order to broaden their horizons and improve their perceptions of the world. Artists in the 19th century went to Africa and the Middle East to find fresh subjects for their work. In the 1970s, Italian artists such as Francesco Clemente also embarked on journeys of discovery to countries like Afghanistan and Pakistan in search of the exotic, and inspiration from elements different to their own culture, explains Huang Du, an art critic. Wang is one of the few Chinese artists to go and find inspiration from other Asian countries, ""like a kind of visual archaeology,"" he adds. ""For a long time, Chinese artists have focused on Western culture,"" Huang elaborates. ""However, Asian culture's enrichment, and its geographical proximity, means that they deserve more attention now, because of the Silk Road strategy."" Wang, the Beijing-based artist, says he became obsessed with his trips to Asian countries. He often stayed for months in one country and talked as much as he could to locals and almost everyone he encountered on his trips. What Wang seeks, it seems, is to live like a local. ""The more I travel, the more questions I have about my own origin,"" he says.,Wang was born in northern China's Heilongjiang province, but his father was from eastern China's Shandong province. He lives and works in Beijing. ""The frequent movements of humans make the pursuit of our origin and identity a common desire the whole world over."" Wang's passion for traveling while painting comes from his years at the Central Academy of Fine Arts, where students were required to travel to rural places to produce artworks. After graduation, Wang spent three months living with a local family in Tashi Kuergan Tajik autonomous region in Xinjiang Uyghur autonomous region, a place near the border with Pakistan and Afghanistan, and it was there that he developed a love for painting portraits. Wang also has two other series of works - the myth series and relics series - based on the subject of the Silk Road. He has painted around 100 pieces for his portrait and relics series in the last four years. He's not finished either. While he's completed the Asian part of his Silk Road project, he plans to set off again later this year, this time to Europe. He will travel to countries like Italy, Germany and Romania, all of which hosted trading posts to transport goods along the Silk Road in ancient times."
0,"The prominence of aesthetic education in Beijing greatly expanded when the city's municipal education commission started a program to include institutions of higher education and social organizations in middle and primary students' aesthetic education in 2014. As part of this effort Beijing's 21st Student Art Festival, or the 2018 Exhibition of Educational Achievements in Youth Drama, will be held in the China National Theater for Children from Nov 14 to 29. Nearly 100 students and teachers from 30 schools, including universities, middle and primary schools and kindergartens, will perform onstage at CNTC. The 33 dramas they will bring to the audience reflect teachers' and students' understanding of drama education. Their performance will also provide inspiration for drama educators. During the festival, CNTC will also hold various drama workshops and lectures. Through these activities, it is hoped China's drama education will continue to develop in an orderly way and enable more children to understand and enjoy drama."

According to the conference, 2019 will see increased global security risks. The newly released China's Overseas Security Risks Blue Book evaluates the global security risk ratings of 170 countries and regions. The United States' security risk level has gone up due to complications in US-China relations and a worsening internal political situation after the US' midterm election had impacts on Chinese companies' investment in the US. The blue book forecasts five major global security threats in 2019 — great power games, global political instability, rising political identity, corruption and wealth gaps. China's 10 overseas security issues indicate Chinese companies should enhance early warning and response. ""Despite obvious risks regarded as normal issues, such regional conflicts and recessive risks have been increasing,"" said Li Wei, a researcher at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, at a forum on global security risks. He mentioned Japan, France and Germany are becoming involved in the Five Eyes intelligence network of the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, which will likely strengthen monitoring of overseas Chinese companies. Precaution against such risks should increase. Li Yonghui, head of the School of International Relations and Diplomacy at Beijing Foreign Studies University, warned of the risks of this alliance when US-China relations began experiencing challenges. The vice dean of the School of International Studies at Peking University, Zhang Haibin, said correlation between traditional security risks and non-traditional risks is getting stronger, which brings up questions of major country responsibility."

0,"BEIJING - A number of online accounts have been shut down this week for posting vulgar content, according to the Beijing cyberspace administration. The administration on Wednesday urged major online platforms to enforce the shutdowns to contribute to a healthier online environment. The platforms with closed accounts include the Twitter-like social media service Weibo, and WeChat, an instant messaging app. Most of the banned accounts posted entertainment industry gossip, while some were owned by famous paparazzi. The administration accused them of vulgarity and invading the piracy of celebrities among other issues. The shutdowns were enabled by the country's new cyber security law that was passed in November 2016 at the bimonthly session of the National People's Congress Standing Committee after a third reading, and went into effect on June 1. The administration released another statement Thursday, calling on the public to report vulgar content on the Internet to provide a safer online environment for teenagers, with summer vacation approaching. According to the statement, as of Thursday, a total of 11,798 pieces of vulgar content have been removed by the center for illegal and harmful online content in Beijing in 2017. The shutdown has aroused mixed reactions from the Internet users, with some applauding the action. ""I cannot stand the constant invasion of celebrities' privacy, and some of the gossip is completely made up,"" said ""Weierxiaojie"" on Weibo. ""It's so good to know that it has finally been taken down."" Others were concerned about the potential concealment of misconduct in the entertainment industry. ""Now it is 'safer' for celebrities to misbehave,"" said Weibo user ""jilongfei"". Users also pointed out many more accounts posting vulgar content have not yet been shut down, asking for further action to clean up the online environment."

0,"BEIJING -- Grassroots governments in Beijing are now required to conduct weekly home visits to elderly residents who live in their own homes. The municipal civil affairs department said that those aged over 80 who live alone should be prioritized, as well as those caring for disabled dependents. Home visits should be provided for at least 50,000 senior citizens this year, it said. Beijing has 3.5 million residents aged over 60, and 9.8 percent of them are living alone. Li Hongbing, deputy director of the department, said that the home visits will help address to the needs of the elderly and provide information on their health conditions. The visits should be done by the subdistrict offices, township governments, or elderly care organizations entrusted by them, Li said. The city government has taken a series of additional measures to improve the at-home care of its senior citizens, including funding the installation of safety facilities, such as handrails, elevators big enough for wheelchairs and emergency call devices, as the city currently does not have sufficient nursing homes to meet the needs of its aging population."
0,"In the face of harsh accusations of poor taxi service, Beijing South Railway Station has upgraded its facilities to provide passengers a better experience when they wait for cabs at night, the station's spokesman said on Monday. Beijing South, one of Beijing's three major railway hubs and one of Asia's largest train stations, has faced questions in the media recently over poor passenger experiences, including long waiting lines for taxis, ""black cabs"" outside of the station that overcharge and difficulties entering and leaving the station. The station handles about 154,000 passengers each day on average during the summer travel rush. From July 1 to Aug 31, the station is expected to handle 9.53 million travelers. The station has installed 14 air-conditioners and glass fences in taxi-waiting zones, and is allowing more hailed cars and online booking for taxis after 9 pm to cater to demand. An LED screen has been installed to display real-time information about the taxi line, including estimated waiting time, Liang Zhaoyu, spokesman for the station, told China Daily on Monday. The station will install fans and renovate the roof in the taxi waiting zone to make passengers more comfortable, he said. The project will be finished by the end of August. Last week, news stories about taxi shortages at Beijing South went viral online. The city's subway shuts down at about 11 pm. But from 11 pm to midnight, about seven to 10 trains arrive at the station, leaving as many as 10,000 passengers searching for taxis and night-shift buses at the same time. At night, passengers have complained about waiting two or three hours for a taxi at the station. If a passenger isn't willing to wait, they could catch a ""black cab"" outside the station, which often asks three times the regular price. Nighttime buses are also limited. The news has renewed Beijing residents' longtime discontent with the station. The station's name, Beijing South, has been used derisively as ""Beijing difficulty"" by netizens and media, since the word ""south"" in Chinese is pronounced the same as the word ""difficulty"". To tackle the problem, stakeholders including government departments, the station and the railway company conducted an on-site survey and conferred on Sunday to find solutions. Starting on Sunday, passengers can order buses at night. The transport authority will release nighttime train arrival information through Beijing transport radio and the taxi dispatch center, encouraging more taxi drivers to pick up passengers during late hours. The authority will also encourage taxi companies to dispatch more taxis to the station. Departments of transport, public security and others will make joint efforts to clear nearby streets and keep the illegal ""black cabs"" off the streets."

0,"Sun Xiaoming, 35, had never left ground until being loaded into a medical helicopter on March 26. The air ambulance transported Sun, who had been in a coma for five days, to the China-Japan Friendship Hospital in Beijing, and the noise of the chopper was so loud that patients and their relatives came out to watch it land. If Sun had been transported to Beijing from his home in Raoyang county of Hengshui, Hebei province, via an ambulance instead of a helicopter, it would have taken at least three hours to cover the distance of more than 250 kilometers. However, with the medical helicopter, the trip took only around 40 minutes. Last winter, Sun started to have difficulty breathing but didn't think twice about it. However, his symptoms worsened and, in the week before flying to Beijing for treatment, he was treated at a local hospital. But Sun had a high fever and fell into a coma. ""I am usually busy at work and often stay up late. And I also like drinking and smoking,"" Sun said. ""Maybe the unhealthy eating and living habits made me fatter and fatter."",At China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Sun underwent two major operations, including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and heart valve replacement. He spent more than 80 days at the hospital and lost about 60 kilograms - down from 230. ""Since we had to perform his surgery while preventing him from severe infection and high fever, the time saved by the helicopter-based medical evacuation mattered a lot,"" said Liu Peng, the hospital's vice-president. With the upcoming 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, air rescue has emerged as part of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei coordinated development plan. Though the service in China is in early stages of development, it has had rapid development. On June 15, Sun recovered and was discharged from the hospital. He was the first patient in Hengshui to use the helicopter ambulance service. ""Thanks to everyone, including my wife and doctors. It's you who gave me a second chance,"" he said."
1,"The surge in passenger traffic and asset securitzation of the Beijing-Shanghai High-Speed Railway, one of the country's most profitable rail routes, will put more pressure on the airline industry, according to experts. Their comments came after China Railway Corp began promoting the asset-backed securitization and equity financing of the railway sector last year. In addition, Caixin Media, a Beijing group that provides financial and business news, reported last month that CRC and related partners are preparing for the Beijing-Shanghai High-Speed Railroad to go public. Securitization is the financial practice of pooling various types of contractual debt, such as mortgages, and selling their related cash flows to third party investors as securities. The 1,318-kilometer railroad has reported profit growth for four consecutive years since 2014. Supported by 36 pairs of bullet trains running in both directions each day, it transported 160 million passengers last year, double the originally targeted passenger flow volume in 2011. The railroad earned 29.6 billion yuan ($4.3 billion) in sales revenue last year, while airlines carried about 7.5 million passengers between Beijing and Shanghai airports, earning 7.4 billion yuan in such revenue, according to CRC and the Aviation Administration of China. Because the majority of passengers traveling by air between Beijing and Shanghai are business travelers, they are ""insensitive"" to fares, and airlines rarely offer tickets at a discount on this route, said Cheng Zhiwei, a researcher at the National Development and Reform Commission's Institute of Transportation Research. ""Therefore, many people choose high-speed trains between China's two biggest cities, as they offer relatively cheaper prices and rarely experience delays on journeys due to thunderstorms, rain or snow,"" Cheng said. Ticket prices for first-and second-class seats on the Beijing-Shanghai High-Speed Railway are 933 yuan and 553 yuan, respectively, and a one-way journey takes between 4 hours and 18 minutes and 6 hours and 20 minutes. An economy class air ticket costs 1,360 yuan on Air China and China Eastern Airlines, and the one-way air journey takes 2 hours and 15 minutes. Yang Xin, a researcher at China Academy of Railway Sciences Corp, said airlines have to pay a service fee to airports, and their operating costs are frequently affected by fluctuations in the international oil price. Rail passenger service providers are backed by national investment and the support of local governments and shareholders. The Beijing-Shanghai line was initially proposed in 1990, but construction only began in 2008. The work was completed in 2011 at a cost of 221 billion yuan. The trains can run up at speeds of up to 350 kilometers per hour. Other bullet train services such as those between Hangzhou, the capital of Zhejiang province, and Ningbo in Zhejiang, and between Shenzhen in Guangdong and Guangzhou, the provincial capital, have all reported handsome profit growth in recent years, data from the CRC show. Therefore, journeys of between 500 kilometers and 1,200 kilometers will pose a strong challenge to airlines compared with long-haul trips. Due to high-speed rail links, airlines have stopped operating short-haul routes between Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, Changsha, the capital of Hunan province, and Nanchang, the capital of Jiangxi province, Yang said. They have also stopped operating between Chongqing and Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan province, and Xi'an, the capital of Shaanxi province. Zhou Qinghe, chairman of CRRC Zhuzhou, a subsidiary of railway vehicle and equipment maker China Railway Rolling Stock Corp, said, ""Challenged by China's well-developed high-speed rail network, signaling network and onboard WiFi access, as well as more leg room and food delivery services at stations, it is time for airlines to bring new ideas into their business on short-haul services."""

1,"DHAKA - The upcoming China International Import Expo (CIIE) has been a big boon to revitalize the world economy, Bangladeshi experts said on Tuesday. Experts here believed the mega expo in Shanghai is the most significant event which China has so far arranged because it demonstrates China's renewed determination to open its door wider for trade and investment amid the rise of protectionism. They said the CIIE, to be held in Shanghai on Nov 5-10, will open up enormous commercial opportunities for participants from about 130 countries and regions, many of which have joined the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative. The Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road Initiative, proposed in 2013, aims to build a trade and infrastructure network connecting Asia with Europe and Africa along the ancient trade routes of the Silk Road. Munshi Faiz Ahmad, chairman of the Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies (BIISS), said this is a clear manifestation of Beijing's commitment to holding out its arms open wide to the world. ""This expo is a significant move from the end of top Chinese leadership to facilitate countries and regions all over the world to bolster economic and trade cooperation,"" said the BIISS chairman. He said this will surely help promote global trade and world economic growth in order to advance the development of an open world economy. Citing a report released by the Chinese government, Ahmad said China had lifted more than 700 million people out of poverty through 40 years of reform and opening-up. Against this backdrop, the expo in Shanghai is aimed at firmly supporting trade liberalization and economic globalization and actively opening the Chinese market to the world. Ahmad said he saw domestic consumption as the most important driver of the Chinese economy, as suggested by the supply-side reforms, adding that the Chinese economy has also ""shifted from quantity to quality with a sharp rise in the number of middle-income Chinese."" ""China acts timely to support the countries facing economic hurdles in the face of an increasing protectionist tendency,"" said the expert. Experts here said China is sincere in its efforts to build the expo into a world-class one so as to promote world economy and global trade as well as to achieve common prosperity. Khandaker Golam Moazzem, research director of Bangladesh's Center for Policy Dialogue (CPD), told Xinhua that traditional Chinese trade fairs emphasized on what Chinese firms could sell to the global markets. But for the first time, he said, a special event is organized to tout foreign companies selling to China. The researcher from Bangladesh's leading think tank said the CIIE, for the participants, is not merely an opportunity to have more market in China but also elsewhere in the world. He said the expo will be a platform for countries like Bangladesh to seek new untapped opportunities in commerce by establishing trade links with many countries and regions along the Belt and Road routes. Undoubtedly, he said, opportunities lie for all countries to revitalize their economies. If the expo meets its goal as set by China, Moazzem said, all the countries of the world, especially those which joined the Belt and Road Initiative, will yield maximum benefits for their people. ""So far we understand this (event) will emerge as an alternative to the current (trade) platforms of the world."""
0,"An international public security conference aimed at sharing experiences related to sports events and improving cooperation between police officers at home and abroad will open in Beijing on Thursday. The two-day conference will pursue topics related to safeguarding the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games. Representatives of law enforcement from countries that have hosted major sports events after 2001 - especially the Winter Olympics and the World Cup - including Canada, South Korea and France, will attend to share their experiences. ""We successfully held the Summer Olympic Games in 2008, but we have little experience with how to ensure security at a major sports event in winter,"" said Gao Hongjun, deputy director for foreign affairs at the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau's office. ""We are eager to learn from the experience of others to boost our security measures."" The conference provides four forums for attendees, Gao said, allowing them to communicate on anti-terrorism, services for foreigners, city security, gymnasium security and advanced security technologies. ""The conference will also be a good opportunity for many Chinese police officers to better understand ice and snow activities,"" he added. ""We hope to further contribute to improving our security-related cooperation with the other countries."" Although it will be the first time for the bureau to hold an international conference with such a theme, communication with police officers from other nations has been ongoing since 2014. In 2015, China and Italy signed a memorandum of understanding about setting up joint patrols in tourist spots in both nations - the first such agreement between China and a foreign country. Since then, China has sent more than 30 police officers to Italy to conduct joint patrols in three groups. Italy sent 16 police officers to China in two groups. In November 2016, the bureau co-hosted a law enforcement meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization with the foreign affairs department of the Beijing government and issued a cooperation declaration. Last year, groups from 15 countries and two international organizations in Southeast Asia were invited to take part in a law enforcement conference organized by the bureau. There were heated discussions on several judicial issues, including the fight against terrorists, drugs and cross-border crimes. They also established a long-term communication system to share police affairs. ""Thanks to such memorandums and law enforcement conferences, we've established trust with other countries, and that trust is the basis of judicial cooperation,"" Gao said. ""We'll maintain the trust to effectively solve crimes, supply better services for residents and guarantee the capital's security."""
1,"Royal DSM NV, the world's biggest maker of vitamins, said it expects more than 10 percent revenue growth in China in the second quarter of this year compared to the same period last year. The new prediction comes as it continues a major expansion phase amid the country's fast industrial and consumption upgrading boom, its chairman said on Thursday. DSM Chairman Feike Sijbesma did not put a figure to the Q2 sales, but its full year earnings report showed that the company's China business accounted for 12 percent of total sales revenue in 2016, reaching over 7.6 billion yuan ($1.12 billion). The company's sales revenue in China grew by 18 percent in the first quarter of this year. Sijbesma told China Daily in an interview, while attending the Summer Davos forum in Dalian, that his group will continue to seek investment opportunities in China this year. It launched a new Vitamin B factory in Shanghai last year, which produces for human nutrition and animal nutrition, and it also acquired a Suzhou-based high-performance solar photovoltaic backsheet manufacturer in February. Sijbesma said China's national development strategy now emphasized quality economic growth as well as green, low-carbon and sustainable development and DSM was looking to further expand its presence in the country's solar power, next-generation vehicle materials and energy efficiency projects. The company has 21 factories in China and employs over 4,700 workers. DSM's China regional headquarters and the China science and technology center are located in Shanghai. Sijbesma said rising incomes and the accelerating pace of urbanization in China are also driving demand for more diverse and convenient diets. Additionally, higher incomes have stimulated the consumption of meat proteins. He said DSM still sees upside in the daily caloric intake of consumers in China, especially proteins. To feed a population of more than 1.3 billion, more agricultural products are now produced and sold in China than anywhere else, and this has boosted overall food consumption in China during the past decade. ""During the process of agricultural modernization, China's transformation can be summarized as a combination of growth and demand that is linked to income and urbanization,"" Sijbesma said. ""Those two elements came together to create the sheer size of the market."" Sijbesma said the Belt and Road Initiative is a creative conception, committed to creating a common development of many countries and regions related to the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. DSM has already shipped its food, beverage and dietary supplement products from its plants in China to markets involved in the initiative, including economies in Europe, the Middle East and Southeast Asia, to further enrich its global sales network. Eager to further diversify its business, the Heerlen-headquartered group in recent years has also expanded its operations into the field of personal care, to produce skin care, sun care and shampoo. Ding Lixin, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences in Beijing, said that for new growth drivers for China to explore home and global markets, an obvious path to take was modernization of the livestock and the food supply chain, a big area with a lot of room for investments. ""The demand for juices, soft drinks, yogurt and milk will provide a number of opportunities for the food and ingredients business,"" Ding said. ""The sector has been showing excellent potential in both domestic and overseas markets."""

On Nov 5, students and teachers from the National Academy of Chinese Theater Arts will stage The Legend of the White Snake and four other traditional Peking Opera pieces.    Xu Chao, the deputy Party secretary from the National Academy of Chinese Theater Arts, says The Legend of the White Snake is a classic piece by Peking Opera master Cheng Yanqiu (1904-58) and it has been revived by the famous Peking Opera actress Zhang Huoding, who is teaching at the National Academy of Chinese Theater Arts.  ""Last year, we established a training center led by Zhang Huoding focusing on the Peking Opera techniques of master Cheng. The students under Zhang's guidance will perform The Legend of the White Snake in the upcoming festival,"" says Xu.  Another one of the five shows is Chao Jin Ding, a classic Peking Opera piece known for its martial arts scenes, adds Xu.

0,"Chinese sports technology company Keep will open more brick-and-mortar fitness rooms as part of its broader effort to cash in on consumers' growing enthusiasm for sports, its CEO Wang Ning said. The comments came after the three-year-old startup raised $1.27 billion from cash-rich investors including Goldman Sachs and Tencent Holdings Ltd. ""Offline fitness rooms, called Keepland, are where our online users can meet each other and get help from coaches to improve their exercises,"" Wang said. ""We will open about 10 such rooms in Beijing by the end of this year. In the future, we hope each city will have such a place."" Started as an app offering workout tutorials, Keep is working hard to branch into new services, in the hope of building an ecosystem that centers on quality sports content. ""User-generated fitness content is one of our biggest advantages,"" Wang said. So far, Keep has around 150 million registered users. Keep opened its first offline Keepland in Beijing to turn some of its online users into offline communities, which can help cultivate user loyalty and fuel their enthusiasm. ""We have also unveiled a smart treadmill that comes with a tailor-made operating system which can better track users' exercise data and help optimize their training programs,"" Wang said. Priced at 1,999 yuan ($290), the treadmill is designed as an item of hardware that can link consumers with other smart wearables at home. Its sales have exceeded 10,000 since its launch in March. The Beijing-based company is also preparing to launch a virtual coaching service, by leveraging artificial intelligence technology. By combining all the exercise data from online users, as well as smart health and fitness facilities, the company said it hopes virtual coaching services can help more consumers access personalized coaching services at a relatively low cost. Such ambitions were unveiled after the company finished its series D financing, led by Goldman Sachs. Other investors include internet heavyweight Tencent, GGV Capital and Morningside. Zhang Kaixun, managing director of Goldman Sachs, said: ""Amid the current wave of consumption upgrading, sport has a huge potential market. By better integrating online and offline services, Keep can influence the lifestyle of young people."" The company is also exploring overseas markets, with its international versions now supporting more than 10 languages including English, German, Japanese and Spanish. To better build its brand, Keep also held offline activities in Beijing earlier this month to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics and to encourage more young people to keep fit. During the past years, China has witnessed stunning growth in the sports industry linked to digital and online merchandise. A report released last year by iResearch showed the total Chinese active users of online sports and fitness products had exceeded 350 million. Chinese internet heavyweights such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, Tencent and Xiaomi Corp have also expanded their presence in the sector through acquisitions or partnerships. Backed by government policies, high-tech equipment and products are being rolled out to help people stay healthy. Custom-made fitness programs are also in vogue. ""With the rapid development of new technologies, including big data and the internet of things, smart sports will enable a more personalized and smarter exercising experience,"" said Chen Gang, director of the Jiangsu provincial sport bureau."
0,"Sixty-five students from 23 countries are visiting Beijing to experience Chinese culture on a tour of the country organized by the Bureau for External Cultural Relations of the Chinese Culture Ministry.

0,"The Silk Road International League of Theaters has been headquartered in Xicheng district, Beijing, deputy district director Xu Li announced March 27. The ambassadors of Colombia, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Sudan, France and the Philippines in China attended the ceremony. The Silk Road International League of Theaters was launched at the Tianqiao Performing Arts Center in Beijing in October 2016. Initiated by the China Arts and Entertainment Group, the largest State-owned company in China in the field of entertainment and arts exhibition, the league serves as a platform for performing arts that aims to promote cultural exchanges between China and other countries. 86 theaters from 32 countries and regions have joined the league.

1,"China will upgrade its financial opening-up tasks for this year by unifying regulatory rules for domestic and foreign players in the financial sector, and improve connections between onshore and offshore capital markets, according to Yi Gang, governor of the People's Bank of China, on Sunday. The standards required for foreign institutions, in terms of share proportion, company form, business scale, shareholder qualification and number of licenses, will be the same as those for Chinese companies, he said at the China Development Forum 2019 in Beijing. After checking a ""to-do"" list set a year earlier, Yi expressed satisfaction with what has been achieved so far. ""Most of the 11 tasks for financial opening have been done, leaving very little work to implement,"" he said. ""But the overall level of opening-up still has room to improve."" The further opening-up will tighten connections between domestic and overseas capital markets, with continual improvement of the qualified foreign institutional investors scheme, as well as the Shanghai-Hong Kong and Shenzhen-Hong Kong stock connect programs, Yi said. ""Both Chinese and foreign institutions can equally enter business fields that are not named in the negative list. But all players should have licenses before starting to do business, and their activities need to be under the same regulation,"" he said. Market watchers expect new measures to debut this year to attract more foreign financial institutions to China, owning more shares in joint ventures or even taking control of the company, as well as widening the domestic financial markets for overseas investors. ""Currently, when foreign investors enter Chinese market, they will find out that the hedging tools, financial derivatives and other financial products still need to further develop. The key task this year is to provide sufficient financial hedging instruments to let investors effectively manage risks,"" Yi said at the forum. Financial opening-up is an independent decision made by Chinese policymakers based on the country's self-development, Yi added. ""The current monetary policy framework can cope with further opening of the financial market."" He also pledged to improve transparency in accounting, taxes and regulatory rules. Former US Treasury secretary Jacob Lew said: ""Historical experience shows that market opening can achieve a win-win situation."" However, he added that China needs to learn the lesson from the United States' financial crisis and improve regulation to prevent risks imported from overseas markets. ""Deleveraging is central, but it is hard, so I suggest Chinese policymakers stick with it going forward,"" Lew said, stressing that risky areas may include financial product innovation, shadow banking and fintech. As of the end of last year, China's macro leveraging level - the total debt-to-GDP ratio, declined to 249.4 percent from 250.9 percent in 2017, according to data from the central bank. Yi, the governor, said that to raise funds through the equity market, rather than relying too much on issuing debt, is a method to stabilize the level of leverage. Starting next month, the yuan-denominated government and policy bank bonds will be added to the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Bond Index, phased over a 20-month period. After their full inclusion, yuan-denominated bonds will become the fourth-largest currency component, following the dollar, the euro and the Japanese yen. Global banks predicted that the index inclusion will inject about $700 to $800 billion of overseas funds in the next five years. Based on a recent survey conducted by Bloomberg, more than 67 percent of participants in Asian markets expect to invest in Chinese onshore bonds this year, and the index inclusion is a key driver. ""We believe 2019 will be a tipping point in China's bond market, as all four elements - regulation, market access, investor demand and benchmarks - are now much more firmly in place,"" said Peter Grauer, chairman of Bloomberg L.P."
1,"Zhang Shuoqi, a 31-year-old website editor who rented an apartment in Beijing for two years, recently became an intercity commuter. She now gets up at 5 every morning to commute between Tianjin and Beijing by train. In addition to a broken toilet and street noise late at night, the final straw that made her decide to move was that the rent on her 7-square-meter room would soon rise by 500 yuan ($73) to 3,350 yuan, more than 40 percent of her monthly salary. “The rent is too expensive. I’d rather live in my own home in Tianjin, which is larger and more comfortable,” she said. Cao Xiaofang, a saleswoman in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, was told she would have to pay an extra 1,000 yuan to continue living in the same apartment when her one-year rental contract expired in August. Although she had a 10-sq-m bedroom, Cao shared the kitchen, living room and restroom with six people, and often had to wait in line to take a shower. “Young people in Shenzhen are under pressure. Many of us live in small spaces like pigeon lofts,” she said. Li Ran, a 28-year-old brand planner, who rented in Beijing, said the rent accounted for 25 percent of her salary. “The salary of many migrants in Beijing is just about enough to ensure they don’t starve,” she said. Qian Junjie, a consultant in Shanghai, has just rented his house to several tea salesmen. He said he raised the rent by 2,000 yuan this year. “If I know others are asking for 6,000 yuan, why should I keep it at 4,000 yuan? I’m in debt, too. But I don’t mind giving a discount, say, 5,800 yuan, to have a stable tenant,” he said. About 190 million people in China are renters, and the figure is expected to reach 270 million by 2030, bolstering the scale of the rental market to 4.2 trillion yuan, according to data from Orient Securities. The rising rents in major cities, such as Beijing, Shen-zhen and Shanghai, pose challenges for migrants, especially the younger generation, to survive, and recently sparked a nationwide discussion about the rental market. According to Creprice, a website managed by the China Real Estate Association, the average per-square-meter rental in Beijing was 94.87 yuan in August, a year-on-year rise of about 21 percent. In Shanghai, the figure was 75.34 yuan, a 19 percent rise from last year, while the rate in Shenzhen was more than 25 percent. Liu Weimin, a researcher with the Development Research Center of the State Council, China’s Cabinet, told Xinhua News Agency that part of the reason for the rising cost is that real estate agencies are eager to expand their scale as more capital flows into the rental market. In January, Ziroom, a major online apartment rental platform, completed financing of up to 4 billion yuan. Danke, another real estate rental operator, received financing of $100 million this year. Wen Ming, a former real estate agent and a subletter in Beijing for more than 10 years, said many of the companies raised rental costs to persuade homeowners to sign agreements with them. “They thought if they acted for many clients, they could decide rental as they wanted,” he said. “It’s a regional monopoly.” He added that the competition for homes is not just happening among companies, but also within companies. “Each store has a KPI (key performance indicator) system, decided by the number of houseowners they have signed.” The rumor became public when Hu Jinghui, former vice-president of 5i5j, told the media that major rental service operators were competing to get homes by raising rental fees. He left the company soon after, and two companies he had mentioned refuted his comments. In late August, 10 rental companies announced that they would not raise rental fees unnecessarily and promised to release more than 120,000 houses to provide a stable and healthy rental market, as organized by the Beijing real estate agents association. Daniel Yao, head of research at JLL China, a provider of real estate services, said the recent surge in rental prices indicated strong demand for leasing homes, especially from young people. More millennials have started to flow into the labor market, and they are more willing to rent rather than buy, given the high property price and tightened purchasing policy, he said. To solve the problem, the supply of rental houses should be increased by making full use of the stock of real estate, he added. Some hotels, shopping malls and office buildings that have performed poorly could be renovated into rental apartments, Yao said, adding that information provided should be more transparent for both landlords and tenants. For example, tenants with high individual credit could be given a discount in rental or other favorable terms. Besides, the recent reform of personal income tax provides a certain deduction for people with children in need of education, and for expenses to pay for treatment of serious illnesses. Maybe the same rules could benefit tenants, too, he said. Wang Jia, a partner at Roland Berger, said rents would rise in the long term due to the process of urbanization and economic development. But the rise will be stable under macroscopic readjustment and control from the government. He said since the country has successfully regulated the real estate market — to avoid speculation and a housing price surge — the future of the rental market is positive. “Efforts should be made to fight dishonest intermediary agents and speculation,” he said, adding that companies should innovate their products to improve services to customers."

We also signed a strategic partnership agreement with China FAW Group to elevate our cooperation to a new height. Faurecia keeps faith in the great prospect of China’s economic development in the coming years. First, the innovation-driven development strategy and further opening-up policy will fully invigorate the economy in the long run. China is setting its sights on becoming a technology and innovation leader, particularly in the domains of Internet of Things, zero emissions and artificial intelligence. Chinese OEMs are already pioneering technology innovation in many aspects, such as autonomous driving and HMI, which will drive sustainable development of the auto industry in the next three years. In addition, China will continue to adjust industry structure and build a modernized economic system to cushion downward pressure and remain steady economic growth.

From entering as a trading company to establishing regional headquarters for sales, manufacturing and innovation, ZEISS’s growth in China is aligned with the China market trends of being more open, inclusive and dynamic, thanks to the reform and opening-up policy. Since the establishment of the Shanghai FTZ (a symbol of China’s reform and opening-up), a substantial number of measures have been announced to further simplify the administrative process in many critical areas such as trade, tax and financial services. These have enabled ZEISS to increase our efficiency and lower costs to stay competitive in the Chinese market. For example, we have already achieved substantial improvements in inbound and outbound dispatching speed, with improvements of over 30 percent in reduction of working and processing time. In recent years, China's market has been continuously expanding in size and increasing market opportunities. Thanks to China's booming market, we have been able to leverage our strengths in global technical resources, diversified solutions and industry experience to carry out all-around cooperation with our partners. Alongside the country’s stabilized economy, the government’s plan is to push for high-quality social and industrial development. We have seen a lot of progress as the Made in China 2025, Medical Reform and national plan for scientific and technological innovation policies have been implemented. This is actually offering us a lot of growth opportunities as ZEISS is primarily active in healthcare, research, vision care and industrial quality. These are all sectors of the Chinese economy that are growing above the average. With full confidence in China’s long-term economic prosperity and vibrancy, ZEISS will take concrete action to fully integrate into the local ecosystem and grow with the Chinese market.,At the exhibition, Infineon showcases a vision for the life of tomorrow as our corporate slogan is ""Part of your life. Part of tomorrow"". We focus on the main topics ""smart car"", ""smart city"", ""smart factory"" and ""smart home"". We have live-action and interactive features at the booth, demonstrating how Infineon connects the real and digital world with advanced semiconductor technologies that make life easier, safer and greener. And I expect very fruitful meetings with customers at the CIIE. To name a few things we exhibit: There is an award-winning smart lighting solution that will make our cities smarter. And we have a really smart car, the Audi A8. Infineon supplies key components. The Audi A8 is the world's first series production car featuring level 3 automated driving. CIIE is a great opportunity for Infineon to demonstrate our technology leadership to a broader audience. It also helps to enhance our communications with local government and strengthen our collaboration with Chinese partners. We are convinced that it can bring attractive business opportunities to all of us. In the past few months, Infineon has been very active in participating CIIE related activities and that enabled us to yield fast and tangible results. I am very excited to tell you that we have already secured some business opportunities with local customers and I am quite looking forward to signing the deals at CIIE. Infineon is a world leader in semiconductors. The semiconductor industry requires heavy investments, and the making of a semiconductor usually involves several countries, tens of thousands of miles travelled and almost a few weeks' transit. So a fair trade and investment environment and an efficient global ecosystem would be essential. CIIE underlines China's strong commitment to open its door wider for trade and investment, and its great efforts to enhance cross-industry collaboration and communications. I am convinced that will eventually help drive our industry development. China's reform and opening-up policy has led to an impressive economic development. Infineon has been honored to witness, contribute to, and benefit from this policy. Since the establishment of the first entity in Wuxi in 1995, Infineon's business has been growing rapidly. With a turnover of 1,735 million euros, China accounted for about 25 percent of Infineon's revenue in the fiscal year of 2017. Infineon has established an entire value chain serving the Chinese market, covering R&D, manufacturing, sales, marketing and technical support. Our commitment to China is strong. We've been expanding our investment, and collaborating with local partners to drive industry development and transformation. For instance, we built a second factory in Wuxi in 2015 to offer stronger support to the rapid-growing local market; and in 2018, we joined hands with SAIC Motor to establish a joint venture to accelerate the growth of electro-mobility. In addition, we collaborated with Alibaba Cloud and JD.com on the development of Internet of Things; and with Tsinghua University for talent development. China has made great progress on its attempt of transforming the economy since President Xi Jinping came up with the concept of ""New Normal"". Looking into the next three years, I think ""high quality development"" will continue to be the major focus. As the economy develops, our society faces some challenges: the ever-growing population and the rising demand for energy. At the same time, the need to fight climate change calls for new solutions in our everyday life. How to connect the dots between economy and ecology will be the key issues that I will be watching for. Infineon is committed to addressing such challenges and contributing to China ""high quality development"", with our technologies that make life easier, safer and greener.,In addition to introducing Schindler's history, milestones and values, we will highlight our new technology solution – Schindler Ahead – which can connect all elevators, escalators and moving walks to the Internet, capture real-time data and use big data analysis and AI to predict maintenance needs. It can fundamentally change the existing way of maintenance and repair, providing better, more reliable service to customers, property management companies and end-users as well. Moreover, we will showcase the spirit of craftsmanship and quality which we have inherited from over 140 years since its foundation of Schindler in Switzerland in 1874. As one of the world's leading providers of elevators, escalators, moving walks and related services including installation, maintenance and modernization, Schindler was invited by the Chinese government to be part of this world-level gala. Our escalators and elevators move over 1 billion people per day. However, the fourth industrial revolution is now coming, we are looking for more cross-industry cooperation opportunities and we also want to use this stage to make the public be aware of Schindler's leading technology – Schindler Ahead, an innovative piece of Internet of Things – to achieve smart unban mobility. Schindler has been very active in infrastructure projects in China, like airports, metro lines, etc. A number of our customers in China over the last few years have expanded their business to other countries in Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa to participant in the Belt and Road Initiative. We believe CIIE will become one of the important factors of energizing modern industry's development. Schindler established the first Sino-Western industrial joint venture in 1980, just after the Chinese government announced the opening up and reforms of the economy. We are proud that we are growing together with Chinese economy and we are one of the first foreign companies to have contributed to and benefited from China's reform and opening up. During the past three decades, Schindler has built up its reputation of safety and good quality. We have won string market share in China. Many of our reference projects are well-known, such as, Shanghai Tower, 2010 Expo China Pavilion, China World Trade Center Tower 3, National Stadium, Shenzhen Tencent Tower, Shenzhen Ping An Tower etc. Despite the uncertainty of global economy, we are still confident in China's future economy. Schindler has frequently said that China is the ""second planet"" for Schindler. With the opening of the new escalator plant in 2014 and elevator plant in 2015 in Shanghai's Jiading district, and the relocation of Schindler Zone China head offices to Schindler City in Jiading in September 2016, Schindler is committed to providing leading technologies and excellent services to China market for a long run. As for the elevator and escalator industry, we will pay more attentions to the opportunities and challenges brought about by urbanization and aging population as well as aging buildings. Furthermore, the desire of Chinese people to improve their living conditions due to their increasing incomes has drawn our attentions in these years and this will be continued in the upcoming.,Novo Nordisk will display publicly available product information of 9 innovative medicines that are launched in China and are benefiting Chinese patients. This includes a new generation of long-acting insulin Tresiba and growth hormone Norditropin, both launched in China in 2018, as well as Victoza which entered the National Reimbursement Drug List in 2017. In addition, Novo Nordisk will also showcase several research literatures on new drugs that are launched overseas and are planned to be marketed in China in the future. We will also dedicate space in our exhibits to highlight the high prevalence of diabetes in China, the importance of early diagnosis and early and better treatment for better clinical outcome as well as an international initiative called Cities Changing Diabetes. We hope through our efforts to raise awareness of diabetes, its negative impact to health and social-economic burden if not managed well and to rally stakeholders in both public and private sectors to continue changing diabetes together. Novo Nordisk hopes to showcase our efforts, contributions and unwavering commitments to change diabetes in China for the past 24 years. We target to let more people understand the threat of diabetes and its heavy economic burden on society which encourages stakeholders to work together with us to change diabetes. We also expect to learn about the latest products, services, and ideas brought by pharmaceutical peers; understand the development of Internet technology, big data, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things and 5G, and their application to the pharmaceutical industry. In addition, we will also pay attention to the development of manufacturing, financial services, and logistics, as they will also have an important impact on our business. Yes. The China International Import Expo provides an open platform for all countries and major pharmaceutical companies to showcase themselves, exchange ideas and seek cooperation. Through this platform, we manage to learn about the latest products, services, ideas of pharmaceutical peers, understand the development of other technical fields, and apply new technologies to the pharmaceutical industry. Novo Nordisk will continue to work with the government and the healthcare community to promote awareness of diabetes and healthy lifestyle. On the other hand, we will integrate China into our global R&D system, and aim to realize simultaneous clinical research, new drug registration application and approval between China and the world, so that patients in China and access to our innovative medicines simultaneously as patients in other countries. In the next seven to eight years, Novo Nordisk plan to bring 10 innovative medicines to the Chinese market in various disease areas. China's pledge to further open up its market to foreign companies tremendously improves the economic development in China, making the Chinese market one of the most attractive markets in the world. The continuous open-up leads the healthcare industry to the direction of encouraging innovation, focusing on quality and emphasizing efficiency. We welcome this positive trend. Tresiba, which was launched in China in March this year, is a new generation of ultra-long-acting basal insulin analogue. It was in the fast-track priority review list during the drug approval process of the State Food and Drug Administration of China. As a result, the review and approval process of Tresiba was significantly accelerated. We take a quite positive attitude towards China's economy in the next three years. China is Novo Nordisk's second-largest market. To us, China market offers us a long-term growth opportunity. Our growth rate reached 6 percent last year and we aim to continue growing our business in next three years. China faces huge challenge from diabetes. According to China's Rules of Halves (the statistics report by IDF): more than 114 million people with diabetes, less than half of them know that, and around one-third receives treatment, and only about 13 percent of people with diabetes in China are being treated and effectively managing their diabetes. Fortunately, if we can achieve early diagnosis and better treatment, we will be able to help patient achieve optimal outcome and more patients can live normal lives with good quality.,In terms of performance materials, Merck has display solutions, surface solutions and semiconductors solutions. We will introduce our advanced performance materials used in electronics, smart device and automobiles. For the life sciences industry, Merck will present research, process and applied solutions and products, including Crispr (gene editing technology), lab water systems, cell counting and sterile sampling equipment, as well as a virtual reality system for customers to experience Merck's latest life science products and solutions. Merck decided to participate in CIIE for three reasons. The first is to showcase leading products and technologies from all our businesses - healthcare, life science and performance materials. The second is to strengthen relationships and dialogue with our Chinese partners. We value our partnerships with Chinese customers and the government and see the Expo as an opportunity to deepen and broaden those relationships. Thirdly, Merck is a company with a deep tradition in innovation. We've had many break-through products in our 350-year history. We launched our innovation hubs in February this year in China. The expo is a great platform to look for innovation partners, ideas and cross-sector opportunities that will ultimately lead to more breakthroughs for China. Industry upgrades are happening in every sector we are in. CIIE is not only a stage for companies to demonstrate products and technologies but also a platform for partners to build dialogues. It will help create understanding and shape future industry development. CIIE also comes at a really good time when we are in face of confusion about world trade. China is an important country for Merck, we're very committed to the country and look forward to further growth and opportunities to come. For Merck, China's opening-up has been transformative, creating tremendous demand and new opportunities across all our businesses. Take for example the pharmaceutical industry: urbanization, an aging population, and increased healthcare awareness have combined to create a surge of healthcare demand. At the same time China is becoming more open to new ideas and investors. These factors lead to China's demand for new medicines, new solutions and new ways of thinking. China aims to become the world' largest producer of displays and semiconductors. This ambition has positive implications for our Performance Materials business. Chinese manufacturers use our materials to give them a competitive edge in the world market. We are growing solidly along with our partners in all these areas. Our life science business is also seeing strong growth, driven by China's transformation from labor-intensive manufacturing to an innovation-driven economy. This shift is pushing investment dollars – both for Merck and industrywide – into research and R&D, which is great for our life science business. As a company operating in China for 85 years, Merck has great confidence in China's economy in the future. According to the ""13th Five-Year"" plan (2016-2020), China has strong needs in areas of healthcare, high quality food and drugs and solutions on environment protection where Merck can contribute with our products and innovations. Moreover, China is to transform from labor/manufacturing intensive development to innovation driven economy. This trend created a lot of investment on research, which leads to the fast development of our Life Science business here. Our commitment to China will not be changed in the foreseeable future and we will keep investing in every sector. We are also excited about what we're seeing in terms of Chinese innovation: from e-commerce to biosimilars development, it's having a big impact on our strategy. That is why we decided to open Merck innovation hubs in China.,Through our CIIE exhibition, we aim to showcase our full product portfolio from our diverse segments, ranging from pet care to confectionery/snacks and food. Our Mars Wrigley confectionery business is using this occasion to launch a new healthy snack brand, Kind. In the category of treats, we will highlight Starbursts and Maltesers Crispy which we introduced to China recently. Our pet care business showcases products such as our Sheba cat food and our brands Iams and Nutro. Our Royal Canin brand features a full line-up of new specialty products for adult cats of particular species and formulas created fo"

A report released by the China Tourism Academy and Airbnb, an international house-sharing service, said 45 percent of people surveyed reported trying home stays when traveling abroad, while almost 60 percent of those who had not used such services said they wouldn't mind trying them during future trips. More than 1,500 people in five Chinese cities - Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Xi'an - participated in the online survey.

1,"China's bike-sharing craze is causing parking chaos, traffic congestion and is a safety hazard. Bans on expanding cycle fleets in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Wuhan and Guangzhou, as well as eight other cities, have been wheeled out by local authorities. In the capital alone, there are 2.35 million shared bikes run by 15 companies with stacked parking on pavements and at road crossings causing havoc for pedestrians. ""It is necessary that the authorities put the brakes on shared bikes,"" said Li Hao, an analyst at iResearch Consulting Group in Beijing. Earlier last month, the capital's transportation management authority prohibited an increase of shared bikes on its roads. Another 12 cities followed suit, forcing the main players to consider expanding to untapped markets across the country, as well as abroad. Still, many small bike-sharing companies will go to the wall, squeezed out by the big boys such as Mobike Technology Co, Bluegogo and Ofo Inc. Mobike plans to improve its services and management structure in major cities. ""As competition in the bike-sharing market in first-tier cities becomes fierce, sophisticated, intelligent management and operations will be our focus,"" said Li Yuxian, vice-president of Mobike. ""We are aiming to improve users' experience and ease the urban traffic pressure,"" Li added. Mobike has rolled out a highly-efficient and professional operational team in Beijing. They dispatch bikes and handle parking black spots by using cloud computing and artificial intelligence, or AI, technology. The company has spent more than 3 billion yuan ($458 million) on big data, internet of things and AI. It is also gearing up to increase its global expansion plans. ""Establishing more cooperative relationships with municipal governments all over the world will be our next move,"" Li said. ""We aim to operate in 200 cities by the end of the year."" Mobike's wheel tracks can be found in 170 world cities, with the company owning seven million bikes, as well as having over 100 million customers. Apart from China, the firm's cycles can be found in London, Manchester, Florence, Milan, Singapore and Bangkok. For now, even profit has been put on hold as the company continues its global push. ""If we want to make money, we can, but making money is not our first goal,"" Hu Weiwei, co-founder and president of Mobike, told the media. ""Profit is not the most important goal for us at the moment,"" Hu added. ""We are focused on market expansion."" By July, major Chinese cities had reached saturation point. There were up to 70 bike-sharing brands with 16 million cycles on the streets for a customer base of about 130 million, figures from the Ministry of Transport revealed in the summer. Data such as this prompted Mobike's rival Ofo to focus on operating its existing fleet of canary yellow cycles after announcing a designated maintenance officer for each operating area. Big data analytics technology was used to enhance efficiency. Founded in 2014, the Beijing-based company is valued at more than $2 billion after raising $700 million in its latest round of financing in July. It has more than 10 million bikes in 13 countries globally and in September officially launched in the Czech Republic, Italy, Russia and the Netherlands. The company aims to roll out 20 million bikes in 200 cities across the world by the end of the year after moving into markets in the United States, the United Kingdom, Singapore, Kazakhstan, Thailand, Malaysia, Japan and Austria. ""Our platform was created with the ambition of improving the environment globally by introducing low-carbon transportation to urban dwellers,"" Dai Wei, founder and CEO of Ofo told China Daily. ""Ofo is committed to bringing our green service to every city in need of convenient short-distance travel solutions,"" Dai added. Back in China, Ofo and the rest of the bike-sharing companies need to streamline and improve their business models. Many are unlikely to survive in a cutthroat industry. Some will be taken over or merged, while others will simply disappear from the streets. ""Bike-sharing companies should standardize the management of bikes and upgrade their operational capacities,"" Li at iResearch said. ""Refined management will be the future direction. ""But we don't rule out the possibility that small bike-sharing companies will be shut down or acquired by other companies,"" Li added. ""There will be a reshuffle in the market."" During the summer, Wukong Bicycle, a startup based in Chongqing, became the first bike-sharing company to go bankrupt. It was quickly followed by 3Vbike, which was forced to shut down because of rising costs. Now, many small brands plan to shift to third- and fourth-tier cities. Chen Yuying, CEO of Guangzhou-based MingBikes, aims to curtail operations in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Guangzhou and Shenzhen by the end of this year and move into 50 third- and fourth-tier cities. ""It is difficult for new bike-sharing brands to enter first-tier cities where the authorities have banned any more shared bikes from being stationed,"" said Wang Chenxi, an analyst at internet consultancy Analysys in Beijing. ""The influence on major players Mobike or Ofo is limited, but it's a matter of life and death for small bike-sharing companies as it is evitable that some of them will be knocked out,"" she added."
1,"Six Chinese cities are among world's top 10 fastest growing tourism cities, according to a report by the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC). Chongqing with 14 percent annual growth rate of tourism revenue tops the list, followed by Guangzhou, Shanghai and Beijing. Shenzhen takes the 8th spot with 10.7 percent annual tourism revenue growth rate, much higher than the world average 4 percent and 5.8 percent for Asia-Pacific. The success of Chinese cities is largely driven by domestic business, as over 94.5 percent of spending in Chongqing comes from domestic tourists, and the revenue growth of tourism industry in these Chinese cities is tied to developments in the Chinese economy, according to the report. Chinese market clearly plays a dominant role in terms of future growth and overall size and as a main source market for destinations in the wider Asia-Pacific, the report said. The study covers 65 cities, 21 of which are in Asia-Pacific, and all the world's top 10 fastest growing tourism cities are in Asia. Besides 6 Chinese cities, other cities on the top 10 list are Manila from Philippines, Delhi from India, Kuala Lumpur from Malaysia and Jakarta from Indonesia. Let's take a look at the top 6 Chinese cities with the world's fastest growing tourism industry."

Statistics show that city residents made 3.51 visits to the movie theater on average last year, an increase of 11 percent compared with the year before. Box office revenue for all of China rose 13.45 percent in 2017 to more than 55.9 billion yuan ($8.6 billion), the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television said earlier this week. There were 6 domestic movies that earned more than one billion yuan ($150 million) last year. Twenty-six new movie theaters were built in Beijing in 2017, and 211 screens were added, according to the municipal administration. The capital city is planning to upgrade one-third of the movie projection equipment in rural areas in 2018, and pledged to build more movie theaters in the next five years."
0,"Running a bookstore nowadays might not be an easy way to make money. But some bookstores are determined to meet - if not defeat - the challenges of the digital age. The Page One bookseller already has three popular branches in the Chinese capital. It's just opened another one on Qianmen promenade, while trailing a 24-hour schedule. Qianmen pedestrian street in Beijing, near Tian'anmen Square, was renovated in 2009. But the street - with its mix of old Beijing culture and modernity - didn't become a major draw for either tourists or locals until recently. The new Page One bookstore is an example of the street's trendy modern flair. Just a few steps from the archway and the tram rails is the newly opened Page One bookstore. It brings an air of culture to the old commercial street. The peaceful atmosphere inside also provides an ideal space for travelers to take a rest while also enriching their minds.,Designed by the same architect as the so-called world's loneliest library in Beidaihe, this Page One branch is as much an architectural attraction as a bookstore. The white building is reminiscent of a traditional Beijing courtyard, while the ""black tower"" changes ""theme"" every month. This month's theme is children's books. Page One previously specialized in art design books and English titles. Now it has expanded into all categories. Literature, history, science, art, lifestyle, bestsellers, children... there's something for everyone. Christian Parreno from Ecuador came across the bookshop by chance. ""The interior architecture of the place is beautiful. I'm looking for some Chinese literature translated into English,"" he said. Visitor Liu Sha says, ""I liked to hang out in Qianmen when I was a kid. It's such a good thing that there is a bookstore here."" Student Song Yuxin also said, ""Although online bookstores are so vibrant, I still like the atmosphere of a bookstore, and the feel of leafing through the pages."" It seems no modern bookstore can do without its own cafe. The hope is people drawn in by the aroma will end up buying a book. Page One's cafe is on the third floor. Here, the best company for a cup of coffee would be a paper book. The store's windows act as frames for the scenery outside, which is full of traditional residential houses. You take in different views of the city while you roam through the store. Meanwhile, a plant zone brings some nature inside the building. In the future, the plants will also be for sale, providing another source of income for the bookshop. Many modern bookstores now let people read without having to buy. People can sit as long as they want, even all night.,But is a 24-hour bookstore necessary? Is it only for night owls to hang out and buy books? At 10:30 pm, there are still people in the store, even though only the first floor is open this late. Surprisingly, almost all the people I spoke to support the idea of a 24-hour bookstore. Visitor Lian Huabei says, ""I think it's absolutely necessary. There are 24-hour eateries, 24-hour bars, why not bookstores? I always sleep during the day and am awake at night. I'm the kind of person whose brain is more active during the night than daytime. Many writers or artists are nocturnal. A 24-hour bookstore might have no people. But you have to have one."" Visitor Li Kunduo says, ""I would come here after work. Read something to improve myself."" Graduate student Nier and her friend also think a city needs a 24-hour bookstore. ""This is very attractive to me. If I hang out late with friends, I would like to have a quiet place like this to stay for a while other than McDonalds."""

The report was conducted and released by the Center for China and Globalization (CCG) and the Southwestern University of Finance and Economics' Institute of Development Studies. A comprehensive evaluation system was used to value a region's competitiveness of international talents in six dimensions - scale and structure of international talents, and innovation, policy, development and living environments. ""With rapid economic globalization, China has become international talents' new choice for long-term development and relocation and regional competition for international talents has begun,"" Wang Huiyao, president of CCG,said.

1,"China will place tariffs on about $60 billion worth of imports from the United States in response to Washington's announcement of additional levies on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council said on Tuesday. Beijing announced on Tuesday its plans to slap additional tariffs on 5,207 categories of US products with two rate levels, 10 percent and 5 percent, according to a statement. The new tariffs levied by China will become effective on Monday. Analysts said that China is capable of sustaining stable expansion despite the impact of the US tariffs. The announcement came after the administration of US President Donald Trump said it will impose 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion worth Chinese goods starting Monday, which will then rise to 25 percent in 2019. The White House earlier threatened that if China hits back, it will immediately pursue further tariffs on about $267 billion of Chinese imports. China has to take countermeasures to ""safeguard the country's legitimate interests and the global free trade order"", the Ministry of Commerce said, adding that the US move brings new uncertainties to bilateral negotiations. China urged the US to recognize the negative consequences of its actions and redress its behavior in a timely manner, the ministry said. Geng Shuang, a foreign ministry spokesman, said talks on an equal footing are the only correct way to resolve trade issues, and ""insincerity"" is unacceptable. China and the US have raised tariffs on $50 billion worth of each other's products since July as their trade tensions escalated over the past few months. Wei Jianguo, a former vice-minister of commerce, said the two countries need to resume discussions as soon as possible to reduce losses for both sides and safeguard global trade order. William Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said, ""The best way forward is an imminent return to results-oriented negotiations."" Fang Xinghai, vice-chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said the latest US tariff actions will have a negative effect on the Chinese economy, reducing its GDP growth by about 0.7 percentage point. But he said that ""with ample room to maneuver fiscal and monetary policies, the Chinese economy is expected to remain stable"". Lillian Li, vice-president at Moody's Investors Service, said that fiscal and policy easing will largely offset these effects, leaving China's real GDP growth estimate unchanged. Some US states and cities have continued to show enthusiasm for furthering cooperation with China. On Monday, Michigan Governor Rick Snyder said in Beijing that his visit to China aimed to seek more cooperation with China's central and local governments. Snyder said the tariffs have impacted local US industries, like the automobile sector."
1,"On Monday this week, Shanghai welcomed 172 countries, and regional and international organizations to the first China International Import Expo. The event, billed to promote common prosperity through economic globalization, is the latest addition to China's opening up policy innovation, thrusting the world's second-largest economy into the role of the new frontier for goods and services from around the world. Welcoming the over 36,000 enterprises in Shanghai, Chinese President Xi Jinping maintained that the Expo was an exemplification of his country's affinity towards multilateralism and free trade. While the Expo has been termed a significant move by China to embrace foreign products and services, the big question in many African capitals relates to how the continent will make the best use of the opportunity. China and Africa share an impressive track record of increased economic ties. As the biggest trade partner for Africa since 2009, China has consolidated its economic foothold on the continent where it also ranks as the top investor. According to the China Africa Research Initiative at Johns Hopkins University, the value of trade between the two entities peaked at $215 billion in 2014. Impressive as the numbers show, the resulting trade between China and Africa is heavily lopsided in favor of China. Much of the exports from Africa were raw materials, while imports from China into the continent were exclusively finished products, including machinery, household products, electronics and agricultural imports.,The newly-launched Expo is therefore a good opportunity for China and Africa to integrate what is workable and how best to harness the existing potential towards a win-win in trade relations. Already, data from various sources indicate that African exports to China have been on an upward trend from a paltry $5 billion in 2012 to over $110 billion in 2014. A few suggestions would suffice at this stage. China and Africa need progressive economic partnership regimes that can facilitate entry of African products and services into the Chinese market. Such negotiations should transcend bilateral levels and embrace broader regional consensus between the two entities. Key among the action points should be eliminating cumbersome tariffs that have impeded imports from Africa. Secondly, there is a need to diversify the types of products that China welcomes into its markets from Africa. Besides natural resources, Africa is home to a plethora of other products, including flowers, vegetables and beverages that it could sell to China. Africa also should aggressively market new sources of comparative advantage, such as tourism, to the Chinese market. The continent has proven popular with the burgeoning Chinese middle class, something that could provide the much-needed shot in the arm to right the wrongs of lopsided trade imbalance. Finally, Africa should leverage the Forum on China Africa Cooperation to further buoy its exports to China. In August 2018, President Xi pledged $5 billion to support African imports into his country, a move that created impetus on the side of African countries. Seen from the Belt and Road Initiative lens, China is increasingly opening its borders to the rest of the world. Africa should therefore roll out innovative and sustainable measures to effectively trade with Beijing."
1,"WASHINGTON - Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Christine Lagarde warned Thursday escalation of trade conflicts risk reversing the current upswing in global economic growth, urging countries to negotiate regulations in a cooperative manner. ""The momentum behind the cyclical global expansion remains strong, but escalating trade conflicts and financial market volatility highlight downside risks beyond the next several quarters,"" Lagarde said. The head of the global lender made the remarks as the IMF and the World Bank convened this year's annual spring meetings against the backdrop of widespread trade disputes that the United States has been ratcheting up against its major trading partners worldwide in recent months. ""Countries should work to promote an open and rules-based multilateral trade system that works for all ... A cooperative approach to regulation will reap the benefits of financial technology, while addressing risks to stability and integrity,"" she said. Expressing her concern over the unabating buildup of what could lead to a full-blown trade war between Washington and Beijing, Lagarde called on countries to ""steer clear from protectionism,"" saying that ""unilateral trade restrictions have not been proven helpful."" The IMF chief said that she welcomes bilateral discussions between Washington and Beijing and that disagreements should be resolved at multilateral settings. According to Lagarde, the spill-over effect of China-US tit-for-tat tariff measures around the world will be limited since the impact on growth is ""not very substantial"" in terms of global gross domestic production, which is expected to grow 3.9 percent this year. However, she reminded international finance officials at the meeting, however, that the trade fight between the world's top two economies will cause an erosion of business confidence that is immeasurable. ""It is more difficult to measure the erosion of confidence. When investors don't know the terms on which they are trading, they are reluctant to invest. Growth is being driven by more investment and trade, so why damage those engines?"" said Lagarde."
0,"A new way of riding a bus — hailing a bus online and waiting until a certain number of people around your location make the same request — will soon be available to the public in Beijing according to Beijing Public Transport, Beijing Youth Daily reported on Tuesday. People living in densely populated residential areas were the primary focus when the bus-sharing service was designed, and routes from these areas to companies, business districts and transportation centers will be provided. Based on the routes, a comprehensive network of public bus service will be mapped out with smart bus technology and big data platforms. Compared to the existing model of bus riding, the bus-sharing service features customization and flexibility. Passengers could upload their individual needs for bus rides on the internet and wait to be picked up by a public bus when it gathers enough people. In this way, bus riders will no longer need to waiting at a station or sit through a pre-defined bus journey. ""Public bus-pooling is mainly designed for temporary and irregular traveler. It is something like online car-hailing services, but with greater transport capacity,"" said Xu Kangming, an expert specializing in transport. ""The more flexible bus services, including bus-hailing, will better meet the travel demands of citizens and effectively ease the traffic tension,"" he added. However, increased capacity also makes it harder to gather enough passengers. Algorithms for higher accuracy or other advanced technologies should be put in place in the future to further improve services for citizens' convenience."
1,"The administrative committee of Zhongguancun science park - known as Beijing's Silicon Valley - will provide money and floor space for companies to operate 10 platforms designed to commercialize scientific research findings as part of an effort to make the capital a center of innovation. The committee and the Chinese Academy of Sciences have published a series of measures to attract and guide specialized talent to help add technology to products. This year, Zhongguancun plans to build 10 commercialization platforms by offering subsidies for talent, hardware facilities and workspace, said Zhao Huijun, deputy director of the committee, on Thursday. ""We will help with innovative management, operations and the service model for platforms,"" she said. ""The platforms will hire professionals to assess the scientific findings, apply for patents and conduct market research."" To attract talent, the platforms will provide competitive pay, the authority said, and will offer bonuses based on the commercialization of those platforms. Yin Hejun, vice-mayor of Beijing, said the city needs to maintain a high-end economic structure to realize innovative development, as innovation requires the city to make better use of existing scientific research institutions and accelerate the commercialization and industrialization of the findings. ""The capital has been closely cooperating with the CAS, which has built a great foundation for future development,"" he said. Zhang Xingsheng, deputy head of western Beijing's Mentougou district, said the district will provide up to 5 million yuan ($750,000) in startup funds for high-tech companies. Zhongguancun, together with the Beijing government, has been helping startup companies and high-tech research groups through preferential policies. Chen Tianshi from the CAS Institute of Computing Technology - and who is also CEO of Cambricon Technologies Corp, a startup specializing in artificial intelligence and AI chips - said it is only through help from the CAS and Zhongguancun that technology can be transferred into real products. ""I feel very grateful to everyone involved. Thanks to their help, our technology and findings didn't stay on paper but were put into products,"" he said. ""Two years ago, we started research and development on AI chips that are now inserted into millions of mobile phones. I'm glad we used the technology to serve the public."" Zhongguancun will also provide funding for some ongoing projects and further open up resources, including R&D centers and labs for sharing. By the end of this year, the CAS and Zhongguancun will establish a database for scientific research results, which will be used for further selection and commercialization."

A larger snowfall is forecast in the next three days, the municipal meteorological bureau said. According to the bureau, it started snowing at 5:36 am in Yanqing district, the city's northwest mountainous area. It marked the second snowfall this winter in Beijing, but one that was much larger than the first snow on Feb 6, data from the bureau showed. Beijing issued a yellow warning on icy road conditions Tuesday morning, which is the lowest level in the three-tired warning system of yellow, orange and red. Most road traffic in Beijing was unaffected, but some public transport lines were suspended, including five bus lines running through the city, according to the Beijing Municipal Commission of Transport. Beijing Bus Group also launched an emergency plan to put 200 vehicles on the road and send more than 2,000 personnel to strengthen transport inspection. The city's transport authorities also reminded residents to drive slowly during peak hours on roads that easily freeze."
0,"China has over 20 million ""empty-nest"" youths aged 20 to 39, and most of them live in major cities, according to a report by China National Radio (CNR). Beijing, Shenzhen, Shanghai and Guangzhou are home to the biggest number of empty-nesters. They are young singles who live alone to work usually in cities. People with ""empty-nest"" syndrome used to refer mainly to the elderly whose children have moved out from their homes. The term's definition has been stretched in China as more young folk live alone away from their hometowns. These young empty-nesters are often perceived as shut-ins who prefer to spend most of their time in their apartments. Their main way of interacting with others outside of work is through social media. Data from the National Bureau of Statistics show 12.45 percent of households in the country were inhabited by one person each in 2015, up by over four percentage points from 2008. Sichuan University sociology professor Wang Yimei, speaking to Xinhua, said the growing number of empty-nesters was a result of uneven social and economic development between big cities and small towns. Cao Fang, a 29-year-old in Beijing, bristled at the empty-nest label. ""Sometimes, I go for dinner or shop with my colleagues,"" She also spends plenty of days at home reading. ""I've lived like this for four years. I haven't found it unbearable."" According to data from online food delivery service Baidu Waimai, young people living alone have more money to spend on better food and clothes. And one in five young empty-nesters has no savings or is in debt. ""For the young people who have just graduated and aren't married, it's ordinary,"" said Dong Haijun, professor of sociology at the Central South University. ""They will have their own social hubs, which will not be bound by those of their parents,"" Dong said."
1,"BEIJING - China encourages exploration and opposes monopoly in developing autonomous driving technologies and products, the country's top transport regulator said Thursday. Failure can be tolerated but safety should be ensured during the development process, Li Xiaopeng, head of the Ministry of Transport (MOT), told a press conference. China attaches much emphasis on related technologies and applications as autonomous driving will help improve transport safety, efficiency, services and industrial development, Li added. Last year, China issued a guideline to regulate road tests of autonomous driving and another on closed testing ground development. Three sites, located in Beijing, Chongqing and Xi'an, have earned an official nod for such testing. Domestic internet and automobile firms have been investing in the frontier field. Tech giant Baidu launched an open platform named Apollo in 2017 to coordinate cross-sector efforts in autonomous driving, which has been granted over 50 licenses for open-road testing of autonomous vehicles in cities like Beijing, Tianjin, Chongqing, Changsha and Baoding. The MOT will work with other departments to strive for national-level policies for guiding the sector's development, Li said. Efforts will also be made to facilitate the development of related rules and laws, promote pilot demonstration sites prudently and boost international cooperation, Li added."
0,"BEIJING - The shutters will close permanently at Beijing's largest clothing wholesale market, known by many as Beijing Zoo wholesale market, by the end of 2017.  The district government of Xicheng, Beijing, made the announcement as it called time on the 2,000-stall Wanrong mall in the zoo market late Monday.  Wanrong mall will be occupied by finance and hi-tech firms, the government said.  Built in the 1980s, the sprawling zoo market is loved by locals and outsiders alike for its expansive selection of sartorial products, many at rock-bottom prices.  At its height, the market had a dozen malls like Wanrong, with thousands of tenants and as many as 70,000 visitors a day. The rise of e-commerce had taken its toll on business even before the closure.  It was first announced in 2013 that the authorities intended to close the market, part of a wider push to upgrade Beijing urban functions. Low-end businesses will be moved outside the crowded capital.  The district government said seven malls in the market have been shut so far.  Officials said they will follow up on the promise to support vendors to relocate and underscored that their interests will be protected, and their businesses can grow.  About 5,000 vendors have signed deals to move to malls in cities of Shijiazhuang, Cangzhou, and Tianjin, according to the government.  Last year, Beijing relocated or repurposed 117 markets citywide. This year, another 120, which also include community food markets, will be moved or upgraded."
0,"BEIJING - The construction of Xiongan railway station was started Saturday with a goal to optimize China's high-speed railway networks covering Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei Province, according to sources from the China Railway. With a construction period of 24 months, the station is the biggest one among the five stations along the 92.4-km-long intercity railroad linking Beijing and Xiongan. The other four stations are Huangcun, new airport, Gu'an East and Bazhou North. Upon its completion by the end of 2020, the station will be connected with the country's five high-speed railways and intercity railroads, which will allow passengers from Xiongan New Area to get to Beijing, Tianjin in half an hour and Shijiazhuang, the capital of Hebei Province, in one hour. The project will also make Xiongan New Area a key transportation hub well connected with the central, southern, northwestern, southwestern and northeastern parts of China. Sources with the China Railway said international bidding for the station's design and construction plans had been completed, while construction experiences involving several domestic and overseas integrated traffic hubs have been drawn upon. A variety of intelligent design and construction technologies would be applied so that the station would be a signature upon completion, said the sources. In a master development plan for Xiongan New Area published in late April, the Chinese government described the new region as having ""national significance"" following the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone and Shanghai Pudong New Area. About 100 kilometers southwest of Beijing, Xiongan New Area, known as China's ""city of the future"" in Hebei Province, has been designed to become a zone for innovation, a digital city synchronized with a brick-and-mortar one, and a livable and business-friendly area. By the middle of the century, Xiongan will become a significant part of the world-class Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei city cluster, effectively performing Beijing's non-capital functions and providing a Chinese solution to ""big city malaise,"" according to the plan."

1,"The country's housing sector is becoming more rational as the property market continued to cool down in November, said experts. According to data issued by the National Bureau of Statistics, the nation's property market remained stable last month as local governments continued to battle speculation. Newly built commercial properties in first-tier cities edged up 0.3 percent in November compared to October, while secondhand property prices eased by 0.4 percent. Among China's 70 major cities, five－Tianjin, Xiamen, Shenzhen, Jinhua and Wenzhou－saw prices drop for new properties in November compared to October. Last month, 17 of the 70 cities saw a decline in secondhand property prices including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen. ""Prices for secondhand properties in 10 major cities have been decreasing for two consecutive months, and prices in the 70 cities have also seen significant change,"" said Zhang Dawei, chief analyst at Centaline Property Agency Ltd. ""It was the first time seeing this in four years,"" he added. Zhang predicted that over the next few months more cities will see cheaper secondhand properties, and new properties might also follow such a trend. Property research site Anjuke said the November numbers demonstrate a gradually stabilized market trend, though drops were relatively sharper in major markets. The number of properties sold in Guangzhou last month decreased by 34.9 percent from October, while Beijing and Shanghai also saw 14.3 percent and 13.9 percent drops, respectively. Zhang Bo, chief analyst at Anjuke, said amid the backdrop of stable policy, demand for properties in China has become more rational as more people decided to buy homes for living rather than for speculative purposes. But he didn't think the recent cooling down meant a prolonged slowdown. He said that according to Anjuke's research, 51 percent of homebuyers don't think the government will implement further policies to tighten housing prices, which meant both the consumption side and the property industry were becoming more rational. Land supply in first-tier cities was another solid sign that it is too early to talk about a prolonged market slump, said Zhang, as he noted the slow growth in the country's land supply to the property market in November. Li Tie, director-general at the China Center for Urban Development, believes there are more ways to bring down housing prices than simply tightening policy. ""With a population of 1.4 billion, it is absolutely normal to see high housing prices in Beijing and Shanghai,"" he said, adding that the biggest problem in the country's ongoing urbanization process was unbalanced public resource distribution, and there was huge potential in the country's urbanization efforts. He said more solutions can be applied to curb prices such as developing surrounding areas and improving the transportation infrastructure."

The film, based on the real-life story of a middle-school girls' football team in South China's Hainan province, is about their harsh training and how they won the Gothia Cup in Sweden from 2015 to 2017. Huang Jun, the president of the Beijing-based Children's Film Studio, says the movie marks the studio's return to making films for children after a decade. The studio, founded in 1981, is China's only film company to produce live-action movies for children and teenagers. Besides, it has also worked on translating and dubbing foreign movies for children. Huang also says that the studio assigned six scriptwriters to interview those involved with the team. Replying to question about the standard of the films produced, Huang says: ""To be honest, we have yet to become world class."" Meanwhile, Zhong Hai, the film's director, says he used drones to shoot some scenes, and recruited some members of the team to act in the movie. The movie may not be released in Chinese mainland theaters, but the producers plan to screen it in primary and middle schools and expect it to be seen by around 100 million students. The screenings, which began on Sept 10, will run for at least the next three months."

0,"China's environmental authorities have agreed in principle to pilot a cross-regional agency on air pollution in Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei and neighboring areas, 21st Century Business Herald reported Thursday. Liu Youbin, an official with the Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP), said Tuesday at a news conference that relevant work is underway, the newspaper reported. Liu said the agreement was reached at a meeting of the ministry in September. Though Liu did not specify when such an agency will be set up, an expert with the ministry said it will likely be established within this year, according to the newspaper. The idea to set up an integrated air management mechanism was first put forward in August, when 10 ministries and commissions including MEP and six province-level regions (Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong and Henan) jointly issued an action plan to address air pollution in areas around Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei for autumn and winter from 2017 to 2018.  According to the action plan, the preparation for the establishment of the air administration should be preliminarily completed and it should be put into test run by the end of Sept, aiming to improve cross-regional coordination, management and supervision in controlling air pollution and achieve integrated pollution prevention and control.  The air administration was part of the efforts made by the MEP to improve air quality and prevent smog.  According to Liu, the average density of PM2.5 in 28 cities in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and nearby areas went down 4.6 percent year on year to 62 micrograms per cubic meter from Oct 1 to Oct 27. The MEP said it will continue to step up measures to control air pollution to reach the targets set for this winter."

There are various kids' toys on the market. However, few people care about entertainment activities for the elderly. Most of them live their later life depending on television and mahjong, said Zhou Yanmin, sponsor of the event and a professor at Tsinghua University. ""The event is expected to fight against aging, make later life more colorful and provide opportunities for family reunion"", she said. ""I hope participants can design the games or toys by themselves with love."" Li Guoping, director of the sports medicine association of the China Sport Science Society, said: ""Cases showed interesting games help older people to recover from disease, rehabilitate, exercise and improve their sense of happiness.""  The format of competition entries can be one of many types, such as toys, board games, cards, sports activities and computer games, specially designed for people from 55 to 85. Participants should submit their entries before Aug 31, 2017, according to Zhou. Experts on chronic disease management, social work, rehabilitation and sports medicine will select 100 works through three rounds of evaluation, she said. According to the 2010 population census, 28.3 percent of the whole population of China was over 50 years old and the figure is set to surpass 50 percent by 2050. The demand for pension services is large in China due to the fast growth of a weaker, older population, such as the disabled and older people who live on their own, said an official from the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China.  Cheng Haijun, professor from Beijing College of Social Administration, said the government released a series of policies to target those problems, including the pilot projects concerning old age allowance, home-based care for the aged and a combination of medical treatment and endowment. Last year, 15 pilot regions were set up for long-term care, expecting to meet the demand of 40 million disabled or weak older people, he said.  According to the government report released this year, the future policies will focus on aspects including improving the quality of pension services, integrating the pension industry with tourism, culture, entertainment and fitness industries, and promoting the financing and investment in the pension industry, Cheng said.  During the 2017 Tsinghua Aging Industry Forum, one main forum and five sub-forums were held concerning the project's development, innovative management, investment and risk control, and public-private partnership in the pension industry. More than 2,000 domestic and overseas participants from the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan and Singapore attended the event.  The research achievements of Tsinghua University were exhibited for the first time at the event, displaying the establishment of the discipline, research results around the industrial chain and the commercialization of the university's scientific research.  A total of 28 essays collected from the country were published after the event.  The annual forum was hosted by six schools of Tsinghua University and supported by Beijing Tsinghua Tongheng Urban Planning and Design Institute, dating back to 2010, while about 9,000 attendees participated."
1,"The planned one-day pass for the Beijing subway system will boost tourism and be more attractive for international travelers, an expert said. Beijing subway will soon offer passengers more ticket options, with the one-day pass the first to be launched, the municipal commission of transportation said on Sunday. The capital now uses a metered fare system for subways. Passengers can buy single-ride tickets or use a rechargeable card. The one-day pass, valid for 24 hours of unlimited metro travel, will be convenient for visitors to Beijing and help boost tourism, the commission said. He Mang, assistant dean of the School of Tourism Management at Sun Yat-sen University, said cities like Shanghai, Guangzhou and Wuhan already have one-day or three-day passes, which allow tourists to save time and money. Beijing, as a global metropolis, needs to catch up to be more attractive and more influential. ""Inbound tourism is an important aspect of promoting high-quality development of tourism in Beijing. But the number of trips made by foreign tourists and tourism revenue in Beijing has continuously declined from 2012 to 2017. The one-day pass shows Beijing's effort to stay abreast of international tourism industry trends and a better understanding of the preferences of overseas tourists,"" he said. Rong Jun, spokesman for the commission, said the commission would analyze the commuter data during the holiday and figure out the needs of short-term visitors to Beijing before setting the ticket price. ""There should be a balance in the price of the one-day pass. It should be cheaper than buying single tickets. But if it's too cheap, it will divert the daily commuters and put more pressure on the subway,"" Rong said. The pass will be available in paper or QR code format, according to the commission. The city also plans to accelerate construction of three subway lines this year and will open three including the line connecting the new Beijing Daxing International Airport with the downtown district, the transportation commission said. Metro lines in Beijing are expected to have nearly 700 kilometers of rail in operation by the end of 2019. Authorities also said they will improve the ease with which passengers in the city's train stations can transfer to buses, the subway system or taxis."

0,"Works from the Leiden Collection made their China debut on Friday. The 74 old master paintings are on show at the National Museum of China in Beijing through September. Lin Qi reports.  Thomas Kaplan says he has never ""lived"" with any of the 250 paintings from his collection. The 54-year-old entrepreneur and investor from the United States, along with his wife, Daphne, have since 2003 put together one of the largest collections of 17th-century Dutch paintings in private hands.  They call it the Leiden Collection, after the city where many featured master painters were based, including Rembrandt van Rijn.  Kaplan says he has never seen his entire collection together. So, when he viewed an exhibition showcasing 30 of his paintings at the Louvre in February, he was ""shocked"".  ""People said you must be very proud(of the collection). I said pride has nothing to do with it. I didn't paint them.""  Also shocked were visitors, although they had seen many of the paintings at museums before.  The Kaplans have ""enjoyed"" anonymity for the past 13 years while lending their paintings to 40 museums.  ""In addition to being one of the most aggressive buyers of old masters, we've also been a lending library in Dutch art,"" says Kaplan.  ""The concept of sharing the collection has been part of our philosophy from the first day.""    The collection made its China debut on Friday. It features 74 paintings at the National Museum of China in Beijing through September, celebrating the most acclaimed period of the Dutch Golden Age. It will later move to the Long Museum in Shanghai.  The exhibition titled Rembrandt and His Time includes 11 works by Rembrandt and one by Johannes Vermeer.  ""Vermeer and Rembrandt are considered to be the two greatest geniuses of this period (the Dutch Golden Age),"" says John Stainton, deputy chairman of Christie's old master paintings department, who was at the Beijing opening.  Kaplan purchased works largely through dealers and also at auctions by Christie's and Sotheby's. Between 2003 and 2008, he bought on average one painting every week.  ""Our desire is to build a collection of the best of its kind.""  Speaking about the Kaplans' quest, Stainton says: ""There are a good number of Dutch 17th-century paintings in private hands. The very best of them are relatively few. But there are still very fine works that come to the market.""  He says the exhibition is important to helping people understand what was going at the time in the Dutch Republic (1581-1795), which is now the Netherlands.  ""It was a new republic, so the people felt very free for the first time. Commercially, there was a burgeoning wealthy middle class. And artistically, one saw an explosion of creative talent, with this middle class commissioning and buying artists' works,"" Stainton says.  ""It fostered an environment in which artists could really flourish. That is why it was a high point of European old master painting when there was so much creative talent in a relatively short period.""  The exhibition also features Jan Lievens' Boy in a Cape and Turban, the collection's first loan. It was displayed at Los Angeles' J. Paul Getty Museum in 2004 and'05.  Kaplan says he saw in the audience a young girl visiting with her class.  ""She was so mesmerized by the painting that she was standing there (in front of the painting) alone while the rest of her class walked on. From that moment on, I realized that it's all about sharing our paintings,"" he says.  Kaplan says loaning his collection helps to bridge cultures just like Rembrandt did. He says that for many people, art is a pass to different kinds of social acceptance and power, but that is not important to them.  ""We believe Rembrandt, almost uniquely, lends himself to being able to build bridges between cultures. We don't view him as being an instrument of cultural imperialism,"" he says.  ""And one being able to see Rembrandt is a means of showing what unites us, much more than what divides us.""  The collection launched an online catalog in January for people who are interested in information on the 175 works and articles written by museum curators.  ""People tell me what a useful tool it is, and it is the reason why very early on we decided we didn't want to do a book. We wanted to be democratically available for students, curators, collectors, auction houses, dealers and historians,"" says Kaplan.  ""With the privilege of being able to own it comes the responsibility of magnifying it for the benefit of the public.""  He says he believes that China will become a major factor in the enduring appreciation of Europ's old masters (painters before about 1800).  ""In so many areas of today's world, I see China as being the future. I'm not alone in saying that. It's a cliche,"" he says.  ""But some of the areas in which I predict China is the future are not necessarily unanimously viewed to be the case.One of them, as I believe, is that China is clearly making a huge impact on the art world.""  Stainton from Christie's says that they've seen an enormous growth in buying interest in old masters from Asia, especially China, in the last five years.  He says half of the six bidders were Asian when it auctioned in London a painting by Peter Rubens that had been previously exhibited in Hong Kong last summer.  ""That would not have happened 10 years earlier and maybe even five years ago.""  9 am-5 pm, closed on Mondays, through Sept 3. 16 East Chang'an Avenue, Dongcheng district, Beijing. 010-6511-6400."
0,"Leading composers say China's music scene has improved with the reform and opening-up, Chen Nan reports. In 1978, China launched economic reforms that subsequently touched different aspects of citizens' lives, including music. A year earlier, the national college entrance exam resumed－after the ""cultural revolution"" (1966-76) had ended－and the Beijing-based Central Conservatory of Music, which also reopened then, set up four student-enrollment offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Chengdu, attracting over 170,000 applicants. But only 105 students could be admitted to the school in 1977. The six teachers of the conservatory then, including Li Chunguang and Yang Jun, wrote a letter to the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, asking for permission to increase the intake of students. Two days later, Deng replied, saying he had agreed to their request. The number was raised to 213. ""The teachers wrote the letter because they saw many talented youngsters at the audition and hoped that the young people would get the opportunity to study in the school,"" said music conductor and president of the Central Conservatory of Music, Yu Feng, during a forum at the school on Dec 10, marking the 40th anniversary of the reform and opening-up. ""It helped define an era of China's music scene."" Two concerts were held at the National Center for the Performing Arts on Dec 10 and 11, with performances by the Central Conservatory of Music Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Chen Lin, a student of Yu. They showcased China's achievements in classical music over the past 40 years. The repertories featured pieces by graduates of the conservatory, who are world-renowned musicians today, including Extase for oboe and orchestra by Chen Qigang, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon by Tan Dun and Horizon, Op 20, for soprano, baritone and orchestra by Ye Xiaogang.,The renowned Chinese composers, Ye, Tan and Chen, who enrolled at the conservatory to study music composition in 1978, gave speeches at the forum, recalling their school days and sharing their understanding of the changes in the country's music scene both as witnesses and creators. ""Western classical music started taking root in China less than 100 years ago and has achieved a lot, especially since the reform and opening-up started,"" says Ye, 63, who was born in a musicians' family in Shanghai and started learning the piano at age 4. Now, he is the chairman of the Chinese Musicians' Association and a professor at the Central Conservatory of Music. He initiated the Beijing Modern Music Festival 16 years ago. Ye came to Beijing when he was 23 years old and began his studies at the conservatory. He worked in a factory in Shanghai for six years before that. ""We benefitted from the reform and opening-up, and the resumption of the national college entrance exam. Now, Chinese musicians perform internationally. Looking back, the year 1978 laid the base for China's rise on the global stage,"" says Ye, adding that the originality and creativity of Chinese composers has been among the important changes in the classical music scene in China in the past four decades. ""The merger of Western classical music and Chinese culture has made the works of Chinese composers unique,"" Ye adds.,New York-based composer Tan, 61, who was born in Hunan province and joined a local Peking Opera troupe before he went to study at the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing, says his favorite place as a student at the conservatory 40 years ago was the library there. ""I read books and scores in the library after classes. So did my classmates. We wanted to learn, to practice and to test our musical ideas. Now, I want to know what the young students read."" Tan's works cover various genres, including orchestra, opera and film scores. One of his most famous works is composing the Oscar-winning soundtrack of Ang Lee's 2000 film Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Tan recalls that his years at the school introduced him to a wide range of international classical and contemporary music, which laid the foundation for his future experiments that transcended style and cultural boundaries in composition. ""Now my elder son is interested in movies while my younger son, who is 12 years old, loves music. He reminds me of my younger days and I am grateful for the life-changing experience 40 years ago,"" Tan says."
0,"Joe Sinicki would have mistaken Carrie Feyerabend for a Chinese performer, had he not watched her presentation of the Peking Opera classic, The Heavenly Maid Scatters Blossoms, at a recent show at the State University of New York in Buffalo. ""She did pretty well. If I didn't see her, I would have thought she was maybe a Chinese girl,"" says Sinicki, who is a fan of Peking Opera. ""It was cool. I liked it. It was very abstract. There's a lot of symbolism,"" says Sinicki, who was enthralled by Feyerabend's dance with shuixiu, literally meaning ""water sleeves"", one of the most skillful stunts in Peking Opera. Shuixiu refers to the extra-long dancing sleeves attached to the cuffs of a costume, which are used to perform various movements. There are hundreds of gesticulations in shuixiu dancing such as quivering, throwing and wagging. Feyerabend is an American artist from the Confucius Institute of Chinese Opera at Binghamton University who joined her Chinese counterparts in the show, Amazing Chinese Opera, which was held during the university's International Education Week in November, an annual initiative to celebrate and promote international education and exchange. Founded in 2009, the institute is the first such place in the United States to offer Chinese opera lessons through cooperation with the National Academy of Chinese Theater Arts in Beijing, while supplying tools and support for teaching Chinese language and culture. Regular shows Brought up in Skaneateles, a small town in New York state, Feyerabend studied Peking Opera in Beijing and now serves as an assistant to the director of the Confucius Institute at BU and is the only US member of its eight-person troupe. ""I enjoy playing that role,"" says the 26-year-old, who's the Peking Opera performer, anchorwoman and artistic director of each show. ""I like being behind the stage and helping people make sure that they have a good performance. I'm just so proud of the work that they do. It's fun to watch. Every single time they make it look effortless."" Apart from the onstage work, Feyerabend helps in designing the troupe's repertoire, including Peking Opera acts, Chinese folk songs and traditional music such as guzheng (Chinese zither) and dizi (flute). The troupe has staged nearly 100 performances in more than 30 US states since 2009. In order to better entertain local audiences, Feyerabend and her colleagues look to develop a good mix of music and Peking Opera, and give variations of different scenes from opera plays while making an individual act no longer than 10 minutes. Feyerabend has been working at the institute for more than three years. A large part of her job is preparation work to ensure that all is set for the troupe to perform across the country.,""It's an administrative role, so there's a lot of paperwork that goes on behind the scenes,"" she says. ""Being able to help out backstage logistically is really great when everything flows and goes right."" Myth unveiled ""CICO is the one and only Confucius Institute named for Peking Opera among its counterparts in the US,"" says CICO director Chen Zuyan. ""Our courses are fully integrated into the university's academic system."" All of CICO's courses are offered for college credits. Such courses cover Chinese culture, Peking Opera, Chinese musical instruments and Chinese opera stage combat. Justina Baez, a biology sophomore who chose the Peking Opera face painting course, says she was ""caught off guard"" the moment her Monkey King mask painting was complete. ""I was like, 'Oh my God!' My face just transformed. How did that happen?"" Baez says with a laugh. ""It definitely takes you into another culture and I think that's really cool. Being able to embrace a culture that's not really yours through face painting-I really like it."" The significance of such classes, Feyerabend believes, lies in the fact that ""they can fuel passion and also help mutual understanding develop"". CICO also holds outreach events throughout the year at large shopping malls and schools in other states, including Peking Opera shows, interactive workshops and exhibitions. In a recent exhibition CICO held at a local high school in the state of Montana, where they interacted with a group of theater students, they extended the event from one hour to two. The feedback of the local students impressed Feyerabend. Some students told her they would share the new skills with their parents. ""So it's a good way to inter-generationally share the culture and a more organic way than just sitting in a classroom."" Resources beyond Despite her major in Spanish at BU, Feyerabend chose to learn Chinese, because, as she put it, ""it was a difficult language"" and she wanted to challenge herself. Standing out for her excellence, CICO picked Feyerabend to participate in Chinese Bridge, or the Chinese Proficiency Competition for Foreign College Students, three times, from which she obtained two opportunities to study in China. The second time she participated in it was in the beginner's round in her sophomore year, and she won first place and gained the opportunity to go to China to study Peking Opera at the National Academy of Chinese Theater Arts in Beijing for a semester. ""I could feel myself growing both in my speaking and in my stage presence,"" she says. Later, she won the senior-level round in the US, then went to compete in Changsha, capital of Central China's Hunan province, to finally win a Confucius Institute scholarship, through which she ended up studying at Xiamen University in East China's Fujian province. According to Feyerabend, learning Chinese culture has not only facilitated her interactions with Chinese people, but also helped her connect with people from all over the world. ""It's definitely an interesting point of conversation, especially with Chinese co-workers and people that I've met,"" she says. ""I personally try to live by the guideline that you can't judge a book by its cover. You never know what's lying underneath. ""The only way to know is to have conversations with people, get to know their story and get to know their background."""

This year, 668 films made by college students from home and 26 countries and regions were received for the final round competition. Hundreds of thousands of youngsters from over 600 universities were involved in the event. The judging panel included famous director Martin Campbell and Chinese host He Jiong. Talking about the most salient features of this year's works, Zhong Danian, vice-president of Phoenix Satellite Television and doctoral supervisor of the CUC, said that for one thing, they reflect the observation of young filmmakers on current society, for another, their focuses are mainly on the stories happening around them. This year's Best Work of the Year went to Dave Zhang, a student of USC School of Cinematic Arts. His science-fiction film Cupcake tells a story of a high school girl, Yui, who makes cupcakes as part-time job, and a tech nerd, Kazuhiko. There was a special award: Best Middle School and High School Students' Documentary, aimed at encouraging young teenagers to make films on their own. In this year's ceremony, the award went to two under 18-year-old high school student directors, Song Yuanfeng and Zhao Wenrui, from Beijing National Day School. The Vision Youth Awards made its debut in the year of 2003, when SARS, a deadly respiratory disease, attacked Beijing. Students at the CUC recorded the glimpses of the era in films, and have held the awards for 16 consecutive years."

Such a renewable energy adoption level will be the highest among all airports in the country, according to the Beijing Municipal Commission of Development and Reform. The new airport, which is scheduled to be put into operation in 10 months, has adopted photovoltaic solar energy on roofs of the parking structure and business jets hangar while the geothermal energy will be used in service facilities for airfield. Particularly, the distributed solar energy generation system will provide 6.1 million kilowatt-hours annually for the airport, which will account for 1 percent of the total energy consumption. In addition to the renewables, traditional power plants and natural gas will also supply energy for the new airport."

They are national musical stars in Ecuador, this is however their debut in China. The performance reached its climax when Chinese cellist Zhang Bo took to the stage of the Rose Bud Arts Center, joining them in performing   (Clay Pot)- a representative song of the Ecuadorian folk rhythm  . It depicts the age-old Ecuadorian ritual of burying ashes of ancestors in clay pots to memorialize the deceased, an essential part of Ecuadorian culture. The lyric reads, ""I want to be buried like our ancestors, in the comfortable and dim confines of a clay pot..."" Their bow in Beijing consisted of three shows from May 24 to 26, each 40 minutes long. The set list covered classics like   and (Wandering Pigeon), as well as a new romantic song written by Agni Durder,  (Beautiful One). Also featured at the three-day Latin American and Caribbean Carnival were artists from more than 10 other Latin American countries. The carnival was part of the 2019 Meet in Beijing Arts Festival.,Speaking about representing her country at the carnival, the Manabi-born singer said she is excited. ""I hope through our performances, more Chinese people could know about traditional Ecuadorian music,"" she said in an interview with China Daily on Friday. ""Traditional Ecuadorian music is very pure and touches the heart, and I want to to promote traditional tunes,"" she said, as traditional music around the world is gradually losing audiences to pop. Seven years ago, the trio took the Ecuadorian musical scene by surprise via infusing traditional tunes with electronic music, rock and pop, bringing the country's folk music types such as Pasillo, Yaravi and San Juanito, to greater appreciation among the young generation. Since their debut in 2012, their music videos have garnered millions of views on YouTube, creating big hits including   and . They have toured in countries including the United States, Mexico, Colombia and Peru.,Durden said musical cooperation is a means to enhance intercultural exchange, and cooperation with Chinese musicians in Beijing will not be a one-off, adding he is expecting more in the future. ""There are many things in common between traditional musics almost everywhere in the world. When you listen to traditional Chinese music and Latin American music, it's not hard to find them familiar,"" said Durden. ""We want to find common ground...We will try to make this happen again in Ecuador, such as performing traditional Chinese music with arrangements that sound Ecuadorian [next time]."" For cellist Zhang Bo, who worked at the China Philharmonic Orchestra and is now a teacher with Minzu University of China, the collaboration was a great opportunity for musicians of the two countries to get to know more about the other's music and culture. ""It's my first time playing Ecuadorian music. During my four and a half years studying in Texas in the United States, I was exposed to a lot of Latin American music. Compared to other Latin American countries, I think Ecuadorian music is more restrained, but also very strong emotionally,"" Zhang said. ""I can feel the common ground while playing (Ecuadorian music). Chinese culture is known for its warm-heartedness and hospitality, and Ecuadorian music is restrained yet affectionate as well,"" he said."

0,"Editor's note: In the run-up to the 19th Communist Party of China National Congress, China Daily is reporting on a number of key projects of national importance that showcase the country's great improvements in crucial fields, such as recent reforms aimed at improving living standards and creating a moderately prosperous society by 2020. Today's report focuses on changes to China's medical system.  Despite appeals by his superiors, gynecologist Kang Kai was determined to resign from the hospital in which he had worked for nearly 20 years.  He said he left ""for freedom and respect"".  Kang, 45, worked at a leading public hospital in Chongqing, Southwest China. In the eyes of his colleagues and patients, the gray-haired doctor was eminent and respectable, but he describes himself as a slave: working around the clock, with just half a day off each week and ""always ready for overtime"".  As head of the gynecology department, Kang was responsible for dealing with hundreds of administrative inspections, meetings, medical disputes and studies that took up a huge amount of his time every year for no extra pay.  He also dealt with strained doctor-patient relations that could result in violence. Kang was even threatened twice himself.  ""It was very disheartening,"" he said. ""I didn't want to work that way.""  In 2015, he moved to Beijing and became a freelance specialist, seeing patients at different hospitals, mainly private ones. Last year, uniting about 100 leading doctors nationwide, Kang set up Woyi, which means ""fertile ground for doctors"", China's first group for gynecologists.  He is one of a growing number of Chinese doctors offering their services outside the public hospital system where they made their reputations. ""I feel like a fish swimming from a pond to an ocean,"" he said.  Giving doctors the freedom to choose where they see patients helps to tackle China's chronic imbalance in medical resources, according to Kang.  About 80 percent of the country's medical resources are found in big cities, such as Beijing and Shanghai, and 30 percent of them are in big public hospitals, which are flooded with patients eager to see eminent physicians.  The process of seeing a doctor at a big hospital is a miserable one. The sick must line up overnight for tickets, competing with scalpers, whose prices can be 1,000 times the official fee.  The time a doctor has for each appointment is tight. Kang once saw as many as 80 outpatients a day, each for just 2 or 3 minutes. ""It was the only way to get away from work at a reasonable time,"" he said.  Doctors grumbled about ""being nailed to a chair all day"" without even time for a toilet break, Kang said.  He admires how medical staff in the United States and Europe can work for more than one hospital, either public or private. Moreover, thanks to the hierarchical medical systems in those regions, patients can receive high-quality services at nearby clinics.  In China, medical staff and facilities are in great demand, so hospitals struggle to attract and retain good doctors. In 1999, a law was passed that required doctors to be registered with one hospital, which would be responsible for their pay, welfare and professional position until retirement.  Doctors who were not registered with a medical institution were often considered quacks.  The regulations began to be eased in 2009, when the State Council published a plan that allowed doctors to offer their services at more than one hospital. In October, the government released the Healthy China 2030 blueprint to ""explore the practice of freelance physicians and doctor groups"".  Regulations issued in March also supported doctors who want to run their own clinics.Kang said allowing doctors to register at more than one hospital gives patients improved access to treatment, and helps underpaid doctors earn more, because they can work at private hospitals, which offer better pay than the public system.  Patients have lambasted doctors in public hospitals for commissioning needless scans and other tests to make more money.  However, Kang pointed out that an appointment at a public hospital with an associate senior doctor, such as himself, would cost 15 yuan ($2.20) - less than a haircut - and he would receive a ""negligible"" share of that.  In private hospitals, a consultation costs 450 yuan, and he receives half of the fee.  Kang admits he had no idea how much a consultation should cost at first: ""We left the decision to the market.""  He used the example of a female doctor who often works late because her consultations last longer than those conducted by other colleagues. Even though her consultation fee has risen from 450 to 800 yuan, she still has many patients.  ""Doctors wouldn't take kickbacks,"" Kang said.  High fees discourage price-sensitive customers, but Kang argued that patients see doctors much more quickly than they would in a public hospital.  University teacher Jia Hong gave birth this year at a private hospital in Beijing. The medical bill was 30,000 yuan, more than 10 times that in a public hospital, but she didn't care. ""It's expensive, but it saves time, and I did not have to prepare a red envelope (a gift of money),"" she said.  However, few doctors are throwing off their ""shackles"". By last year, just 3,000 doctors had applied for extra registrations, less than 5 percent of the total number in Beijing. In Jiangsu province, only 1,000 doctors have applied since 2010.  Public hospital administrators have mounted strong opposition to the move, because they fear doctors will take patients and profits to private hospitals.  Last year, two ophthalmologists made headlines after being fired from a leading public hospital in Beijing for ""stealing patients"".  Doctors now worry that public hospitals will extract retribution by affecting pay, promotion prospects and professional titles.  Many doctors who joined Kang's group were persuaded to abandon their move by their hospital bosses.Another problem facing freelance medics is the lack of patients. During his toughest period, Kang had just one patient a day.  Zhang Qiang, a leading vascular surgeon from Shanghai who became the country's first freelance doctor, also suffered a loss of popularity: ""Before I quit the public hospital, I had about 200 operations to do, but when I ran my own business, only five patients followed me. It's really a big test for doctors.""  According to Kang, China's top hospitals are all State-owned, and they have the most-advanced medical equipment and the best-trained medical staff.  ""Despite offering all these services, doctors never learn, or need, to please their patients. After leaving public hospitals, they don't know how to compete in the market. We have to be nice to patients, because they are customers,"" he said.    To reach the public, freelance doctors are taking to social media and apps to popularize medical science.  More than 2,000 healthcare apps are available to enable users to contact doctors either by instant message or phone. Their conversations are open to other users, who can assess a doctor's services and skills at a glance, rather than by researching their qualifications. Some have millions of followers.  ""In the past, doctors waited for patients, but now we look for patients,"" Kang said.  While some experts predict that China will see an upsurge in the number of freelance doctors in the next 15 years, Kang said there's still a long way to go. ""Few people would pay more to see a doctor at a private hospital,"" he said.  Moreover, online consultation comes with the risk of misdiagnosis or disclosure of personal information. Patients often become angry at high fees, leading to disputes at private hospitals, which still require government scrutiny and regulation.  Duan Tao, a former president of the Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital and now a freelance doctor, urged public hospitals to reduce workloads by canceling unnecessary administrative meetings and inspections.  ""In a word, give time back to the doctors, and give the doctors back to the patients."""
0,"NEW YORK - In 1601, an Italian missionary named Matteo Ricci (1552-1610) entered the Forbidden City in Beijing, the Chinese imperial palace, opening a path for East-West cultural exchange that many people set foot on. Inspired by Matteo Ricci's legend, in 1986, Dionisio Cimarelli, aged 21 then, boarded a Trans-Siberian train to Beijing for the first time. ""China is one of my very old passion. Since I was a student, I was very interested in Chinese culture, Chinese art, Chinese people....so in 1986 I stopped my study in the academy and I decided to move to China for a big trip,"" said Cimarelli, who now teaches sculpture at the New York Academy of Arts. ""Matteo Ricci probably went to China to teach, but I went there primarily to understand, which was also my way to try to understand and exchange, and explain to the Chinese my culture, my education, and Chinese can teach me their own culture,"" he told Xinhua. China at that time was not yet fully open to tourism and streets of its cities were full of bikes, no busy traffic at all, he recalled. ""...in 1986, I found China a poor country, it was coming out from a very difficult time in terms of economy and culture. But in 1986 I was also able to see the beginning of the change after the opening-up,"" he said, referring to China's adoption of the policy of reform and opening to the outside world in 1978. Cimarelli returned to find a very different China in 2004 and he stayed nine years since in the booming country. ""I feel very lucky and I'm very very proud that I was able to see this change which would not only be part of China, but also part of the world change,"" he said. ""I saw huge change. From 1986 to 2004, China already changed a lot,"" he said. ""But during my nine years in China from 2004 to 2013, there was huge, enormous, amazing change. I was able to see every week the difference in Shanghai and Beijing, which I was going to very often. Continuously I saw the change,"" he said. ""I would say that in 2007 and 2008, there were the biggest changes in Beijing before the Olympic Games, I would say the change was 180 degree completely,"" he said. ""I could also see the change of people, the change of the attitude of the Chinese. They became more wealthy, they started to travel, they started to know. For the young people, they were able to do their Ph.D. in Europe and the U.S.A. So there are the enormous changes, you almost can't recognize the country, I would say,"" he said.,""China for me was an amazing experience, incredible. That's why I was able to stay for such a long time. It is because I've always been interested and curious and have always been learning the history and the mentality of the Chinese people, to understand them,"" said Cimarelli. In Beijing, Cimarelli met Situ Jie, a renowned sculptor at the Central Academy of Arts. He was then introduced to other professors and students at the academy. In 2006, he moved to Shanghai to work for a cultural institute. Soon his expertise and experience in China caught the attention of the Italian government which commissioned him to do a sculpture of Matteo Ricci for the Italy Pavilion at the Shanghai World Expo in 2010. ""Matteo Ricci was coming very close to my hometown. What he did was a bridge between the Western culture and the Chinese culture,"" Cimarelli said. ""So when they offered me this opportunity, I was really excited, I said, of course I would do it. I tried to make it something unique, something different which could represent Italy and represent China, Chinese culture as a bridge,"" he said. Cimarelli finally created a 1.5-meter-tall bronze sculpture of Matteo Ricci adorned with gilded calligraphy. The calligraphy in fact is Cimarelli's name written in Chinese characters. It took him six weeks to model and another twelve weeks to finish the sculpture which was collected by the Shanghai Italian Center in 2013 following the expo. Life in China also transformed Cimarelli's pursuit of art, making figurative sculptures in Chinese porcelain instead of Italian ceramics. ""When I made my series of porcelain, that was probably the most important learning, because I never did any porcelain before. I was coming from a culture of ceramic, Italian ceramics, which looks similar but is completely different,"" he said. ""So porcelain for me is an understanding of the culture of China, an understanding of a way of living, an understanding of a way of working. So for me to choose porcelain is a step forward closer to the Chinese culture,"" he said.,Italy is a nation in the West with cultural ties closest to China, Cimarelli said, it is no surprise that in China the two most famous historical figures from the West are Italian -- Marco Polo (1254-1324) and Matteo Ricci. He is confident that Italy, once an important terminal of the ancient Silk Road, would play a major role in the Belt and Road Initiative proposed by China in 2013. The initiative consists of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road, with an aim to build a trade and infrastructure network connecting Asia with Europe and Africa along and beyond the ancient Silk Road trade routes. Apart from the economics, Cimarelli said, the Belt and Road Initiative, just as the ancient Silk Road, serves for a deeper cause too, which is the exchange and understanding of cultures. ""I think primarily it's business. That was the same in the Middle Age when Marco Polo was travelling, that's the main purpose. But behind that, for me the culture is very important,"" he said. ""It would be like a way, a road along which you can do business with countries, but there is also cultural exchange which we need today,"" he noted. ""I think today we need more bridges than walls, we need more understanding than trying to avoid each other,"" he said. Cimarelli also expressed his hope that Europe and Asia would be soon connected by the high-speed rail that is commonly seen all over China. ""They did in China several huge projects with the train, like the one from Beijing to Lhasa (in west China's Tibet region). I really hope they can do that (between Europe and China) because that would be an amazing and incredible trip, and I would really enjoy it. I hope I will not be too old to wait for that,"" he said."
0,"Ye Ziyi has been obsessed by the cosmos since 2003, when she joined an astronomy club at age 15 and was given the opportunity to visit an observatory in the Beijing suburbs to view the night sky through an astronomical telescope. ""I was completely shocked by the sky's boundlessness and wanted to know more about the stars,"" she said. In 2009, she began a quest to produce a photographic representation of a solar eclipse from several locations. To realize her objective, she made separate trips to Shanghai, Kenya, the Arctic Ocean, Indonesia and the United States, taking shots of different partial eclipses she eventually combined into a whole. The 28-year-old constantly searches for information related to space and the stars. Her all-consuming interest prompted her to quit her job at an advertising agency in Singapore in 2015 to become a full-time astral photographer. Loneliness and helplessness are her constant companions when she works, but her desire to show people the beauty and power of nature gives her the courage to keep going. ""When I set up my camera and start pressing the shutter, I forget about exhaustion and focus on capturing the night sky to share the images with others,"" she said. Her work means she has to visit sparsely populated mountainous areas on her own at night, while carrying heavy equipment. The first time she visited the North Pole, the slender 28-year-old Beijing native carried a 50-kilogram bag, which was more than she could comfortably manage. ""I always have to fight like a strong man,"" she said. Though conditions are often adverse, Ye enjoys life on the road. In 2013, when she and some friends finished photographing the Northern Lights at a spot outside Reykjavik, capital of Iceland, they discovered that the road they had used on their outward journey had been submerged by the rising tide. As a result, they had to grab the sparse vegetation and haul themselves up to higher ground. Though they all completed the journey safely, Ye was in shock for several days after returning to Beijing. She has faced other dangers, too. During a trip to Namtso Lake, a sacred body of water at high altitude in the Tibet autonomous region, Ye developed chest pains and could hardly breathe. Her companions took her to a hospital, where she was diagnosed with pulmonary edema and had to breathe pure oxygen to recover. ""It was fortunate the doctor was there, otherwise the situation would have been bad,"" she recalled. The incident didn't diminish the thrill she feels when exploring unknown places in search of new experiences. ""Sometimes I feel sad that some people don't see the beauty in my photos, but I will always share my feelings about starry nights with them,"" she said."
1,"HOUSTON - Rosana Ellis banks on the time-honored principles of honesty, hard work and cultivating relationships, and her formula for success is paying off in China. Ellis is chief operating officer at Houston-based PhDsoft, an energy service company that has expanded some of its operations to China. The company's software monitors the structural integrity of oil platforms, bridges and other structures for corrosion and degradation, reducing the risk of accidents and extending the life of clients' assets. PhDsoft's entry into the Chinese market began with casual introductions at the US-China Innovation and Investment Summit (UCIS) in Houston last year. With the opportunity provided by the summit, Ellis went to China for the first time in 2017, which lead to her three other visits later that year. In one year alone, she has traveled to several cities in China and later, the company opened an office in Beijing. ""I'm always excited when I go to China,"" she told Xinhua. ""It's worth it for us to invest the time in developing that market because our company has long-term projections and goals. We are not there for one or two years. We want to establish our PhDsoft brand in China."" Ellis said she has realistic expectations when it comes to entering the Chinese market. That's why she took the time to visit multiple times, soaking in the sights and sounds of Chinese culture and business. ""What happens is that very few companies will go to China one time and establish a connection,"" she said. ""That is very unrealistic. You have to keep in mind that a company has to go to China to start developing a relationship and that's what we did. My first trip was just to observe. The second trip, I could better understand the infrastructure that China has to offer."" It's important to have a strong partner that can help to navigate the cultural divide and is willing to put in the work to forge a successful business relationship, she noted. ""One, you have to be very sensitive and adapt to the needs of the market, and secondly you have to find a good partner,"" Ellis said. ""You have to make sure that you share the pie. You have to give a chance for them to profit with your technology. It creates a win-win situation where everybody's happy and everybody's going to be successful."" But more than just establishing the PhDsoft brand in China, Ellis said she would like to work with her Chinese counterparts to tailor-make a software solution for the Chinese market. ""Personally, I have the goal to expand my business into several countries and continents,"" she said. ""My approach is that you have to understand that your have to fit your product to the culture, and not the other way around. It's not what you sell, it's how what I sell fits the Chinese market."" The more she traveled to China, the more she likes and understands the Asian country. Living in Houston, Ellis sometimes brings family to Chinatown, or cooks Chinese food at home. She said building trust with Chinese partners really needs to understand their culture and value. ""You have to develop the trust,"" Ellis said. ""They have to trust that our company will deliver what we are promising because they're going to invest in our company, and vice versa. They will represent us in our standards in China."""
0,"More than 50 teachers and students from eight music conservatories and art schools from five countries－including the United States, Canada and Kenya－gathered in Beijing on July 14 to perform repertoires such as Franz Liszt's Spanish Rhapsody, Olivier Messiaen's Cluck Old Hen and the premiere of A Song in the Wild by Chinese composer Gong Zihan. The concert kicked off the 2018 ""Understanding China Through Music"" Chinese Music Culture International Summer Institute, a 20-day study program aimed at promoting Chinese music and cultural exchanges among young students and teachers from around the world. Hosted by the Central Conservatory of Music, the program of music study and academic research consists of six sections, including learning how to play traditional Chinese musical instruments and compose original music pieces. Music experts from around the world will hold workshops during the program, including Du Mingxin, a senior professor at the conservatory and Wang Xiaoyan, an associate professor at the National Academy of Chinese Theater Arts. According to Liu Yuening, yangqin (a Chinese dulcimer) player and a professor at the conservatory, who heads the program, over the past four years since the program's establishment, 166 music-majored teachers and students from eight countries have visited China. Dennis Friesen-Carper, a professor at Valparaiso University in the US, where he teaches composition, conducts the school's symphony and produces oratorio and theatrical works, was invited by his longtime friend Liu to the program for the first time this year. At the closing concert on July 29, he will lead foreign students as they play Chinese musical instruments, such as the erhu, a traditional two-stringed fiddle, the lute-like pipa and the sheng, a free-reed woodwind instrument. The piece they will perform, Ode to the South, was composed by Zhu Yi. Liu says that the selection of participants was based on music-majored university students from around the world who are interested in Chinese music. The candidates were recommended by Confucius Institutes worldwide. ""We want to provide young musicians who are interested in spreading Chinese musical culture in their own countries with opportunities to further study Chinese music and become foreign ambassadors for the genre,"" she explains. She adds that, besides teaching students to play traditional Chinese musical instruments, the program also allows students to catch a glimpse of contemporary China. By learning the techniques of playing the instruments, the students will be encouraged to compose their own musical pieces. Liu says that this year, Chinese folk music will form a major part of the summer program and veteran musicians in the field will be invited to give lectures to the students. ""Each piece contains rich Chinese history and culture. Students learn knowledge beyond the music itself. Then, they will have their own understanding about China and compose their own unique sounds,"" Liu says. The Central Conservatory of Music first participated in programs organized by the Confucius Institute in Beijing in 2012. In June that year, the first Music Confucius Institute was established in Copenhagen, as part of a collaboration between the Central Conservatory of Music and the Royal Danish Academy of Music, which aims to actively contribute to the future global development of music by creating synergies between the Western and Chinese musical traditions. In September 2014, the Confucius Institute and the Central Conservatory of Music co-established a music cultural exchange base in Beijing. Megan Hill, a PhD graduate in ethnomusicology at the University of Michigan, participated in the first summer camp at the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing in July of 2014. The camp offered a program of lessons on playing and performing with Chinese instruments, as well as seminars on modern Chinese musical practices－including the guqin (seven-stringed zither), contemporary classical composition and Peking Opera. ""Upon arriving, I didn't know what to expect, but in the ensuing days I learned about ancient Chinese musical instruments and how to ultimately perform Chinese folk songs in front of a large audience,"" recalls Hill. ""This experience was transformative and inspiring. It has ignited within us questions, visions and directions for future research in music creation through a continued relationship with a country we feel we have only just begun to know."" This year, Hill returned to the summer program as a music researcher. Like Hill, Canadian student Matthew Devost from Carleton University, who participated in the program in 2016 and 2017, returned to the capital. ""It was truly a tremendous educational and cultural experience,"" says Devost in Beijing. ""I played musical instruments that I had never played before. I also made lots of new friends with student delegations from universities around the world."""
1,"Of the cities in China, Shanghai is the most fascinating for international tourists due to modern lifestyle facilities such as shopping malls and entertainment venues, according to a report released by Google and market research company Ipsos. Beijing ranked second, thanks to its great number of historic sites, museums and intangible cultural heritages, according to the report on international tourists' recognition and attitudes toward Chinese cities. Dalian, a coastal city in Northeast China with a population of 6.99 million and 773.16 billion yuan ($116.18 billion) in gross regional product, also made the top 10 list because of its beautiful scenery and good investment environment, as reported by Ipsos and Google. The rankings, published on Oct 22, are based on an online impressions survey of 39 Chinese cities from 28,000 tourists representing 19 countries. The survey takers are aged between 18 and 60. Ipsos' Brand Value Creator model was combined with Google search index's behavior data to analyze the survey in order to get an overall impression of these cities for the ranking. Long histories, places of interests, Asian flavor, cost-effective products and delicious food are major factors that affect international tourists' decisions on tourism destinations, the report revealed. Let's take a look at the top 10 most fascinating Chinese cities for international tourists."
1,"Rows of toy claw machines can be seen at shopping malls, cinemas and subway stations in China's big cities. Young people surround the machines, some playing them in groups and others alone. These machines originated from candy dispensers, which appeared in Western countries early in the 20th century and evolved over the decades. They emerged in Japan in the 1980s and were introduced to the Chinese mainland in the 1990s after proving popular in Taiwan. It is estimated that there are 30,000 such machines in shopping malls that opened in China in 2017, with a market value of more than 9 million yuan ($1.3 million). In Japan, the claw machine market size reached 11 billion yuan in 2016, with about 150,000 machines, according to Li Yingshi, an analyst from the Qianzhan Industry Research Institute in Shenzhen, Guangdong province. The items they contain now include sneakers, cakes and snacks. ""Japan's claw machines have become a new form of offline retail,"" she said. In China, the machines have become popular with young people playing them in arcades with their friends. Chen Yantong opened a toy claw machine arcade in downtown Beijing with friends in May last year. ""When you hang out with friends, you want to do something interesting in addition to dining. As many Chinese are used to buying clothes online, shopping is no longer a priority to kill time. So what should they do with that extra time?"" he asked. At the store he helped launch, the peak period is 2 pm to 7 pm. ""Competition is fierce, and similar shops are emerging,"" Chen said. Liang Suya, 28, a photographer from Qingyuan city, Guangdong province, 60 kilometers from Guangzhou, the provincial capital, said: ""Many take it for granted that this is just a simple arcade game, but it requires various skills. I enjoy both the soft toys and the process of grabbing them. ""It's a game that requires careful thinking. You make a judgment after careful observation and consideration, including how the dolls are arranged in the machine. I'm really pleased when I figure out an unexpected way to grab a toy."" Liang became interested in playing the machines when she accidentally grabbed a toy duck that she liked. It took her a while to become adept, and her record is successfully grabbing eight toys in 10 attempts. ""While a mobile game provides virtual prizes, playing claw machines offers rewards in a more substantial form. It feels different,"" she said. Her friend once posted an online video of her grabbing toys, which became a hit, resulting in more than 12 mainstream media outlets interviewing Liang. In January last year, a short video about Liang's story on the sharing website Pear Video attracted more than 30 million hits and 33,000 comments. She attributes the claw machine fad in recent years partially to the popularity of video sites, where players share their successes and skills with others. ""People living in small cities have fewer entertainment choices than those in metropolises. Novelties such as claw machines are appealing to young people, especially those who are on a date and who want to have fun,"" she said. Wen Ji'er, 22, a writer who has published several books, plays the machines up to three times a week, each session lasting more than two hours. She gets to learn about the latest trends and gossip from her fellow players. ""It's like a cafe. We're close to each other and can hear others chatting,"" she said. She once arranged to meet a friend and the friend's partner in a claw machine arcade. Wen believed the couple could get to know each other better by using the machines - for example, whether the young man would be angry if he could not grab a toy. She said playing the machines is a way to relieve her stress. ""I don't like to go to karaoke lounges, pubs or do sports. I like to be by myself and often stay at home in my spare time,"" Wen said. ""I've loved soft toys since I was a child. It (playing toy claw machines) has turned out to be an efficient way for me to deal with anxiety and pressure."" ""You need to be extremely focused to grab a doll by using a claw machine. It's a mixture of excitement and relaxation, and I like the feeling."" Charges for playing the machines in Beijing range from 2 to 5 yuan (30 to 75 cents) for each attempt. Li, the analyst, said they are often installed at shopping malls, cinemas and subway stations - places where there are large numbers of people and high demand. ""Many in the industry in China are individuals operating on a shoestring. Most stuffed toys are rather ordinary, and only a few are authorized by big companies, making them more expensive,"" she said. Chen, who opened a toy claw machine arcade in Beijing, said consumers like dolls they are familiar with, such as those based on emojis. ""It's a good marketing strategy that they can only get the dolls from claw machines. Young people's consumption power should not be neglected,"" he said. Wang Biao, founder and CEO of the company 12 Block Culture, is inspired by the Japanese market and wants to see a successful model in China. ""In Tokyo, some copyright stuffed dolls from popular comics are available only from claw machines. I hope the machines will become a major retail channel for products related to comics and animations in China,"" he said. The Beijing company specializes in creating emojis for social media platforms such as WeChat. In December 2017, it opened LLJ Station claw machine arcades in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. The machines contained the company's stuffed dolls and those authorized by brands in China and overseas. Limited-edition dolls are not for sale and are only available from the machines, for which customers pay 5 yuan per play. The stores are popular among young Chinese and celebrities such as actress Zhao Liying. The company invited a Japanese expert to train its staff members in Beijing. The training included instruction on how to interact with customers. Wang said: ""We do our best to make sure our customers have fun and get the dolls they like. Our algorithm ensures that a customer is able to get two dolls at least by spending 100 yuan. ""It's actually a way of selling dolls. When customers are 'buying' them, they enjoy themselves at the same time. If they fail at certain times, a staff member will help to move a doll to a spot where it is easier to grab. We want to make customers happy. They will not feel happy if they cannot grab a doll."" Liang, the photographer, takes a large shopping bag to carry home the toys she wins. She plays the machines once a week and pays 1 yuan for every attempt. She records her expenses and the number of toys she grabs in a notebook. In the past two years, she has spent more than 40,000 yuan on grabbing over 10,000 toys. She categorizes them carefully and places them in large black plastic bags with written tags, which take up a lot of space at her home. When she moved to a house next door, it took her two weeks to transfer all her toys by throwing the bags over a dividing wall each day. Liang said it is not uncommon for diehard fans like her to own such a large number of soft toys. She said fans enjoy themselves by grabbing the toys, but have to watch the numbers as they accumulate. Some sell their dolls to claw machine owners for a low price or set up stands to sell them on the street. Liang joins benefit activities to sell her dolls and donates the money she gets to those in need. ""Some people don't understand why we spend a fortune on claw machines, and some even think it's squandering money,"" she said. ""In fact, many are willing to spend a lot of money on something they love. Some people may choose to fly to another city to watch a soccer game, or buy a luxury-brand handbag. Playing a claw machine is no different to this."""
0,"Pop-art icon Andy Warhol’s personal photographs from his trip to Beijing and Hong Kong in 1982 are on display in the United Kingdom for the first time at an exhibition in Harrogate, Yorkshire. Thirty-five black and white images are shown at the RedHouse Originals Gallery as part of the Trooping the Colour exhibition and “reveal a highly personal side to the artist”. The photographs taken on a Chinon 35mm point-and-focus compact camera include shots of Warhol’s hotel room, urban landscapes and the iconic Jumbo Kingdom floating restaurant in Hong Kong. Richard McTague, gallery director of RedHouse Originals Gallery,said the pictures will be familiar to today’s Instagram generation. “The photographs are a rare insight into another side of Warhol which people don’t often see,” McTague said, “It’s really Warhol as a tourist and you can tell from the images how captivated Warhol was by China.” Warhol travelled to Hong Kong after an invite from young businessman and entrepreneur Alfred Siu, who had commissioned the late pop-art icon to paint portraits of Prince Charles and Princess Diana for his private members club. Siu then surprised the US artist with a three-day trip to Beijing. Despite being one of the most famous names in the West, Warhol was virtually unknown in China and this allowed him to roam the city largely unrecognized. McTague said the artist’s fascination with China can be seen from his previous works such as his portraits of Mao Zedong in 1972. He noted that Warhol once said he preferred Chinese culture to US culture, saying “I like this better than our culture. It’s simpler. I love all the blue clothes. Everyone wearing blue. I like to wear the same thing every day.” The gallery director added that the photographs are “undeniably Warhol”,with themes of repetition, mass production, advertising and everyday consumption. Warhol took more than 200 photographs on the holiday, “which also left a profound legacy on his work”, and many of his works produced after the trip included Chinese symbology, signage and characters. The exhibition runs until July 7."
0,"An exhibition of Beijing-style   and related products was held in a high school in Shijingshan district on Sept 16. More than 20 intangible cultural heritage enthusiasts ranging from 12 years old to 60 took part in it. It was organized by Great Seed, a global community platform targeting all people interested in intangible cultural heritage to communicate, share, experience and inherit intangible cultural heritage worldwide. Zhang Fenglan, the fifth inheritor of Beijing-style   culture, introduced the exhibited  including blue and white series, ink series and bride gown series, designed and made by Zhang and her team. She said the Beijing-style   with less slit in the sides was more solemn and dignified than the Shanghai-style  . In the cultural creative products zone, Zhang shared some cultural exchange stories about the products. She said she designed a product with the colors of Chinese and Thai national flags for Thailand when she went there to hold an exhibition of Beijing-style   and related products. When asked about the difference between her and her masters, she said that she could innovate   style according to the aesthetic and demand of the masses. After the introduction, Zhang led the participants to the handwork area to experience the process of making a bud by using cloth and cotton. Many participants had handwork experience, some of them were even designers, and some of them had participated in similar activities several times. So the handcraft was relatively easy for them. A dress designer said the reason why she took part in the activity was that she wanted to know more about Chinese clothes, since she always made Western-style clothes. The 12-year-old girl said she was interested in Chinese culture, and wanted to participate more in future."
1,"Yanjiao in Hebei province, 30 kilometers east of Beijing, is home to more than 700,000 people, most of whom work in the capital.  Zhang Yong, born in 1973 in Xi'an in the central province of Shaanxi, used to spend several hours a day commuting by bus and subway.  Since arriving in Beijing in 2008, the high cost of property has forced him to move further and further from the center.  His first apartment in Beijing was near the Liufang Subway Station on the East Second Ring Road, where monthly rents were 2,000 yuan to 3,000 yuan ($290 to $435).  When the rent rose, Zhang moved to Tiantongyuan on the North Sixth Ring Road to save money, but that area quickly became too expensive.  Zhang moved to Yanjiao in 2014 after friends told him that many people who work in Beijing's downtown live there.  ""I love Beijing's culture,"" he said. ""The city's history and culture tell me it's the place I should stay.""  However, the capital's policies don't help people like him, who don't have Beijing hukou, a household registration permit, which means they are not allowed to buy property.  For several years, Zhang worked as an editor at a small publishing company in the Central Business District near the East Third Ring Road.  Despite not traveling during rush hours, his round trip took four hours, so in 2014 he quit his job and became a full-time writer and translator.  ""I made the decision because I was so tired of commuting,"" he said.  Zhang has published several books, some of which have sold well. The money has improved his financial status a little, but not enough to compensate for the soaring rents in and around the capital.  In the past 10 years, Yanjiao's population has risen from about 30,000 to more than 700,000, and the price of real estate has rocketed from 4,000 yuan per square meter to 30,000 yuan.  The main reason is that a growing number of people who are unable to afford apartments in Beijing have chosen to live in Yanjiao, known locally as ""the city of beds"".  ""I don't like to complain, but the cultural atmosphere in Yanjiao is terrible. There isn't a single library in the city,"" he said. ""As someone who writes about culture and history, I'm saddened by that.""  Zhang will continue his writing career and try to save so he can rent an apartment closer to downtown Beijing, the ""real"" Beijing in his opinion.  ""I believe tough environments can create better people. I will work harder to change my life,"" he said."
0,"BEIJING -Beijing had fewer smokers in 2016, the second year of the city's smoking ban, according to a white paper issued Wednesday. The rate of smokers aged 15 years old and above in 2016 was 22.3 percent, 1.1 percentage points lower than 2014, amounting to 200,000 less smokers in the city, according to a report on health conditions in Beijing released by the municipal health and family planning commission. The quitting rate -- which measures the percentage of participants who quit smoking during the survey period -- rose by 1.9 percentage points to 16.8 percent in 2016. Another 15.5 percent of the surveyed smokers said they will quit smoking in the next 12 months, said the report. Beijing, which is home to more than four million adult smokers, rolled out what has been deemed the ""strictest smoking ban in history"" on June 1, 2015, prohibiting smoking in indoor public places, workplaces and public transportation. Gao Xiaojun, spokesperson for the Beijing Health and Family Planning Commission, said at the press conference for the release of the white paper, that health authorities will organize contests to encourage smokers to quit. The white paper, the eighth of its kind, also showed that Beijing's average life expectancy rose by 1.56 years in the last eight years, to reach 82.03. Compared with statistics in 2009, Beijing's maternal mortality rate went down by 25.6 percent and the infant mortality rate dropped by 37.7 percent, according to the white paper. However, chronic diseases, including malignant tumors, heart diseases and cerebrovascular diseases, remain grave challenges for healthcare. Last year, mortality rates of these three types, the most fatal chronic diseases for Beijing residents, all rose from their levels in 2015."
1,"A lack of scenic attractions has not stopped Shaoshan, a small city in Central China's Hunan province, from becoming one of the country's top tourism destinations. It attracted 20 million visitors last year, cementing its status as one of China's 246 5A-level tourism zones. They all came to commemorate Mao Zedong, the founding father of New China, who was born in Shaoshan in 1893. During this year's weeklong National Day holiday, in early October, there were more than 10,000 cars and buses parked every day in the parking lot of the local tourism exchange center, where tourists can transfer to shuttle buses. Almost two weeks after the holiday ended, the center was still full of tourists from all over China. Mao, who spent his childhood in Shaoshan, went on to join and lead the Communist Party of China, and play a central role in the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. Just two years later, his former residence in Shaoshan was opened to the public as a place of interest, sowing the seeds for the growth of Red tourism in the city. Following Mao's death in 1976, red tourism further prospered in the 1980s, with many people wanting to express their condolences and commemorate the late chairman of the CPC Central Committee. ""I am on a business trip to Changsha and I took the opportunity to come here to commemorate Chairman Mao,"" said Cheng Zedong, a 60-year-old Party member from Sichuan province. ""It has long been my dream to visit Chairman Mao's former residence and now the dream has finally come true."" Most of the brochures in tourism agencies in Changsha, Hunan's provincial capital, list Shaoshan as a ""must-see"" tourism destination. Tourism mushroomed after Mao's former residence was given 5A ranking in 2011, and it is now the main pillar supporting the local economy, reaping 6 billion yuan ($865 million) last year. Xiong Juan, a local tour guide, said she can earn about 10,000 yuan a month, more than the average monthly income in Beijing. ""In the past, most of the tourists were seniors or middle-aged people,"" she said. ""In the past decade, we have increasingly had more college students, and even middle school and primary school pupils who come in groups. They hope to learn more about China's history and pay their respects to Chairman Mao."" But the tourism boom did create one major problem: Traffic jams. ""The tourism zone is only 5 kilometers from the nearest highway exit,"" said Yin Zhigang, Party secretary at Shaoshan Tourism Development Group. ""However, around the year 2011, there were so many cars and buses that it took four hours for a car to finish the 5-km route."" That's why the group invested 680 million yuan to build the transfer center, which opened on March 25, 2016. Tourists can now transfer from buses or cars to shuttle buses there, or just walk into the tourism zone. In the three National Day holidays since the launch of the transfer center, traffic has flowed smoothly in Shaoshan's tourism zone. Nowadays it's rare to hear a car horn there. Earlier this year, the city Party committee and the city government issued a three-year plan on further developing red tourism in the zone. According to a leading local tourism official, they hope to stress the role of red education in the sector. By 2020, the number of visitors to Shaoshan each year is expected to exceed 26 million, with 30 percent of local residents making a living from tourism."

From the first WIC, which called for ""An Interconnected World Shared and Governed by All -- Building a Cyberspace Community of Shared Destiny"" with its theme, to this year's ""Creating a Digital World for Mutual Trust and Collective Governance — Towards a Community with a Shared Future in Cyberspace"", the conference is maturing, said Jiang Fei, director of the Center for Intercultural Communication Studies at Beijing Foreign Studies University. Now, the conference is providing a platform to both Chinese and foreign internet companies to exchange experiences and technologies, Jiang said. This year's conference saw more than 1,500 guests from around the world, including government delegates, representatives of international organizations, leading figures of Chinese and foreign internet enterprises and renowned experts and scholars. At the WIC's Light of the Internet Exposition, more than 430 companies and institutions from 25 counties and regions displayed new products and technologies showing endless possibility for improving people's future lives. In addition, the conference unveiled the 15 top recent global scientific and technological achievements, selected from more than 400 leading internet scientific and technological achievements from China, the US, the UK, Germany, France, Russia and Canada, showing the latest technologies in fundamental theory, technological innovation, product process and assembly, business model and cross-category achievements. During the last five years, China has made tremendous progress in the digital economy. As a part of the digital economy, e-commerce is booming in China. On this year's shopping carnival on Nov 11, Alibaba broke its 2014 sales record at 51.7 billion yuan within 36 minutes, and final sales reached a historic high of 213.5 billion yuan. China earned second place on a global digital economy development ranking, which included 150 different countries and regions according to a report jointly released by Alibaba and KPMG. China's digital economy grew to 27.2 trillion yuan last year, up 20.3 percent year-on-year and accounting for 32.9 percent of the country's gross domestic product, according to the Cyberspace Administration of China. Moreover, the country will continue to support development in this regard. On Sept 20, the National Development and Reform Commission signed an agreement with China Development Bank that will invest 100 billion yuan to develop the digital economy over the next five years. The investments will go to projects in big data, internet of things, cloud computing, smart cities and the digital Silk Road."
0,"Having seen the ETU School in Beijing develop from an idea to a facility with 15 full-time teachers and more than 30 students, co-founder Li Yinuo is confident of success and feels ready to take the next step. ""Our goal for 2017 is to expand our school from the current scale of K-Grade 1 (kindergarten to Grade 1) to K-Grade 3, which means a further 80 or 90 students will be recruited in the academic year that will begin in September,"" said the mother of three, a former partner at McKinsey, a global management consultancy, in Beijing and Palo Alto, California.     ETU is located on the campus of the No 80 High School in Beijing's Chaoyang district. Although it has just three classrooms and one teachers' room, the school has attracted attention from parents disillusioned with standardized, test-oriented education in traditional schools. A large number of education specialists seeking innovation in the field have also expressed an interest. When ETU's spring semester started in February, Feng Shu transferred her 6-year-old son to the new project from an international school near Beijing's North Fifth Ring Road. ""Although the facilities and hardware at ETU are not as fancy as those at my son's previous school, I took the decision to bring him here because I believe that rather than producing 'testing machines', ETU tries its best to help children discover themselves and help them to become happy, fulfilled people,"" the Beijing resident said. The idea of establishing the school came to Li early last year when she was trying to move her family back to Beijing from California's Silicon Valley. Like many parents, Li found it hard to find an ideal place for her eldest son. ""Our efforts to find a satisfactory school ended in vain because the public ones available to us were too uniform and reliant on tests, while international schools offer an education that is too Westernized and lacks Chinese roots,"" she said. Li is not alone in her concerns. Yang Dongping, director of the 21st Education Research Institute, a think tank in Beijing, said many parents are concerned and dissatisfied with their children's education. They believe State schools are too reliant on exams, and the excessive workload exerts too much pressure on children. ""But for a long time, parents could only face this education system with an attitude of 'tolerate, criticize and go back to tolerating',"" he said, adding that many parents choose to break the cycle by sending their children to study overseas. That dissatisfaction may be one of the driving forces behind a recent exodus of children. At the end of 2015, almost 35,000 Chinese children were studying at K-12 level in the US, according to a report published last year by Eol, a leading Chinese education portal. In 2010, the number was about 9,000. Li was reluctant to follow that path because she didn't want her son to grow up as a ""foreigner"", knowing little about Chinese language and culture. She said she had seen many young Chinese in the US ""suffering from a vague national identity and failing to integrate into either community"". In her opinion, the ideal education should be tailored to inspire, motivate and protect children's intrinsic desire to learn, tap their potential, discover their strengths and help them become the person they want to be. It also should help them grow up as globally competent citizens, or as she described it, ""truly Chinese, truly global"". According to Yang, rather than complaining and leaving, many parents, particularly well-educated couples in big cities, are now trying a ""third way"" by conducting educational experiments and exploring diverse forms of learning, such as homeschooling, which is discouraged by the education authorities.,Li was not the first parent in China to decide to establish a school, but for people with no track record of running such a venture, setting one up is easier said than done. From the beginning, she kept asking herself where she would find the key elements, such as funding, a venue, the requisite permits and a source of teachers and students. ""We were really lucky, because we received so much assistance and support that all the difficulties were overcome one by one,"" she said. Having reached an agreement to cooperate with the Beijing No 80 High School, Li and her co-founders opened ETU just 170 days after the idea first occurred to her. The initial plan was to recruit 24 students for the first semester, but ETU received more than 150 applications. Thirty-one students were finally accepted. Despite their different educations and professional backgrounds, the first batch of ETU parents shared one thing in common－a desire to find an education that would help their children achieve their personal goals. Moreover, they want the school to not only cultivate globally competent talents, but also instill a true appreciation of Chinese culture, especially at a time when East and West are becoming increasingly intertwined. In addition to selecting students, Li said the parents' trust and belief in ETU and the personalized education the school tries to offer counted greatly during the admission process, especially during the first year. ""After all, in China's current position, and in many people's eyes, sending one's children to a school like ETU may seem like a big risk,"" she conceded.,Like their peers at public schools, ETU students learn Chinese, math and English using the Ministry of Education's textbooks and curriculum. Unlike their State-educated peers, though, the students at ETU are taught in an innovative and personalized way that puts them at the center of the class, with their voices being heard and their needs being met by the teachers, according to Guo Xiaoyue, ETU's principal. For example, when the students are learning Chinese characters, instead of memorizing and writing them out dozens of times, they are encouraged to think about the symbols and discuss why they should learn them. They are also encouraged to note the characters they see in their daily lives, study them on their own and then teach them to their classmates. In addition, ETU also includes STEAM－the collective name for science, technology, engineering, arts and math－in project-based learning, or PBL, a type of class that requires teachers across all subjects to design the content and teach the class together, rather than working alone. The teachers are not expected to simply deliver knowledge, but also to answer the students' questions and guide them to think, research and make things on their own. ""Our teachers spend a lot of time working together every day in the belief that PBL is a very effective way for children to learn. It can inspire their natural instincts to learn and explore the unknown,"" said Guo, who has run her own innovative education program in Beijing since 2013. Xiang Rong, a teacher of Chinese at ETU, defined a good education as ""being able to fill children's eyes with the light of curiosity"". That's why, having taught at different schools in China for more than two decades, from primary level all the way up to college, she decided to transfer to the new school. ""Right here in ETU's classrooms, I feel we are doing things correctly. We are not fast, but every step we take is firm and solid,"" she said. Guo has decided to enroll her 6-year-old daughter at ETU in September: ""She liked the school at first sight."""
1,"Achieving accolades and pioneering new initiatives are nothing new for Sany Heavy Industry Co, one of China's shining successes both at home and abroad. So much so, that four decades after China launched reform and opening up, the machinery equipment maker looks set to add another feather to its cap with record-breaking growth in revenue and net profit for 2018. Indications that the Changsha, Hunan province-based company was on the threshold of a huge success came after it said that its net profit for the first six months of this year was 3.389 billion yuan ($494 million), an increase of 192.09 percent over the same period a year ago. What was even more surprising was that the company had already achieved 161 percent of the total net profit it earned for 2017 during the first six months. ""The country's reform and opening-up strategy has brought vitality to Sany,"" said Xiang Wenbo, president of Sany.""2018 marks the country's 40th anniversary in initiating reform and opening-up and it has been the best year so far for Sany, as we expected profit, cash flow and revenue to scale new peaks."" Xiang said Sany's success has largely been due to its ability to convert the opportunities arising from China's reform push into tangible growth over the years. ""The five years after the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China held in 2012 was a period of rocketing growth for the country's construction and machinery industry. During that period Sany not only upgraded its entire gamut of operations, but also shifted to a new phase of development."" Explaining further, Xiang said that in 2012, China's machinery industry was facing a winter of sorts as several real estate and infrastructure projects had been called off for economic reasons. ""We decided to change tack and focus on the overseas markets, instead,"" he said. ""That was surprising for many as until then, more than 90 percent of our revenue came from the domestic market. We decided that we had to accelerate our progress in global markets to get out of the rut,"" Xiang said. In 2012, Sany acquired German machinery maker Putzmeister, for 360 million euros ($440 million), the biggest Chinese acquisition at the time. The real impetus for Sany came from the Belt and Road Initiative, as the trade plan was in sync with its growth blueprint. ""About 70 percent of our overseas revenue is generated in economies along the BRI,"" Xiang said. ""The initiative has provided a tremendous opportunity for raising our international production capacity and cooperation,"" he said. Currently the company has three industrial clusters in Changsha, Beijing and the Yangtze River Delta, three industrial parks in Shenyang, the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region and Zhuhai, and four research, development and production centers in India, the United States, Germany and Brazil. Qi Jun, president of the China Construction Machinery Association, said the overseas efforts of Chinese companies have played a big role in global industrial recovery. Sany was ranked eighth in a recent global ranking of the top 50 construction equipment manufacturers in the world. ""Of the 12 companies that saw a rise in sales of more than 40 percent, nine were Chinese. The combined sales of the 12 Chinese construction machinery manufacturers on the list reached $24.78 billion,"" said Qi. He added that infrastructure projects, aimed at boosting connectivity and unveiled as part of the BRI, have directly stimulated the country's machinery equipment industry. ""There are at least $800 billion worth of infrastructure projects in the next decade in the economies along the Belt and Road Initiative,"" he said, adding that the country's opening up strategy has given Chinese machinery makers the impetus for long-term and sustainable growth."
0,"Former Japanese prime minister Yasuo Fukuda has spoken highly of President Xi Jinping's proposal for building a community with a shared future for mankind and creating a better world. Xi, general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, expounded on the idea while delivering a report at the 19th National Congress of the CPC in Beijing in October. Fukuda, who was prime minister from 2007-08, told participants at the third round of the annual dialogue between Chinese and Japanese business leaders and former high-ranking officials in Tokyo last month that Xi's road map for China's development deserves intensive study in Japan. ""Above all, China is committed to working together with the rest of the world to build a brand new world order based on respect, fairness and reciprocity,"" said Fukuda, who made a secret visit to Beijing in 2014 as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's special envoy to mend ties with China. Liu Di, professor of political science at Tokyo-based Kyorin University, said the proposal to build a community with a shared future for mankind is of great significance to China and the world. ""There are many communities in the world's history. But all of them have a problem: coordination within each of the communities and among different communities,"" Liu said. In the past, there were people who came up with the idea of building universal harmony in the world, but their ideals ended up being wild fancies, the professor said, thanks to outmoded technology and productivity. Xi's proposal has come at the advent of an unprecedented technological revolution, which is transforming people's existence and way of life, bringing positive factors and dangers alike. ""On the one hand, humans have never needed solidarity and close cooperation like today,"" Liu said. ""On the other, we can't take it for granted that all is right with the world because of the grand proposal."" Because crises have put the world to a severe test, the international community needs to be farsighted and have the courage to break the barriers caused by racial, cultural and ideological differences and conflicts, the professor said. He suggested that all countries, civic groups and individuals change their mindset and behavior in order to coordinate and safeguard human civilizations. Noriyoshi Ehara, chief economist at the Institute of International Trade and Investment in Tokyo, said China's proposal for building a community with a shared future for mankind is in keeping with a world trend."
0,"The Chinese Academy of Sciences launched its second summer internship program for Hong Kong undergraduates in Beijing on Monday, allowing students from the special administrative region to learn about traditional Chinese culture and scientific development and build relations with peers from the Chinese mainland. For the following six weeks, 49 students from top Hong Kong universities will study artificial intelligence, robotics and autonomous driving, physics, mathematics and biosciences in six institutions under the academy, China's highest academic institute. The number of participants and host institutions has doubled compared with that of last summer. The program is organized by Hong Kong's Home Affairs Bureau, the academy's Bureau of Science Communication and the Intelligence Science and Technology Popularization Alliance. ""The program is a great opportunity for Hong Kong undergraduates to learn about the nation's latest scientific developments and improve their professional knowledge and skills,"" said Li Shushen, the academy's vice-president, at the program's opening on Monday. ""We welcome more Hong Kong students to come study at the academy and contribute to the prosperity of the nation,"" he said. In recent years, the mainland and Hong Kong have expanded cultural and career-oriented exchange programs as a means of providing education and employment opportunities for the younger generation, as well as facilitating social integration and joint progress. Last year, Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, chief executive of the Hong Kong SAR, pledged to enhance scientific exchanges and collaboration with the Chinese mainland after President Xi Jinping said the central authorities would support Hong Kong becoming an international center for innovative science and technology. Jack Chan Jick-chi, Hong Kong's undersecretary for home affairs, said the internship program can expand Hong Kong students' horizons, and he hopes participants will share their experiences with others back home. Xu Bo, director of the academy's Institute of Automation, said his institute is happy to host another group of Hong Kong students. ""AI is now changing the world, and our institute is one of the best in the country to study AI technologies,"" Xu said. He added that the institute appreciates Hong Kong students' curiosity and aspirations of using new technologies to benefit society. Zhang Dongmei, secretary-general of the Intelligence Science and Technology Popularization Alliance, said she hopes Hong Kong students can learn necessary scientific methodologies and foster a spirit of exploration to be successful in their future careers. Shuen Chi-yeung, a junior at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, said he would love to learn about neural networks and AI applications in biology during his time in Beijing. ""Hong Kong and the mainland share many common issues, such as traffic congestion and aging populations, that can be solved via advances in new technologies,"" Shuen said. ""Although Hong Kong has devoted many resources to scientific research, it is still incomparable to the mainland, so cooperation and exchanges are key."""

Country: United States ""China remains Honeywell's largest market outside the United States,"" said Shen Bin, president of Honeywell China. The operation revenue of Honeywell in China jumped six times from 2004 to 2017. The company located its Asia-Pacific headquarters in Shanghai, and has built 26 plants in the country with more than 2,600 R&D employees. Local innovation, R&D and production contributed to 30 percent of Honeywell's revenue in China. China has become one of the largest R&D centers for Siemens around the globe, as the company has 21 innovation centers and 4,500 employees in the country. Siemens built the first digital intelligent production line for Chinese beverage brand Wahaha; and shortened quality control inspection time by 25 percent for dairy producer Mengniu.

0,"The 2017 Visiting Program for Young Sinologists kicks off at the National Library of China in Beijing on Monday.  The project, which enables international academics to immerse themselves into Chinese cultural dialogue, gives participants a better chance to capture the ethos of Chinese civilization. The program, which began Sunday and runs to Sept 30, offers 27 intellectuals from 26 countries lectures, the opportunity to finish research at language and culture institutions, and a field tour of traditional Chinese culture in East China's Jiangxi province. The participants all possess strong personal ties to China. Most have studied, worked or lived in major Chinese cities.  ""I read Pearl S. Buck's   in high school and became fascinated with Chinese culture ever since,"" said Ana Jovanovic, a docent at the University of Belgrade in Serbia. ""I came to Beijing in 2003 and fell in love with China,"" Maria Elvira Rios Penafiel, researcher of the Ministry of Education of Chile, said.

The town is due to open in the capital's northeast Shunyi district in 2019, offering thrill-seekers a chance to try out off-road racing. BAIC is currently expanding its product mix by introducing off-road vehicles, aiming to meet increasing demand for extreme sports experiences. Last year, BAIC's off-road vehicle sales doubled year-on-year. ""In the future, competitiveness will depend on culture,"" said Xu Heyi, chairman of the group. He said that after years of strong results, culture will now empower the group to achieve further growth, as BAIC will strengthen experience-based marketing for off-road vehicles, vigorously promote off-road culture and heighten brand loyalty. BAIC's dealers have already built more than 20 off-road bases, laying a solid foundation for popularizing off-road culture, according to the company. Data from Intelligence Research Group shows that the average age of automobile consumers in China is becoming increasingly younger. The average customer today prefers exciting and high-performance driving experiences that incorporate scenery and adventure. More buyers are choosing versatile vehicles with off-road capabilities over sedans. According to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, passenger car sales reached 24.72 million vehicles in 2017, up 1.4 percent on the previous year. In the same period, SUV sales climbed 13.3 percent while sedan sales dropped 2.5 percent. McKinsey and Co, a global management consulting firm, predicted that by 2022, half of the cars sold in China will be SUVs. ""While the recent resurgence in sales represents one of the most dramatic shifts in China's automotive market, a variety of other factors are at play that will drive even more profound changes in the industry over the coming years. Perhaps the biggest of these changes involves the transformation taking place among car buyers,"" said Wouter Baan, associate partner in McKinsey's Beijing office. ""Increasingly savvy and sophisticated, today's auto buyers demand more digital features and are growing increasingly unhappy with the traditional dealer experience. The emergence of this more demanding segment of car buyers is reshaping the car industry,"" Baan said. To avoid fierce price wars in the market segment, domestic automobile players are launching more premium vehicles to improve their margins. However, it remains too early to tell whether such strategies will convince car consumers to buy their products in a segment filled with well-established international brands, said the McKinsey report."
1,"Carving your own niche in a thriving industry in a foreign country is no mean feat, especially if it is China's booming livestreaming industry. China is home to prominent online celebrities such as Angelababy, while millions of Chinese people broadcast their daily lives in real time, making small fortunes in the process. But Greek twin sisters Marianna and Sofia Erotokritou have slowly been making a name for themselves in this online world, acting as virtual ambassadors for their home in their adopted country. Like most others who break into the industry, Marianna and Sofia stumbled upon livestreaming by chance. When they first decided to upload videos of themselves, little did they realize that they would find such a receptive audience in China. In the beginning, the sisters uploaded short videos in Mandarin about popular spots in Beijing they visited－such as Nanluogu Xiang and Sanlitun－introducing the food they tasted. To their surprise, they received hundreds of positive comments online and more livestreaming requests from their fans. Since then, their regular broadcasts on NetEase platforms are eagerly lapped up by audiences keen to understand the finer nuances that link the two countries. Be it food, fashion, theater, or even aspects that cover their daily lives, the sisters have managed to be a cultural connection point in their own unique way. They have become known for livestreaming themselves strolling among white houses with blue domes on the island of Santorini, surrounded by the Aegean Sea; tasting traditional stuffed Greek pies at Monastiaraki Square in the capital Athens; and riding a tandem bicycle on the ancient city walls of Xi'an in Northwest China's Shaanxi province. Although the attention they receive from Chinese netizens is positive, the sisters maintain that none of it would have been possible but for their excellent command of Mandarin and their in-depth knowledge about Chinese culture. Marianna and Sofia said that they did not realize their father's numerous stories about China from his numerous business trips would one day be their ticket to fame and fortune. ""China seems to be a very mysterious country, just like Greece,"" said Sofia, the younger sister by one minute. ""We wanted to explore and feel this historical country in person, so we decided to study in Beijing."" Marianna and Sofia joined Beijing's University of International Business and Economics in 2014, majoring in international economics and trade. Although they are still in their fourth year of studies, they have already started to earn their own money thanks to social media. The two do not earn much through livestreaming, as their main purpose is to promote both countries' cultures. During each of their live shows, the two gain rewards and encouragement from netizens, helping them to explore and travel more widely both in China and Greece. Meanwhile, they are also being noticed by both Chinese and Greek merchants, who invite them to try their food and promote their products. Last year, Marianna and Sofia were invited to introduce Greek culture on Kai Jiang La, an educational talk show aimed at younger viewers of CCTV-1, China Central Television's flagship channel. The experience inspired them to teach Greek on their own show. ""Our business is not only about the financial benefit, but mainly to provide a platform for Sino-Greek communication and understanding under the Belt and Road Initiative,"" said Marianna. ""We hope our videos can encourage more people from China and Greece to become closer."""
1,"More than 2.6 billion yuan ($400 million) was spent on dining, entertainment and shopping in Beijing during the New Year holiday, with the ""white economy"" becoming a new growth point. With excitement rising over the city's hosting of the 2022 Winter Olympic Games, many used the three-day break to try out the ski slopes in the capital's outskirts. ""We love sports, and the upcoming Winter Olympics has really raised our interests in winter sports,"" said Li Lei, who spent the holiday with three friends at a ski resort in suburban Miyun county. He said the equipment and services at the resort were advanced, while the group stayed at a cozy hotel with good restaurants. To meet the growing demand for winter sports, the Beijing Skiing Association, resorts and sports goods companies organized ice and snow festivals to promote their services and products over the holidays. Established ski resorts in the capital's Huairou, Pinggu and Miyun counties were full of people day and night, while many parks, including around the Bird's Nest and Chaoyang Park, held skating or skiing activities to entertain the public. The combined revenue of 60 key commercial services companies reached 2.67 billion yuan between Saturday and Monday, representing growth of 10.5 percent compared with the same period last year, according to the Beijing Commerce Commission. The commission did not provide a detailed breakdown of the revenue from winter sports - the so-called white economy - but said it had become a new consumption hot spot. According to a report from the China Tourism Academy, the domestic winter travel market over 2016 and 2017 was worth 270 billion yuan. This is forecast to expand to 670 billion yuan in 2021 and 2022. ""The output value of the winter travel and related industries will reach 2.88 trillion yuan"" by the time Beijing and co-host Zhangjiakou in Hebei province welcome the Winter Olympics, the report added. Li Xiaoge, chairman of the Beijing Skiing Association, said the existing ski resorts and winter travel destinations across China cannot meet the booming demand, which means more will likely be built in the coming years. Beijing has 22 indoor and outdoor ski slopes, according to the association. Traditional retail companies in the capital saw their New Year's sales grow more than 20 percent compared with last year, according to data from the commerce commission."
0,"Caves, beekeepers and stone villages are among the surprising discoveries of a driving trip from the capital through Hebei province, Erik Nilsson discovers. There were two donkeys outside the restaurant. One was printed on a sign above the street where the other - a real donkey - was being slaughtered. Talk about fresh food. And the meat was, indeed, delicious. So, too, was the wild white-flower cliff honey we bought from vendors along the roadside on our road trip from Beijing through Hebei province. I'd never seen solid honey before. The crystals looked like yellow rock sugar and tasted like marshmallows but with a hint of floral fragrance. Beekeepers were also selling liquid varieties harvested from hives in crates along the roadside. Our friend got stung when a bee got stuck in his hair during his purchase. We bought the hunks of honey at Cuandixia village, a Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) stone settlement that tumbles down a crag in suburban Beijing. The ancient trade and military post is also known for an abundance of murals printed with Maoist slogans. Villagers visit the settlement's Grand Temple to pray for piety, the Niangniang Temple to pray for pregnancy and the Dragon King Temple to pray for rain and worship the god of heaven.,We later headed to rural Baoding, Hebei province, to spelunk through the 1.8-kilometer-long Yugudong, or Fish Bone Cave. The karst cavern bored into the juncture of the Taihang and Yanshan mountain ranges in Laishui county hosts incredible formations sired throughout the eons following the Cambrian period. The cave contains ""moon milk"" pools, ""rock waterfalls"", ""stone curtains"", ""rock flowers"" and ""goose tubes"" in addition to stalactites that dribble from the ceiling and stalagmites that jut from the ground. These formations crowd chambers with such names as A Superb Collection of Beautiful Things Hall, Dragon's Den and Five Sons Offering Birthday Felicitations. We exited the cave halfway up the mountain and shot down the steep slope on toboggans. ""I wanted to scream but was too scared,"" my daughter told me at the bottom. She wanted to do it again. We instead boarded a speedboat on the lake at the foot of the peak. The vessel tilted and sprayed rooster tails of water as we did doughnuts around an islet. We'd tried to visit Yishui Lake along the way but had to leave because the place was packed to capacity and had stopped selling tickets. So, we instead explored a wild river along a road through a nearby forest. We enjoyed a picnic and staged an Easter Egg hunt for our kids. Our son caught tadpoles and bugs, and tossed stones in the water, while we watched waterfowl torpedo beneath the ripples and re-emerge clutching fish in their beaks. Singing birds and chirping frogs were accompanied by the sounds of leaves applauding in the breeze.,No tickets. No parking. No crowds. We agreed we likely enjoyed the isolated waterway more than we would have appreciated the built-up tourist destination. We similarly weren't able to visit the Grassland on the Air - so named because of its high elevation - near Hebei's border with Shanxi province. Authorities had declared a high fire risk due to dry weather and set up road blocks to keep outsiders from entering the site. So, we found a wild patch of prairie just outside the tourism attraction, where our children played with grazing piglets that trotted along the desolate landscape. Again, we perhaps had just as much fun as we would have if we'd paid for admission to the adjacent attraction. We later stopped at a quarry for another picnic. The kids scuttled over a large sand pile and watched the diggers, dump trucks and sifters reconfigure the terrain. Throughout our trip, we ate and slept in farmers' houses and stopped along such spots as small mountaintop temples. At one remote shrine, I was marveling that nobody had stolen the offerings, including cash, left for statues of deities when my 3-year-old tried to eat some of the pears. ""No, Sagan! That food belongs to the gods,"" I told him. We bought him fruit meant for mortals afterward. At one point, we decided to drive over 60 kilometers along a single-lane road connecting several villages in the forests - for no reason, other than to do it. It truly was a case in which the adventures were more about the journey than the destination, considering we didn't even know where the motorway led. Indeed, the trip showed us that Hebei has many lesser-known locations worth exploring that are far from the beaten path but still along the open road."

By inviting 28 award-winning authors from the European Union and China, the festival sets out to promote cultural exchanges between the two sides and give insights into the lives, works, and unique character of their literary traditions. As an integral part of the two-year-long Experience Europe initiative, a series of literary events will be held in Beijing and Chengdu, capital of Southwest Chuina's Sichuan province. Topics, such as literary ways and means, the writers' lives, diversity of writing forms and literary media in the digital age will be discussed among writers and between writers and book readers. The event provides Chinese audiences with a valuable opportunity to witness how diversity plays into story formation and how the interplay of two cultures produces even more richness and complexity in these authors' works. ""The eight prominent European authors selected to represent their countries at this historic event hail from Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, and Slovakia, and we are proud to be joined by some wonderful writers from all across China. In both Beijing and Chengdu, the festival will involve a series of literary events and discussions where authors can exchange ideas, engage with readers and audiences, and celebrate the diversity of European and Chinese culture,"" EU Ambassador to China Hans Dietmar Schweisgut said.   ""Over the coming 18 months, the second and third EU-China Literary Festival will be arranged with a view to welcoming authors from all the EU member states to China, and to connecting with Chinese authors and audiences in different regions of the country,"" the ambassador added. Lu Min, winner of prestigious awards, including the Zhuang Zhongwen Literary Award and the People's Literary Award, and one of the Chinese authors participating in the festival's activities, shared her thoughts. ""Writing to me, it requires more than solitude, yet writers need to blend and to be stirred. I am very much looking forward to meeting the eight authors visiting from Europe, for in the face of a complex and fascinating world we have a common view finder: literature,"" Lu said. Belgian writer and actress Isabelle Wery, who is the winner of the European Union Prize for Literature, said, ""Europe and China have two different literary worlds. If authors can come together to discuss not just how to write books, but how books are going to be written in the future, I am really excited to hear what the Chinese writers have to say."" ""I like travelling in my life. During each journey, I can find new inspirations for my life and my work, and I like to share my experience in the journey with Chinese readers in the coming events,"" Wery added.   Other literary talents at the event included A Yi, a Chinese short story author and winner of People's Literature Short Stories' award for   and Paolo Colagrande, author of  one of the top 10 Italian novels at the Festival du Roman of Cuneo-Chambery. A special highlight is an online contest launched by the European Union Delegation prior to the Festival, where curious readers submitted their questions to the authors. With Lu Min as judge, two winners were selected to attend the launch reception of the 2017 Literary Festival and to chat with their favorite authors in person."
1,"Of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions, 10 maintained double-digit growth in consumption last year, 21st Century Business Herald reported. Southwest China's Tibet autonomous region, with a growth rate of 14.2 percent, took the top spot nationwide, followed by East China's Anhui province (11.6 percent).Sichuan province and Yunnan province tied for third place with 11.1 percent. Last year, a total of 13 regions saw their consumption growth below 8 percent. Some developed regions such as Beijing and Tianjin saw growth at 2.7 percent and 1.7 percent respectively, placing them at the bottom two of the chart of 31 provincial-level regions. Meanwhile, Northeast China's Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning provinces, as well as Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur and Ningxia Hui autonomous regions, also saw slower growth rate of retail sales of consumer goods. However, slower growth doesn't mean consumption was downgrading, the newspaper said. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, last year, total retail sales of consumer goods rose 9 percent from a year ago to 38 trillion yuan ($5.66 trillion). Consumption played an increasingly bigger role in the economy, contributing 76.2 percent of GDP growth, up significantly by 18.6 percentage points from a year ago. Ning Jizhe, head of the National Bureau of Statistics, earlier said that China's consumption structure is upgrading overall as people's income rise. Consumption is expected to contribute to 65 percent of China's economic growth in 2019 and remain the largest contributor, said Wang Bin, deputy director of the Department of Market Operation and Consumption Promotion at the Ministry of Commerce, at a recent meeting. The newspaper said residents in Beijing and Tianjin, with higher income level, have lower demand for durable consumer goods such as food. That reflects consumption structure is changing, as they are spending more money on goods and services other than food. Engel coefficient, a measure of food expenditure as a proportion of total household spending, fell to 28.4 percent last year, down 0.9 percentage point from the previous year. People are becoming more rational when buying, said Yang Xiaoyan, a professor at Guangdong University of Foreign Studies, adding that it shows consumption is maturing rather than downgrading."
0,"Mainland residents who need a passport or a permit for travel to Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, will be able to complete the application process at any entry and exit office nationwide starting on Sept 1, the State Immigration Administration said on Tuesday. Currently, individual applicants living somewhere other than the place of residence indicated in their hukou, or residence permit, often found it necessary to return to their hometown to get a passport or travel document, because a person in another province requires proof of address, employment, study and kinship, Qu Yunhai, deputy director of the State Immigration Administration, said during a news conference in Beijing. After the new measures take effect, applicants will not need to travel back and forth to get travel documents, Qu said. People in tour groups traveling to Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan can also complete travel document applications at all entry and exit offices nationwide, he said, adding that all applications will be completed within seven working days. Around 2.7 million people will benefit from the simplified procedures annually, saving them a total of 3 billion yuan ($439 million). The new requirement will also save 7.8 million travelers to Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan 9 billion yuan annually, according to the administration. The country adopted a one-visit-only policy in May to streamline travel document applications nationally. Applicants for passports, as well as for permits to travel to and from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, can be completed with one visit to the exit-entry administration office. The administration has simplified procedures to allow applicants to submit photos, fingerprints and application materials, and will conduct face-to-face interviews and take payment all at the same time. Applicants are encouraged to make reservations via the internet to speed up the process. Exit-entry administration offices issued 133 million travel documents during the first half of 2018, up 18.3 percent from a year earlier. The total number of inbound and outbound travelers in China rose by 7.7 percent to 310 million during the same period, according to statistics. Shi Congqiang, who has worked in Beijing for two years, said he welcomes the simplified regulations. Shi, who is from Shandong province, wants to take a vacation to Southeast Asia during the National Day holiday. ""With the new measures, I can get a passport in Beijing and do not have to return to my hometown,"" he said. ""It will save me two days and around 1,000 yuan in travel expenses."""
0,"Volunteer service in Beijing was worth an estimated 11.7 billion yuan ($1.76 billion) in 2015, representing 0.51 percent of the capital's GDP, a report by Beijing Normal University has found. About 4 million people are registered as volunteers in Beijing, each working an average of 84.3 hours a year, according to the Value of Volunteer Service 2017 report released on Friday. The university conducted an online poll of volunteers in six cities, including Beijing, Guiyang and Xiamen, and an offline poll in Beijing and Chengdu between July and September. Some 2,296 volunteers were surveyed in Beijing alone. The report showed only 18 percent of registered volunteers are active, meaning they have provided volunteer services in the past year, suggesting more measures are needed to encourage volunteering. ""China has seen rapid growth in volunteer service due to support from governments, social organizations and private companies, and it could make a significant contribution to China's pursuit of sustainable development,"" said Guan Chenghua, a professor at the university. He added that it is important to evaluate volunteering in China and share experiences with foreign partners. The report was released at a panel discussion held by the United Nations Volunteers' headquarters and China office in cooperation with the China International Center for Economic and Technical Exchanges, Beijing Normal University and the Beijing Volunteer Service Federation. It was announced that a volunteer alliance had been launched for the Belt and Road Initiative, and a group had been formed to unite organizations to present data and evidence about China at a global technical meeting on volunteering in 2020. ""I hope we can work together beyond this event to strengthen cooperation and share responsibilities,"" said Manon Bernier, the UN Volunteers manager for the Asia-Pacific region. ""In doing so, I hope we can consider how UNV can help volunteer partners in this process to facilitate the implementation of the Belt and Road Initiative and the UN sustainable development goals."""

The exhibit, titled features 364 ancient ceramics pieces, 316 pieces and sets of ancient ceramic replicas, and modern household porcelains, art ceramics and high-tech ceramics.  The exhibition, split into five different categories, consists of one part showcasing ancient porcelain specimens, which span from the Eastern Han Dynasty (AD 25-220) to modern times. This part of the exhibit also displays the largest amount of porcelain specimens so far in China. Several academic lectures and art exchange activities will also be scheduled throughout the exhibition, which will run until the end of August.  Wang Guangyao, a researcher from the Beijing Palace Museum, deliveredthe firstlecturetitled ""Porcelains used the royal court along the history"" on the opening day. Several influential ceramic artisans, with excellent craftsmanship from Jingdezhen, were also invited to the opening ceremony of the exhibit. Theartisans were able to showcase their techniques and work at the event, which enabled visitors to discover more about Jingdezhen ceramic making.,  Liu Xiaofeng, deputy head of the CPPCC, Huang Zhixian and Liu Jiaqiang, two deputy secretary generals of the CPPCC, and experts in culture and history fields attended the opening ceremony. Wu Juan, secretary general of the Jingdezhen municipal Party committee, said the fine-selected porcelains at the exhibition were a record ofJingdezhen's past and present achievements, which he thought has become a full display of Jingdezhen's ceramic culture in Beijing.  ""Jingdezhen is actively involved in the Belt and Road Initiative, and strives to present splendid Chinese culture, while delivering China's voice in the communication with the world,"" he said. Jingdezhen, a city in South China's Jiangxi province, is widely known as China's ""porcelain capital"". The city has more than 1,700 years of history in porcelain-making, and used to produce porcelain for the royal court in ancient times. The unique clay resources in Jingdezhen, along with its time-honored craftsmanship, have made it a preferred resort for porcelain lovers and tourists alike."
1,"High-speed rail passengers who were forced to stand for up to three hours after a malfunction affected services in northern China over the National Day holiday have received an apology from the rail operator, but no refund. Second-class ticket holders had to crowd the aisles and corridors on two services from Handan to Qinhuangdao, in Hebei province, and one from Handan to Tianjin last week due to the number of cars being halved. Rail operator China Railway Beijing Group, which covers the region including Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei, said in a statement on Sina Weibo on Saturday that the situation was caused by malfunctions in two engines on Thursday, which meant the number of cars had to be cut from 16 to eight on three services. The information was broadcast to passengers ahead of time at the stations, allowing them to reschedule, according to the statement. However, angry passengers who took the affected services have used social media to complain about not being offered refunds. A man surnamed Liu told China Central Television he traveled on the G6288 Handan-Tianjin service on Friday. He boarded at Shijiazhuang, the capital of Hebei, and his ticket was for car 13, but when the train arrived at the station it had only the first eight cars. ""The train crew said … that we needed to hurry since the train was about to leave. We had to make it back to Tianjin, so we got on the train,"" he said. ""The carriages were crowded with passengers from the back eight cars, including the elderly, children and pregnant women. They had no seats and had to find their own way,"" he said, adding that the journey lasted about two hours. ""There was no explanation given to us during the whole ride, or after we got off in Tianjin."" Liu told CCTV that only first-class and business-class passengers were offered refunds, as the price for a second-class seat is the same as for a standing ticket. A passenger on the G6284 Handan-Qinhuangdao service on Thursday wrote on Sina Weibo about a similar experience. The woman, using the name Sageram, said she also boarded in Shijiazhuang and had to stand for several hours because her ticket had been for car 14. Zhao Sanping, director of Beijing Guangheng Law Firm, said more consideration is needed in meeting the demand for high-speed rail services. ""A ticket is a contract with the railway department… but such situations are sometimes unavoidable,"" he said. ""The railway department should send notice in advance and later make explanations to passengers."""

Zhang, who wowed the world with his opening and closing ceremonies for the Beijing Olympics in 2008, has been appointed to direct China's contribution to the pageantry next year.  ""We will show the world the passion of Chinese people and offer the greatest welcome to all the guests,"" Zhang said.  Beijing has been named host city for the 2022 Winter Olympics, beating Kazakhstan's Almaty in a two-horse race and becoming the first city to host both the summer and winter events.  At the closing ceremony in 2018, China will take possession of the Olympic flag, as Beijing and neighboring Zhangjiakou in Hebei province will co-host the 2022 Games. The host city generally presents a preview of the next Games to be held four years later.  Apart from completing the flag-taking ceremony, Zhang said the performance will convey two messages: ""Welcome to Zhangjiakou"" and ""See you in 2022 in Beijing"".  ""We will stick to Chinese culture, with a combination of different cultural elements,"" Zhang said. ""Culture is always the toughest part.""  A netizen named Yansuochonglou complimented the video interview with Zhang, saying: ""Zhang impressed the world at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. We are looking forward to the amazement he will bring to Pyeongchang.""  Sha Xiaolan, the stage design team leader, said the 2022 Winter Olympics will provide a good opportunity for foreigners to experience Chinese Lunar New Year and people's passion for family gatherings.  ""To show the world what they've never seen or heard before will be our top mission during the eight-minute performance,"" Sha said.  Directed by Zhang, a TV reality show featuring winter sports in China - The King of Kanone - premiered earlier this year, and is expected to boost the popularity of such sports in the country.  In 2015, the Beijing municipal government issued a plan to accelerate the development of winter sports from 2016 to 2022 - the first in China to be made by a local government.  Under the plan, Beijing will build 16 public indoor and 50 outdoor skating rinks, and 30 small ski areas by 2022. It will also improve 22 existing ski resorts.  Beijing has also set a city goal of 40 billion yuan ($5.8 billion) in revenue for the winter sports industry by 2022."

In September, Beijing had ""good"" air quality on 53.3 percent of the days, down 13.4 percentage points from the share in the same period last year. Density of PM10 surged by a staggering 53.8 percent in the capital. Nationwide, the 338 cities monitored by the MEP reported good or excellent air quality on 79.4 percent of the days in the first three quarters, slight down from the same period last year. Air quality usually worsens in winter in northern China where cold weather conditions and the burning of coal for heating combine to exacerbate the situation. To improve air quality in the season, the MEP has started rounds of on-site environmental inspections in cities around the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area."
0,"Many visitors to Beijing enjoy staying in traditional hutong (alleyways). The neighborhoods, with narrow stairs, open courtyards and swooping eves hark to olden days at a time when the skyline increasingly sparkles with high rises. This has inspired some residents like globetrotting documentary director Gu Yue to put his house on the globally popular short-stay homerental platform, Airbnb. ""Encountering different people is the best part of traveling,"" the 39-year-old Beijing native says. ""I can communicate with them and learn about their cultures. Being an Airbnb host enables me to have such experiences."" Gu moved to the United States at age 10 and returned 16 years later. He resigned from GE Capital at age 24 and spent two years backpacking through 18 countries. Four years later, he hitch-hiked from Beijing across 13 countries with 88 drivers to meet his girlfriend in Berlin. ""Although I'm often traveling, I'm proud of Beijing's history and culture,"" he says. ""I want to promote these among visitors."" He recently renovated his rented courtyard home in the city's historical Gulou area, near the ancient Drum and Bell Towers. The floors and water are heated. The residence has a kitchen and three bedrooms, each with a bathroom. A skylight and French windows provide good lighting and views of his courtyard, in which a tree towers and grape vines slither up a trellis. The interior is decorated with travel books and items from around the world, ranging from small African ornaments to a skirt from an ethnic group in Pakistan. He rents out one bedroom when he's gone. His expat roommates and friends help guests, and he chats with visitors online if they like. Gu joined Global Host Q&A, in which Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky answered questions from hosts, earlier this month. He's the first Chinese Airbnb host to attend the event, he says.,""I've got a lot to worry about as a new Airbnb host. But I'm willing to learn,"" he says. ""For example, can they find the place? Are they enjoying their stay?"" He's happy to share local travel tips with visitors. ""First-time visitors' agendas are topped by scenic spots and historical sites. I recommend they stroll along the hutong to encounter locals,"" he says. ""Observation is the secret to making your trip less formulaic. A hutong provides a different lifestyle than a downtown hotel."" Gu knows the best eateries, ranging from locals' favorites to Western restaurants, hidden in zigzagging hutong. He has stayed in many Airbnb homes during his travels. ""So, I also do my best to ensure guests enjoy what I offer,"" he says. He recently stayed in an elegant century-old palace owned by an eminent family in Fez, Morocco. It was tastefully decorated with colored glass, crystal and handmade mosaic tiles. Airbnb guests' fees are used for its upkeep. ""You can have a spectacular experience there. And it's not expensive,"" he says. ""It's challenging for the family's descendants to maintain such a spacious palace."" He recalls his early years as a traveler. ""It's hard at first. You don't know what will happen. You might get sick or robbed."" But his memories of those journeys are mostly fond. ""I collect travel experiences like some people collect shoes,"" he says. ""Travel shows me the possibilities within myself, such as my connection with the world. The books you've read, the people you've known and the places you've been gradually shape your way of thinking."""

The book, published by Qingdao Publishing House, features his jottings about the food he has tasted at home and abroad in recent years. And it ranges from Cantonese food and spicy Sichuan dishes to a small French restaurant in Paris. The book also delves into the history and culture of Chinese food, and introduces traditional Chinese foods eaten at various times of the year, like the Spring Festival. Dong also focuses on the latest trends in the food industry, like more Chinese restaurants opening up in the central business districts overseas.,A new book by Wang Haiming, the secretary-general of the China Finance 40 Forum, a nongovernmental platform of Chinese think tanks, explores the role of conservative think tanks in US politics.

1,"Judge a man first by his shoes－so goes an old Beijing saying. Outdated it might be, but it shows that in the olden times, people of Beijing valued their shoes a great deal. Cai Wenke, chief shoemaker of Neiliansheng, a time-honored Chinese brand best known for its ""thousand-layered"" shoes made of cotton, thinks many people in Beijing still value their shoes. He is out to fulfil their need for good shoes, having devoted more than a decade already to mastering the fine craft of shoemaking. ""I started as a salesman in Neiliansheng when I was in my early 20s, and I grew fond of the craft. Like, how do you even make the sole? I realized it takes at least 2,000 stitches, sometimes 4,200, to make one,"" said Cai. ""I asked the manager to let me learn the craft, and I have been doing it ever since."" He said the making of a pair of Neiliansheng handmade cloth shoes involves over 100 processes, from drawing, draping to stitching. ""It requires one man to work eight hours for six days to make a pair,"" he said proudly, emphasizing that the process has not changed for over 100 years. ""We need to preserve the tradition and heritage."" The ""thousand-layered""－it is a gross exaggeration of the actual 30-40 layers－handmade cotton shoes were a luxury only the rich and the powerful could afford in the past. A pair of shoes that requires at least 48 hours of human labor to be made, was obviously beyond the grasp of the common man. But machine-based manufacturing led to productivity boost, making many sought-after footwear brands affordable. This factor, coupled with Neiliansheng's fixation with black-and-white cotton shoes whose basic design hardly evolved for years, meant the brand was not among the fashion icons the younger generation of consumers craved. Cai, however, thinks Neiliansheng has a bright future ahead, given that many traditional brands have reinvented themselves to be perceived as hipster favorites in recent years. For instance, by co-designing with Japan's Mitsui & Co and Sweden's Happy Socks, Neiliangsheng has made its products more global, to be appealing for the young while preserving its core values and craftsmanship. And so, in August, the 165-year-old Neiliansheng opened a pop-up shop in Sanlitun, Beijing's key commercial zone, to present its new avatar. ""It's mostly the young people who buy our shoes now,"" said Cai while measuring the feet size of a 20-year-old female consumer at the shop. The woman said she is set to go abroad for a while, so has been shopping for clothes and footwear. To wear a pair of Neiliansheng shoes that are unlikely to be found elsewhere seemed a brilliant idea to her. As Cai demonstrated his shoemaking craft at the new store, passersby, suitably impressed, placed nearly 25 orders on two afternoons. ""Now we are also heading toward being more fashionable, in design and form,"" he said. ""We have co-designed products with intellectual property such as comics."" Cheng Xu, deputy general manager of the company, said he hoped such pop-up shops would dispel the stereotypes that people hold of traditional handcrafted brands. According to a report in China Business Herald, since 2010, the brand saw steady growth in sales, with its annual revenue staying above 100 million yuan ($14.58 million). To encourage time-honored brands such as Neiliansheng to reinvent themselves and withstand competition from modern, technologically superior manufacturers, a number of ministries, including the Ministry of Commerce, released a guideline last year to promote their crafts, products and technologies unique to China. The unique products, exquisite skills and service concepts have been passed down from generation to generation. They are the carriers of the craftsman spirit of China and are of huge significance to the economy, local brands and cultural values, the guideline stated. According to the Ministry of Commerce's research, 1,128 companies are regarded as traditional Chinese brands. Their average age is 140 years. ""At least 40 percent of the traditional brands are developing well. Half of them are maintaining a stable performance, while 10 percent are facing trouble,"" said Fang Aiqing, a former vice-minister. As per official data, 788 traditional brands surveyed by the ministry earned a total revenue of over 9 trillion yuan in 2017, up 6 percent year-on-year, while their collective profit grew by 20 percent to 765.8 billion yuan."
0,"Editor's notes: Beijing will become the first city to host both Summer and Winter Olympics. Beijing 2022 can set a new benchmark for a sustainable Olympic Games, on the one hand benefiting from the legacy of the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games and on the other developing a new winter sports destination in a sustainable way. Beijing 2022 will use 26 competition and non-competition venues in three zones: downtown Beijing, the northwestern Yanqing district and co-host Zhangjiakou in North China's Hebei province, connected by a new high-speed railway to be completed by the end of 2019. In the downtown zone, where all the ice-based sports will be held, 11 of 13 venues were used during the 2008 Summer Olympics. The Water Cube, or the National Aquatic Center, a key legacy of the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics, will be turned into a competition arena for curling during the 2022 Games. The National Aquatics Center will be repurposed from Water Cube to Ice Cube with a transferable rink. Renovations are expected to start at the Water Cube by the end of this year. ""It will take us about one month to complete the water-to-ice transformation, which will involve more than 20 specific steps,"" said Yang Qiyong, general manager of the National Aquatics Center Co. After the Olympics, the curling tracks will be preserved as an Olympic legacy and open to the public.,Ice hockey will be held in a converted arena in Wukesong that was used for the basketball competition in 2008. As early as the initial construction of Wukesong Arena, ice hockey competition has been listed as one of the arena's future development directions. Ice pipes were embedded in the floor when the arena was constructed. During the basketball competition, the rink was covered by a thick ice carapace to insulate the cold and new flooring was installed for basketball. The transition work can be finished in 8 hours. The Wukesong Arena is not only used for basketball and ice hockey competition, but also as a stadium for concerts.,The National Stadium is known as the Bird's Nest and will host the opening and closing ceremonies of Beijing 2022. The reuse of ready-made facilities to optimize savings in venue operation is expected to significantly cut the cost for Beijing. ""There is absolutely no doubt about Beijing 2022 being cost-effective,"" said Christophe Dubi, the IOC's executive director for Olympic Games. According to Beijing's candidature file submitted to the IOC in 2015, the combined infrastructure and operational budgets for the 2022 Games total about $3.5 billion - significantly less than the cost of staging a Summer Olympics.,Sitting in the Olympic Forest Park next to the Beijing 2008 tennis facility, the National Speed Skating Oval, dubbed the ""Ice Ribbon"", began construction last April, with its main structure scheduled for completion this September, and is expected to be completed by the end of 2019. The oval will cover 80,000 square meters and hold a capacity of 12,000 people. The oval will stage speed skating races at Beijing 2022. Twenty-two separate light strands (or ribbons) flow up and around the oval, representing the speed and trail of this sport. At night, the facade will create an exciting spectacle, with each of the strands becoming dynamic ribbons of light, able to change to an endless array of lighting programs. Its 12,000-square-meter ice-covered areas will enable it to become the largest skating facility in Asia. The new speed skating oval will be able to serve amateur skaters in all seasons after 2022 with a 10,000-square-meter public rink, also a fitting addition to the architectural legacy of the Olympics.,Big air snowboarding a new event added to the Pyeongchang Winter Games, also will be included in the 2022 Games. A main structure of the big air facility in Beijing, standing 60 meters high and 160 meters long, will be built at the Shougang Industrial Park, which evolved from a former steel mill closed down in 2008 ahead of the Beijing Summer Olympics. Construction on the project will begin in the second half of this year. Against the backdrop of an industrial tower, Shijing Mountain and Yongding River, the big air snowboarding venue will become another Olympic landmark building in Beijing. After the Games, the facility can still be used for competitions and training. It can also serve to promote ice and snow sports open to the public, which reflect the concept of sustainability and injects vigor into the region's development."
1,"US home-sharing platform Airbnb has suspended a plan to provide lodging on the Badaling Great Wall in Beijing amid concerns that it could damage the ancient structure. The company said on Tuesday that it will not move forward with the original plan out of respect for public opinion, though the event－known as Night at the Great Wall－had been given a nod by relevant parties. The company said it does not want to distract from the goal of enhancing ""human connections"", but didn't say if the event will be held somewhere else nearby. But the cultural commission in Beijing's Yanqing district－which oversees the Badaling Great Wall－released a statement on Monday saying it was not aware of the event and no approval had been given. The commission said it does not support such activities as they don't help conserve cultural heritage. It cited several laws and rules on the protection of cultural relics. The event caused an uproar after Chinese netizens voiced concerns about potential damage to the ancient military fortification. The company first revealed the event on its website on Thursday. It offered overnight lodging in September for one Airbnb user and a companion in a ""room"" transformed from a torch tower on the Badaling Great Wall. The room would be equipped with a bathroom, the company said. The company has held similar activities in a number of countries, including on a reef in the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, and the Dracula Castle in Romania."
0,"Beijing prosecutors are working with the municipal government and education institutes to set up a system to better protect children against abuse.  The city's procuratorate signed a framework agreement on Wednesday with several departments and agencies, including those responsible for schools, civil affairs and social security, to create a network to identify minors at risk.  ""The system will help us spot clues as well as send advice on juvenile protection to schools and administrations,"" said Zhen Zhen, the deputy chief procurator. ""We also hope departments will provide feedback and share information about juvenile cases through the system.""  She added that the system will also be used to increase children's awareness of how to protect themselves.  News of the system came as the Beijing People's Procuratorate reported that courts citywide had handled 1,108 criminal cases that involved children age 17 or under between 2014 and 2016. The children had been injured or sexually assaulted by an adult.  ""Cases in which adults harmed a juvenile have risen rapidly in the past three years,"" said Yue Huiqing, director of the procuratorate's juvenile crime department, which handles crimes committed by or against juveniles.  Abuse of a child accounts for about the two-thirds of the department's cases, ""and the number is going up, with most offenses being sexual assaults"", she said.  Some 1,255 offenders received ""strict punishments"" over the three years, Yue said. However, she added: ""Child victims have little awareness of self-protection and are sometimes afraid to tell their parents after they are assaulted, which makes it difficult for us to investigate and collect evidence.""  She said many sexual assaults of children were perpetrated by someone familiar to the victim, and that the age of minor victims is becoming younger.  In May last year, a 63-year-old man surnamed Li, who was responsible for facility management in a community, was sentenced to one year in jail for sexual assault by Beijing No 2 Intermediate People's Court.  Li found that the parents of a 5-year-old girl had gone to work and left her alone playing in the community. So he took her to his rental house and sexually assaulted her, the court said.  In another case, a man surnamed Wu, a native of Hebei province, forced his niece, who was less than 12 years old, to have sex with him when he lived in her home in 2014, according to a statement from Beijing Miyun District People's Court.  Wu was sentenced in March 2015 to five years and six months in prison for rape."
0,"By hosting a number of important international events during the past five years, China has adopted an active approach to diplomacy amid efforts to improve global governance, analysts said.  Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in November 2012, the world's second-largest economy has successfully hosted a number of influential multinational events, such as the 2014 APEC Summit in Beijing, the 2016 G20 Summit in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, and the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation Beijing in May.  The latest international event hosted by China, the BRICS Summit, took place last month in the coastal city of Xiamen, Fujian province. Leaders of the five BRICS countries - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - and five representatives of other developing nations - Egypt, Mexico, Thailand, Tajikistan and Guinea - gathered to discuss measures to boost practical cooperation.  At least two important multilateral meetings are already on China's schedule in the coming two years: The Shanghai Cooperation Organization Summit will be held in June next year and the second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation will take place in 2019.  In early 2014, Foreign Minister Wang Yi raised the concept of ""host diplomacy"" while talking about China's hosting of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building in Asia Measures and the APEC meeting in the same year.  Jia Wenshan, a professor at the National Academy for Development and Strategy at Renmin University of China, said Beijing's approach to host diplomacy is infused with President Xi Jinping's concept of the Chinese Dream and a ""community of shared destiny"", which China is determined to realize.  Xi's ideas on global governance and his concept of new engines of globalization such as peace, openness and innovation are all aimed at erasing ""the deficit of peace, the deficit of development, and the deficit of governance"" in the world, he added.  Jin Yong, a professor of international relations at the Communication University of China, said the country is assuming its international responsibilities to promote common development through measures such as inviting a large number of developing nations to attend international events it hosts.  As one of the major contributors to global economic growth, China's innovative concepts on improving global governance and promoting global peace and common prosperity have gained wide recognition and support from other countries, he said."
1,"Representatives of 13 well-known commercial streets in different countries issued ""Wangfujing Consensus"" in Beijing on Thursday, which aims to build a multi-level communication and cooperation mechanism to provide better consumption experience for the public. The consensus was jointly issued at the ""international top business streets forum"" which is a part of the 6th Beijing Wangfujing International Brand Festival. The directors and representatives from top commercial streets including Wangfujing in Beijing, Ku'damm Street in Berlin and Covent Garden, London, made the statement in the consensus that they will be more open and sharing to raise the intelligence and convenience level of the commercial streets to make those streets become a great life experience center. Shi Xiaodong, deputy dean of Beijing Municipal Institute of City Planning and Design, said during the forum that Wangfujing street has a long history and rich culture, but it should build up its unique culture characteristics and rebuild the core commercial area to become a world-class commercial pedestrian street. ""The transportation can be improved while the authority should strengthen the historic culture protection,"" he said. Alexandra Tabellini, mayor of Lucca in Italy, shared his view on urban commercial development. He said the commercial activities should be in accordance with the city's residential quality and culture succession. The 13 commercial streets are Ku'damm Street, Berlin; Covent Garden, London; Central Hong Kong, HK, China; Jinbaojie, Beijing; Wangfujing, Beijing; Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street, Shanghai; Jiefangbei, Chongqing; Xinjiekou, Nanjing, Jiangsu; Chunxilu, Chengdu, Sichuan; North Huaqiang Street, Shenzhen; Guanqian Street, Suzhou, Jiangsu; Yan'an Road Business Alliance, Hangzhou, Zhejiang; Quancheng Road, Jinan, Shandong."
0,"BEIJING - Have you ever thought about changing your job due to being squeezed for over 45 minutes in a metro carriage each day? Researchers used transit smartcards from travelers in Beijing retained over a seven-year period from 2011 to 2017 to track boarding and alighting metro stations associated with home and work location. They tracked who moved and who remained at their homes and workplace and provided a longitudinal study of job and housing dynamics with group conceptualization and characterization. With the seven-year transit smartcard dataset, researchers traced individual trajectories of residences and workplaces. Based on in-metro travel times before and after job and/or home moves, they found that 45 minutes is an inflection point where the behavioral preference changes. Commuters whose travel time exceeds the point prefer to shorten commutes by moving, while others with shorter commutes tend to increase travel time for better jobs and/or residences. Moreover, the researchers captured four mobility groups -- home mover, job hopper, job-and-residence switcher and stayer. Stayers with a high job and housing stability tend to be apartment owners subject to middle- to high-income groups. Home movers work at places similar to stayers, while they may upgrade from tenancy to ownership. Switchers increase commute time as well as housing expenditure via job and home moves, as they pay for better residences and work farther from home. Job hoppers mainly reside in the suburbs, suffer from long commutes, change jobs frequently and are likely to be low-income migrants. The research was jointly conducted by the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research of Chinese Academy of Sciences, the University of Sydney, the University of Hong Kong and Beijing Jiaotong University. Residential locations, the jobs-housing relationship and commuting patterns are key elements to understand the urban spatial structure and how city dwellers live. Their successive interaction is important for various fields including urban planning, transport, intraurban migration studies and social science. However, understanding of the long-term trajectories of the workplace and home location and the resulting commuting patterns is still limited due to the lack of year-to-year data tracking individual behavior."
0,"A new form of theater, which can be watched on the big screen, is gaining favor among young Chinese audiences. It was announced on Wednesday in Beijing that a new season starting from July will include 23 new titles from various live-theater broadcasting projects from London, Moscow and Broadway. This is in addition to a list of 23 productions that have already been screened in 21 cities across the Chinese mainland and Taiwan over the past two years, according to Beijing-based ATW Culture Media Ltd, a distributor of National Theatre Live. ""This is the third year we have brought theater live to the China market, and we have seen a tremendous increase in the number of viewers and venues,"" says Li Congzhou, CEO, ATW Culture. In 2009, the Royal National Theatre in London started its NT Live initiative, which broadcasts high-definition live performances of their productions to cinemas and arts venues around the world. The new form soon became a hit among theater lovers. The project was officially introduced to China in 2015. Since then, 39 venues have joined the program, attracting 150,000 viewers with more than 1,000 screenings. The ticket price is set at 120 yuan ($17). Chen Qiaoyi, a bank clerk in her 20s, has watched five NT live performances in Beijing. She first learned about it from a friend who liked the British actor Tom Hiddleston, who featured in the first series of NT Live screenings in China. ""I was more immersed in the play than I expected,"" says Chen. ""The shooting was great. Most plays come in small theater productions. This was shot from different angles. It maximizes what it feels like to be on the spot."" Chen is typical of the current foreign-theater audience in China. ATW Culture's Li identifies them as mainly between 20 to 35 years old, female and well-educated. Most are fans of US and British television and films. In recent years, China has caught the world's attention with its fast-growing entertainment industry and an increasingly sophisticated audience. Award-winning musical classics such as Avenue Q and Wicked, and more experimental productions, such as Sleep No More, have all tested the China market. In addition to new screenings, Wednesday also witnessed the launch of the First International Theater Live Festival, which ATW Culture expects to play a role in promoting the new format to a wider audience. He says he hopes more middle school students can start to appreciate theater live to hone their language skills and cultural knowledge. As a new format of theater embracing modern technology, it is also helping to upgrade the performing arts scene in China."
1,"Bigger is better, said Xu Junyang, a securities analyst in Beijing, when asked what kind of vehicle he was looking for at a dealership. As his wife will soon give birth to their second child, the 39-year-old has decided to replace his four-year old five-seat Buick Lacrosse with a larger vehicle. ""Cars with plenty of room are the priority, those that can carry at least three adults, two safety chairs, two baby carriages and a lot more,"" Xu said. He is not alone. China's introduction of the second-child policy at the beginning of 2016 has spurred a huge demand for bigger vehicles among young couples. There were more than 17 million newborn babies last year, of which more than half were second children, soaring by 11 percent compared with the previous year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. ""Even if we don't have a second child now, buying a big SUV is the long-term plan,"" said Lin Li, a 26-year-old college graduate in Beijing. Lin bought a Toyota Highlander this year as her budget excluded the possibility of buying a second car in the coming four or five years. ""Why not consider bigger ones at the outset?"" Lin said, adding that she might have two children in the future. Lin said a bigger car had always been her first choice as her family will have at least seven members, including her parents and parents-in-law. ""For younger buyers, bigger cars have also become a popular choice because they look more cool and driving them brings a feeling of adventure,"" she said. Some people who have two children and old parents are shifting toward MPVs, with Volkswagen's Sharan and Honda's Odyssey being popular choices. Cao Jian, an IT specialist in Beijing, traded up his Volkswagen Sagitar sedan for a seven-seat Odyssey in June. ""I wanted a big SUV, but the comfort and roominess of MPVs finally gained the upper hand,"" said Cao, whose parents are over 70 years old. He said MPV bodies are lower and thus more suitable for older passengers and their seats are more comfortable than those of SUVs. ""What impressed my wife and me is that the Odyssey's seats in the second row can be laid flat and you can sleep on them, which is great for both kids and parents,"" Cao said. He said the decision came after he test-drove big SUVs including the Toyota Highlander and Peugeot 5008, but their seats were not comfortable enough, and the Volkswagen Teramont was too big for him. ""We don't need great performance or clearance ability; what we need is space and comfort,"" he added. However, for those who enjoy self-driving tours, big SUVs such as the Teramont or Toyota Prado are popular. Wang Lina, a 35-year old businesswoman who is planning a trip to the Tibet autonomous region during the National Day holiday, said big SUVs are a ""natural choice"" for her. ""You are not worried even if some road sections are poorly surfaced, because SUVs can handle such conditions,"" said Wang, who often takes her family to suburban areas for fun. ""Besides, there is more legroom in SUVs, so you are less tired than in a sedan if you travel long distances. And I'm told bigger cars are safer if there is an accident,"" she said. Statistics from the China Tourism Academy showed that Chinese people made 223 million self-driving trips in the first half of 2017, with the average distance standing at 142.8 kilometers. Of the drivers, more than 80 percent were aged between 31 and 35. The academy said these people are mainly middle and high-income earners and they are more interested in the travel experience than their destinations. These trends have driven up sales of SUVs in the past few years. Last year, more than 10 million SUVs were sold, up 13.32 percent year-on-year, according to statistics from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. In the first half of this year, the SUV sector was also the fastest growing in the Chinese auto market, with sales soaring nearly 6.3 percent year-on-year to 4.69 million vehicles. Even though the growth rate has slowed in the past few months, major carmakers are still ramping up efforts to develop SUV models, sensing demand from people who need to drive on various road conditions across the country. Beijing Automotive Group Co Ltd, one of China's top five automakers by sales revenue, for example, said it is investing more resources to develop its SUV business. ""The SUV market is growing at a fast pace and people have big aspirations for that. This is an area in which we want to be uniquely positioned,"" said Xu Heyi, chairman of BAIC Group. ""We will focus on improving off-road vehicle offerings because consumers today have higher demands for their SUVs' functionality,"" Xu said. Wang Zilin is one of them. Wang and his wife work in Qingdao in East China's Shandong province, but they travel to their hometown in the rural area of Linyi in the same province two times a month. Wang said there are rugged road sections during the three-hour drive. ""It is more comfortable to drive a big SUV as it can handle those uneven roads better,"" he said, adding that the seats on SUVs are higher, allowing drivers to see the road more clearly, which guarantees better views and travel safety."
0,"A well-known school for migrant children in Beijing has been ordered to close down after operating for 20 years. The Education Commission of Shijingshan District posted an open letter on Aug 7 to parents of students at the Huangzhuang School, announcing the school would close down because its license had expired. The commission promised to relocate students to nearby establishments, and provide or recommend new positions to its teachers. Two days later, the property owner of the premises on which the school sits, Beijing Jindu Landscaping and Greening Co Ltd, issued a notice to the school saying it will take back the land rented to it because it violated its contract — by subleasing part of the land to a third party and building illegal constructions on the land. Access to the school has been blocked by security workers from the company, which said the supply of electricity and water to the school will be cut off on Aug 24. The Huangzhuang School, a non-public school founded in 1998, has more than 1,700 students, nearly all children of migrant workers. It was granted a license in 2009 and is thought to be the largest school for migrant children in Beijing, offering education to pre-school, primary school and junior middle school students. Chen Enxian, headmaster of the school, said it signed a lease contract in 2005 on the use of 1 hectare of land with the predecessor of Jindu Landscaping and Greening, an entity affiliated to the Beijing Gardening and Landscaping Bureau. The contract was supposed to expire in 2025. Chen denied the company's claim that the school violated the contract, saying the school has rights to sublease part of the land according to an addendum signed in 2007. Chen admitted some new buildings erected after the contract was signed have not been granted property ownership certificates from authorities.,In response to questions on the expiring license, Chen said he went to the district education commission in March to apply for renewal of the license, which was supposed to expire in March. The district education commission only extended the validity of the license to August. Usually, such a renewal would make the license valid for another three years. In contrast, Meng Yun, an official from the Education Work Committee of Shijingshan district, a Party-run agency, told Caixin.com in a report last week ""Huangzhuang School did not ask for renewal of the license after it expired, and the district education commission extended the contract to August to not disrupt normal teaching activities."" Chen Enxian said in July he negotiated with the district's education commission and Jindu Landscaping and Greening in the hopes of continuing to run the school at a campus of a nearby vocational high school. However, Chen said they did not reach an agreement, because the 16 classrooms offered were not enough to accommodate all the students, and only students from second to sixth grades in primary school would be allowed to go to the new campus. In an open letter calling for help dated Aug 19, Chen said the Hua'ao School, another migrant school that will accommodate primary school students from Huangzhuang, is not ""comparable with Huangzhuang School both in facilities and management levels"". According to the notice from the Shijingshan district education commission, the students who have signed up at Huangzhuang School for the new semester are allowed to register at designated kindergartens, primary and junior middle schools. The commission said that by Monday, more than 90 percent of the students registered with Huangzhuang School have signed up at new schools. But Chen Enxian said he is afraid that when the existing students graduate, the designated schools would not enroll new migrant students in the future. The mother of a 3-year-old girl, also surnamed Chen, said she had registered her daughter at the pre-school section of the Huangzhuang School in July. However, she did not pay tuition fees, therefore her daughter was not on the student roll recognized by the district education commission. As a result, her daughter was not permitted to attend the public kindergarten designated to accommodate kids from Huangzhuang School. She had to ask Chen Enxian, the headmaster, to provide a document proving her daughter has signed up at the school.,""The tuition fees of nearby private kindergartens cost more than 3,000 yuan a month, more than double the fees of Huangzhuang School,"" said the mother. ""If my daughter cannot go to the public kindergarten, we have to move to suburbs farther away, where house rents and tuition are cheaper."" Another parent surnamed He said his home is close to the Huangzhuang School, and he sends his child to school by bicycle every day. The new school is much farther from his home. He said he might have to send his child back to his hometown if the Huangzhuang School is closed. Yang Leiqing is a former student of Huangzhuang School, and came to Beijing from his hometown in Sichuan province to join his parents in the late 1990s. After he moved to Beijing, Yang was first enrolled at a public primary school in the city's suburban district of Tongzhou after his parents paid a hefty fee. Yang said the three years in that school, in which he was the only non-local student, does not carry pleasant memories. Yang recalled the discrimination he felt from his schoolmates. ""Once, we played soccer on a hot day. During the break, one of my classmates bought some bottled water and everyone in the game received one, except for me."" Yang said he could not fit into the circle of local students, a situation that only changed when he transferred to Huangzhuang School in fourth grade. ""In Huangzhuang School, all the students are non-locals and come from across the country,"" he said. In the four years in the school, he developed a close bond with his classmates and teachers, lasting to today. ""The school has a wonderful atmosphere of learning. Even after class, my math teacher Mr He would stay in the classroom to answer our questions, and sometimes he had a small contest for solving math problems to keep up our interest in the subject,"" Yang said. A teacher who has been working at Huangzhuang School for 20 years told Caijing magazine on condition of anonymity that after receiving notice the school will be closed, he has decided to send his child back to his hometown, where his wife would take care of him. ""No one can take care of the child back in my hometown. If he goes back alone, he would become a left-behind child,"" said him. The teacher said he himself will leave Beijing eventually. By the end of 2017, the city had 7.9 million migrant residents, accounting for more than one-third of the total population."

1,"Chinese technology company Founder Group plans to build healthcare clusters in five regions, including the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta regions, by 2020, to take advantage of the huge opportunities brought by the new round of reforms. Many of these opportunities come from China's growing demand for quality healthcare solutions and medicines. Such demand comes against a background of a government's plan announced in March to make coordinated moves to accelerate research and development for various types of drugs and medical equipment, reform healthcare pricing, staffing and remuneration, and medicine distribution. The other two regions are the Chengdu-Chongqing area and the Nanjing area. The group, which was established by Peking University in 1986, has already established industrial parks in Beijing and Suzhou, and will build a new one in Chongqing in the second half of this year. Li Haisheng, general manager of PKU-Care Industrial Park Technology Co, the healthcare industrial development platform of Founder Group, said unlike pharmaceutical plant-themed healthcare industrial zones or parks, these clusters are formed by high-end healthcare service and solution providers, biopharmaceutical companies and medical equipment manufacturers. ""The parks in these five regions will have different pillar businesses, some of them will focus on developing 3-D printing, surgical robots and medical equipment manufacturing, some will cultivate businesses to conduct research and development for gene therapy and integrated artificial intelligence products, based on their regional economic character,"" said Li. Founder Group built its first health industrial park in Beijing in 2012. It includes chemical, biological and animal labs, which are designed to meet international standards recognized by the United States Food and Drug Administration. The park now has more than 150 biotech companies and research institutes. Their objectives are to further contribute to long-term development of the biotech industry, so as to seek effective solutions for major problems such as long research and development cycles, financial issues and resource shortages. ""The development of high-end healthcare industries can be a flexible solution to support China's public health services, as well as further compete with other established foreign rivals in the same field,"" said Li. ""We will further diversify the methods of operating the industrial park assets, and the integration of incubation and scientific technology service systems. ""As China joins the ranks of middle-income countries, the demand for health services has increased substantially. New technologies and solutions can help alleviate the problem of inaccessible and expensive public health services that have long been a big concern for the general public,"" he said. Under the company's plan, supporting sectors such as precision medicine and the development of big data systems for healthcare will be priorities for all five clusters. Eager to enhance the country's service ability in healthcare sector, the central government announced in April that it will allow medical institutions to conduct internet-based medical services as part of a broader push to promote internet-plus healthcare (that is, using the digital medium to deliver healthcare services). Medical institutions will be allowed to provide online diagnostic services for some common and chronic diseases in patients' follow-up visits to their doctors. As digital technologies have transformed the healthcare industry dramatically, Li said the use of smart and wearable devices, and other solutions, can effectively collect health and contextual data, allowing patient monitoring anywhere in the future. ""The scope of such devices is significant, potentially leading to fewer readmissions, more rapid emergency responses, and more immediate care to avoid deterioration or adverse events, such as stroke or falls,"" he said. China has already moved through the phases like educating many young scientists and researchers, and translating their academic skills into product development and solution skills, said Zhang Yuxin, a professor at the School of Public Health, China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning province. Founder Group owns six companies listed on the stock exchanges in Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong. Its core businesses are information technology, healthcare, industry finance and vocational education."
0,"China's internet powerhouses are striving ahead as pioneers in a government-led reform to shake up the country's bloated State-owned enterprises. The introduction of a host of tech giants as strategic investors in the nation's second largest telecom operator underpins Beijing's hope to overhaul bulky SOEs to shift to better productivity using their expertise and experience, analysts said. The bloc comprises perhaps the most famous names in the technology field, including gaming and social giant Tencent Holdings Ltd, search engine Baidu Inc, e-commerce majors Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and JD.com Inc, all of which are prolific buyers overseas. Martin Lau, president of Tencent, told investors on Wednesday that the move is a ""monumental step"" in China's economic restructuring effort. The company invested 11 billion yuan ($1.65 billion) to claim 5.18 percent of China United Network Communications Group Co Ltd's Shanghai listed arm. Baidu, which accounts for 3.3 percent of the new venture, said in a statement that it is confident about the future of artificial intelligence and how its applications in areas like autonomous driving will fuel new momentum for telecom carriers. The inclusion of China's top-tier tech firms in such a sensitive industry symbolizes Beijing's determination to carry out the reform in a thorough and open manner, said Xue Yongfeng, deputy general manager of the research unit at Beijing-based Analysys. ""Each of these participants is an experienced investor. They know how to bring business synergies and create value in a culturally diverse environment,"" he said. Tencent, Alibaba and Baidu, often known as the country's ""technology trinity"", have altogether spent $112.4 billion in 174 overseas deals since 2012, according to market intelligence group Mergermarket in June. The benefits of investing in China Unicom also include strengthening ties with a company responsible for rolling out the next-generation technology that is essential for keeping customers loyal to their online services, said Peter Liu, research director at IT consultancy Gartner Inc. ""There's clearly a gap between the (tech firms') desires to deploy new technology and the current internet infrastructure,"" Liu said, adding that this is notably holding back developments in the realm of AI and virtual reality. ""Capital injection would help relieve financial burdens for the cellular carrier to push ahead with its 5G deployment, which would in turn benefit internet companies,"" he said. Pursuit of data is also a major motive behind the deal, said Xue from Analysys. Dozens of emerging businesses, from bike rental, smart delivery, to the still-nascent connected healthcare services, all rely on secure and stable mobile connectivity. ""As the internet is so mobile dominated, tech players may need operator-level data to gain full access to people's online behavior and cash in on such information under proper guidance,"" he said."
0,"Drivers parking illegally in Beijing may get double punishments if a new draft regulation is finalized, Beijing News reported. According to the draft launched by the Legal Affairs Office of the People's Government of Beijing Municipality and open for public opinion from April 11 to May 10, a driver who parks their car illegally in a non-designated spot may be fined 200 yuan ($29), and have three demerit points included on their driver's license. In China drivers will be disqualified from driving after accumulating 12 demerit points, according to current law. The city's traffic administration displays ""No Parking"" signs at busy roadsides and places around hospitals and shopping centers, the report said. With seven sections and 61 rules, the draft also sets regulations on issues such as the planning and construction of parking facilities, and has specifications on companies that provide parking services. The new regulation may take effect this year, according to the Beijing Municipal Commission of Transport. This will be the capital's first local law focusing on parking management."
0,"A man was hospitalized after he detonated a firecracker-like device in an intersection near the United States embassy in Beijing around 1 pm on Thursday. The incident is an isolated one, Chinese authorities said. The 26-year-old man, surnamed Jiang, is from Tongliao, Inner Mongolia autonomous region, Beijing police said in a statement. His motive was unknown. He was treated for a hand injury. No one else was hurt, the police said. Police found a lighter, debris of firecrackers and three unexploded firecrackers, each measuring 19.5 centimeters long and 3.5 cm in diameter. Jiang's family told the police he had suffered from visual and auditory hallucinations since 2016 and had received treatment. Police checked his medical records and found he had been diagnosed with paranoid personality disorder. On Thursday afternoon, blood and glass debris were still visible at the intersection of Tianze and Anjialou roads in Chaoyang district, which is about 30 meters from the embassy's entrance for visa applicants. Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said on Thursday that the incident was isolated and that the police had dealt with it in a timely and appropriate manner. The US embassy confirmed in a statement on Thursday that there had been an explosion at about 1 pm on the street outside the southeast corner of the compound. The police immediately responded, and there was no damage to embassy property, it said. Visa services at the embassy were temporarily affected but soon resumed, according to a visa applicant surnamed Li, who had been standing in line outside the compound for a scheduled interview at 1:15 pm. ""I was waiting to go inside the embassy when I heard a loud bang behind me. It sounded like someone lit up a firecracker. Then I noticed the smoke rising,"" Li said."
0,"Dirty street in Sanlitun was once famous for cheap food and drinks. Tian Liming, who has lived in the area for more than 50 years, knows all too well how the bar-and-restaurant-strewn thoroughfare lived up to its nickname.  The Sanlitun South No 42 apartment building stands at one end of the 200-meter-long Tonglihou street - Dirty street's official name - which connects the two parts of the Taikoo Li shopping complex. ""Small businesses grew out of these apartments like aggressive tumors,"" the 60-year-old said.  The rise of the street in Chaoyang district began when the number of visitors surged after the southern section of the popular complex was opened in 2008 as the city hosted its first Olympic Games. Many entrepreneurs saw great business opportunities, Tian recalled.  Since it was much cheaper to rent apartments than retail premises in nearby high-end commercial spaces, serving holes appeared in a number of street-facing exterior walls of the building's ground floor apartments. A large number of apartments, including many above ground level, were converted into bars, eateries and stores.  Soon, the illegal construction reached a point where it was impossible to see the real exterior walls, prompting concerns among local residents that some buildings' structural integrity had been damaged and posed a safety risk, according to Tian.    Soon, the street in front of his residential building was constantly covered by trash, as well as vomit and urine from drunken late-night revelers. ""The street became smelly and sticky. People then started to call it 'Dirty street', and it became famous among young people and expats,"" Tian said.  He witnessed the removal of the ""tumors"" on April 24, when the Beijing government launched a citywide campaign to block unauthorized business openings in the walls of buildings in residential areas.  On the first day, 33 businesses situated in Tian's apartment building were stripped of their unauthorized constructions and the original walls were restored. He said he was delighted, but was wary of showing his feelings in front of people who were sad to see the street lose its former ""glory"".  ""For years, those businesses that some treasured deeply had been a nightmare for local residents - if they could sleep at night, that is. A friend in my building called the police five times in one night to complain about the loud noise coming from the bars,"" he said, as he stood in front of a belt of grass that was previously covered by several small eateries. Now, only the electricity cables covered in evaporated grease remind people of the outlets' existence.  Like many residents, Tian's friend decided to move. Only about a dozen original residents of the building stayed. After the renovation, people began to move back. Moreover, the incidence of crime on the street fell by one-third, according to Liu Zhe, deputy director of the Sanlitun police station.  Tian believes the authorities should have tackled the situation a long time ago, but taking action was not as easy as he imagines.  The process of converting ground-floor apartments or courtyards in hutong - traditional alleyways - into private businesses began as China pursued the reform and opening-up policy in the 1980s and '90s, said Zhao Yong, deputy director of the Sanlitun urban management team.  ""This unauthorized behavior gradually became a common practice all over the city. Beijing has clearly grown out of that phase and things need to be strictly regulated from now on,"" he said. ""The removal of illegal constructions in the infamous 'Dirty street' demonstrates the Beijing government's determination, and the business owners know that.""  He added that some businesses in apartment buildings remain open because their business licenses and rental contracts are still valid, but unsurprisingly business has plummeted as they are no longer visible from the street and customers have to approach them through residential entrances.  ""Who knows how much longer they can survive?"" he said.By the end of July, more than 23,390 sites with unauthorized openings had been dealt with around the city, and the municipal government has stated that new unauthorized constructions will not be tolerated.  In addition to removing safety hazards, the citywide campaign is also expected to make central Beijing less crowded and provide room for improvements, such as the construction of parks and facilities to make people's lives more comfortable.  The goal is to develop Beijing into world-class capital city and improve the general standard of living, according to a draft of the Beijing Overall Urban Development Plan, which was published in March. The process, which began last year, will continue until 2030.  In February, President Xi Jinping said the urban planners must think deeply about how the city should look and devise ways to strengthen its function as the capital.  According to the draft, Beijing will further restore the traditional appearance of neighborhoods during the campaign. In August, the revised plan was approved by the central government, the Beijing Municipal Commission of Development and Reform said.  Xisibeitoutiao, a 600m-long hutong in Xicheng district, has existed since the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368), when Beijing became the capital. As one of the best-preserved hutong neighborhoods in the city, it was also among the first to launch the campaign.  ""Some stores selling electronic accessories near the entrances to Xisibeitoutiao had doors that opened into the hutong. Trucks would block the alleyway for hours every time new stock was unloaded,"" said Zhang Xiaozhen, who has lived in the area for 15 years.  Since 14 wall openings in the hutong were blocked at the end of last year, the 63-yearold has noticed obvious changes.  ""The alleyway is much cleaner and quieter than before. The blocked walls looked quite ugly at the beginning, but now workers have started to repaint and decorate them to restore the traditional courtyard appearance,"" she said.  ""I don't mind people running businesses from the hutong as long as they treat it as their home and take care of it. They shouldn't pour dirty water everywhere and change the structure of the houses just to make more money.""  The process hasn't won universal approval, though, and some residents have complained that they have to travel further afield for grocery shopping and for breakfast because some small businesses, such as greengrocers and restaurants, have relocated.  ""The inconvenience is only temporary. The planning of new supermarkets and convenience stores started even before the campaign was launched. Our goal is to ensure that hutong residents can find a supermarket or convenience store within 15 minutes' walking distance,"" said Wei Jiuhong, deputy director of Xinjiekou subdistrict, which administers the hutong located on Xisibei street.  To accommodate people's needs, more than 3,000 greengrocers, convenience stores and restaurants that offer breakfast had been built or upgraded by the end of July, according to the city's development and reform commission.  The new convenience stores will also reserve spaces for former street traders who provide bike and shoe repairs, Wei said. ""People need their skills, so we want to encourage them to continue their businesses in regulated areas.""  Thomas Angotti, a professor of urban affairs and planning at Hunter College in New York, believes that the campaign in Beijing has many parallels with the development of the ""Big Apple"".  ""The campaign in Beijing seems to be a response to interests by national and international capital to locate in central areas where land values and business potential are higher. Building regulations and zoning, when strictly applied, can be the mechanism (for that),"" he said.  New York is now divided into three basic zones - residential, commercial and manufacturing - and construction application forms and permitted uses are strictly applied in all of them. Residents can use the city's urban planning website to discover their neighborhood's zonal code and work out if they are allowed to operate businesses there.  Angotti suggested that before it takes action the Beijing government should make greater efforts to work with small businesses to improve their compliance with local laws. In many places, governments provide incentives, grants and assistance, he said.  Back in Beijing, ""Dirty street"" is no longer dirty, according to Tian: ""The city is changing so quickly. I can't imagine what it will look like in 10 years' time. All I know is that it is my home, whatever changes are made."""
1,"Topographically treacherous Guiyang has used innovation to transform its geological disadvantages into advantages, especially during the most recent stage of reform and opening-up. Its mountains have proved to be development hurdles, sometimes literally, in areas such as transportation infrastructure. Yet that very geology is now proving to be a boon rather than a bane for the development of Guiyang and surrounding areas in Guizhou province. That is because it is seismically stable, and its altitudes produce relatively steady, cool temperatures year-round, which makes it ideal for big data infrastructure. Guizhou's data economy grew by 37 percent last year, and its value addition is expected to account for 30 percent of the province's GDP by 2020. Guiyang has ranked No 1 among provincial capitals in GDP growth for the past five years. Its GDP reached 353.8 billion yuan ($50.9 billion) last year, about 79 times the 1978 figure based on comparable prices, with annual growth averaging 12.3 percent over the past four decades. The city's big data is transforming sectors such as agriculture, healthcare and transport cargo across the province, country and world. Truck driver Gao Dabao said big data collection in Guiyang has changed his life through a single app - Huochebang. He used to find work by driving around shipping centers throughout the country, looking at lists hung on lobby walls to see what goods were being sent when and where, and for what price. ""It was inconvenient and tiring,"" Gao said. ""Now, I just search Huochebang to find cargo to drive. It's easy."" Based in Guiyang, Huochebang is the country's largest shipment information internet platform. It links 5.2 million trucks with 1.25 million users - businesses and individuals - who want cargo transported. ""Our main target is to solve problems in the informatization of truck and cargo matching,"" said Zhao Qiang, vice-president of Huochebang. ""This can lower logistics costs, which benefits all of society. ""We've grown rapidly since we arrived in Guizhou in 2014, when big data was booming. Big data helps us understand more about such areas as trucks and human behaviors. So it empowers the industry."" Big data also enables the establishment of credit systems and conflict mediation, he said, adding: ""There were often disagreements due to a lack of credibility. Drivers are graded according to big data. That can extend to loans."" In the past four years, Huochebang has grown from a small acorn into a unicorn, a startup valued at $1 billion. ""The market for truck drivers is huge - so huge that it'll be worth more than 1 trillion yuan in the near future,"" Luo Peng, vice-president of Manbang Group, which owns Huochebang, said in June. ""The domestic logistics supply is very fragmented. China now has around 1.5 million logistics companies and tens of millions of truckers. As an industrial internet platform, we need to ramp up resources to better serve the drivers via emerging technologies such as big data and artificial intelligence."" Guiyang ranks in the top 10 Chinese cities for computing power, according to the 2018 China AI Computing Power Development Report released at the 2018 AI Computing Conference in Beijing in September. Industry investment has increased tenfold in the past year, while the computing power of artificial intelligence has grown by 230 percent and the amount of data has expanded by 50 percent. Big tech giants such as Apple, Qualcomm, Huawei, Tencent, Alibaba and Foxconn have regional headquarters in the city as well as cloud-computing and big data centers. Per capita disposable income in Guiyang's urban area was 32,186 yuan last year, up by 11.9 times in real terms compared with that of 1980, with annual growth averaging about 7.2 percent. The figure for rural areas was 14,264 yuan, 12.2 times more than in 1980 in real terms, with an annual average growth of about 7.2 percent. Looking ahead, Guiyang seems poised to expand the data industries that transform its geology from a stumbling block into a launchpad in the next stages of the reform and opening-up in the new era."
0,"As the list of the teams in the ongoing 2018 FIFA World Cup has narrowed, Beijing police cracked down on an online gambling network on Thursday, arresting 46 suspects. The network's cash flow hit more than 320 million yuan ($48 million) since the tournament began, the police said on Saturday. Police focused on a Beijing resident, surnamed Zhang, who frequently made contact with overseas gambling platforms. They followed the lead and eventually discovered the network. According to the police, the network colluded with overseas online gambling platforms and became a domestic proxy, obtaining usernames and passwords for betting. Then the network broadcast daily game information－betting odds, for example－on social media networks, such as WeChat, and gradually developed lower-tier agents and members to carry out the gambling scheme. Gamblers placed bets via telephone and WeChat. Winnings were paid in a number of ways, including by cash, wire transfer and mobile payments. The network was paid a commission from overseas betting platforms based on the amount of money in play, the police said. The network was raided by more than 200 police officers at about 5 am on Thursday. They detained 46 suspects and confiscated evidence, including mobile phones, computers, ledger books and bank cards. According to the government-run sports lottery website, money spent betting on soccer matches has surged since the FIFA tournament started. Although the tournament is still in progress, about 28.55 billion yuan was spent in the soccer lottery from June 11 to July 1, double the total spent during the 2014 World Cup, which was 12.3 billion yuan. Beijing police said they will continue to crack down on illegal online betting during the tournament. They also advised netizens to stay away from online gambling, which is illegal. In 2015, multiple ministries, including the Ministry of Finance, banned online gambling and announced a crackdown. In 2016, the ban was reinforced by the ministries. While illegal gambling seeks only profit, China's sports lottery distributes money to charitable programs. In 2017, 2.65 billion yuan went to promote amateur sports programs nationwide and to support professional athletes, according to the General Administration of Sport of China."
1,"Three ex-executives of fugitive Chinese billionaire Guo Wengui have been given prison terms for fraudulently obtaining loans and foreign currency, a court said on Friday.  Lyu Tao, former deputy general manager of Beijing Pangu Investment Inc, controlled by Guo, was sentenced to two years and three months in prison, while Xie Honglin and Yang Ying, who both worked for the company's financial department, were sentenced to two years with a three-year reprieve.  The three were also fined, and the company was asked to pay 245 million yuan ($35.9 million) in fines, according to the judgment by Xigang District People's Court in Dalian, Liaoning province.  The defendants and the representative of the company said after the announcement that they will not appeal.  During the court hearing on June 9, the three confessed to obtaining a loan of 3.2 billion yuan from Agricultural Bank of China in the name of the company by using fake contracts, materials and seals in 2010.  Lyu and Xie also said they illegally obtained $13.5 million in foreign exchanges with forged invoices in 2012.  All of them expressed regret in court, adding that they were obeying Guo, who was behind all the cheating.  ""The three defendants were Guo's subordinates and acting under his orders, and they all pleaded guilty. Meanwhile, the loans have been returned. In consideration of that, we gave them lenient terms,"" the court said in the judgment.  It was the first trial of a series related to the company and Guo, who fled overseas about three years ago.  Interpol issued a ""red notice"" - the closest thing to an international arrest warrant - for Guo in April, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  Prosecutors also accused a number of people related to the company and Beijing Zenith Holdings Company of gaining benefits illegally, destroying accounting evidence and fraudulently obtaining bank loans in three separate cases, according to the court.  In addition, several connected cases involving forced transactions, offers of bribes, embezzlement and illegal detention are being handled by judicial authorities, it added.  On Tuesday, nine Chinese mainland-based construction companies jointly filed a lawsuit against Guo in the Supreme Court of the State of New York in the United States, accusing him of failing to pay project debts amounting to 272 million yuan, plus bank interest, business magazine Caixin reported."

It was co-hosted by China Tourism Academy and China Tourism Association. Keynote speakers exchanged views with each other, looked at previous achievements in the tourism industry since China’s reform and opening up in 1978, as well as looking forward to the future. Official data shows that, until the end of 2017, China boasted about 27,900 travel agencies, more than 30,000 scenic areas, and 457,800 accommodation service providers.,Last year, overseas tourist visits to China reached 139 million, representing an increase of 0.8 percent over 2016, while 5 billion domestic tourists enjoyed the nation’s attractions. Luo Shugang, minister of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of China, said in his speech that over the past four decades, China has experienced great development of its tourism, which plays a more and more important role in the economic development of society. He said the tourism industry has become a road to prosperity for farmers and helps rejuvenate the economy in rural areas. China Tourism Academy’s head, Dai Bin, said it’s essential to boost the innovation of academic theories and research about tourism, and train more talents for the industry. A supervisory mechanism is also needed to ensure tourists’ rights and enhance their travel experience."
0,"BEIJING - President Xi Jinping on Friday visited Beijing's primary-level cadres and residents in downtown neighborhoods ahead of the Spring Festival and extended Lunar New Year greetings to Chinese people of all ethnic groups. Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, also inspected the preparation work for the Beijing 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games. When inspecting the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau, Xi stressed the city's glorious mission and weighty responsibility to safeguard the social stability of the national capital as 2019 marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.,Xi asked for coordinated efforts to promote work in all fields with resolve to complete the mission. Touring a ""hutong,"" or traditional alley, in central Beijing's Qianmen area, Xi ordered the efforts to protect cultural heritage sites and conserve traditional culture while renovating the city's old areas. He called for both improving local residents' living conditions and protecting historical and cultural deposits, so that history and modernity will perfectly blend. He stressed specific measures to maintain the original features of hutong areas. Xi dropped into two courtyards along the hutong, inquiring about the living conditions of local residents after the renovation projects in the neighborhood. ""What the CPC pursues is to make the people's life better,"" he told the residents, gladly chatting and making dumplings with them.,Noting close attention from the CPC Central Committee to the renovation of old towns and shanty areas, Xi said that the Party aims to create a more comfortable and better living environment for the people and solve problems they care about most so that they can enjoy modern life even in old hutong areas. After chatting with residents, Xi went to a property service center to visit staff and community workers. On the way back, Xi dropped in on a restaurant, chatted with the owner and some customers and wished them good luck.,Xi also called on a nearby express delivery station and visited the deliverymen who were on duty, stressing that priority should be given to solving employment problems and creating more jobs. At 3:30 pm, Xi arrived at the Shougang Park in Shijingshan District, the seat of the Beijing Organizing Committee for the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games, to learn about the preparation for the Games and the planning and construction of the venues and infrastructure. Xi stressed the need to stay committed to hosting the Games in a green, sharing, open and clean manner, and to complete all preparation tasks with high standards. The venue construction must meet the Olympic standards and be completed on time, Xi said.,Stressing that the features of technology, intelligence, greenness and frugality should be highlighted, Xi said advanced technological approaches should be applied, energy-saving and environmental friendly requirements should be strictly enforced, the environment and cultural relics should be well protected, and Chinese styles should be on full display. Xi visited the office building of the Beijing Organizing Committee, meeting with some of the staff and volunteers there. Noting that Beijing will become the world's only host of both the Summer and Winter Olympics, he stressed that China must fulfill the solemn commitments it made to the world.,""Hosting the 2022 Winter Olympics is an important support to the coordinated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region,"" Xi said, adding that Hebei Province must develop together with Beijing. During his visit to the national winter sports training center, Xi stressed promoting sportsmanship with Chinese characteristics, boosting coordinated development of mass sports, competitive sports and the sports industry, and speeding up building China into a country strong on sports. Vice Premier Han Zheng, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, accompanied Xi on the inspection tour of the preparation work for the Beijing 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games."
0,"Diverse displays to promote plant varieties, cultures, geography and latest products The Beijing International Horticultural Exhibition, which is scheduled to open in the city's Yan-qing district on April 29, is expected to showcase the diverse gardening cultures from China and around the world, organizers said. With the theme of ""live green, live better"", the expo organizers and architects expressed their beliefs in a green lifestyle through the design of the gardens and pavilions, according to officials. Covering 503 hectares, 41 outdoor exhibition parks have been built by more than 80 countries and international organizations. They are comprised of 34 independent exhibition parks and seven jointly-built exhibition parks. The China Pavilion, which covers 15,000 square meters, is a landmark at the expo. With its design inspired from the traditional jade ornament ruyi, the pavilion will feature a display of age-old Chinese culture. It aims to appeal to visitors with the charms of Chinese horticulture and the achievements made by the nation's provinces and by research institutions in the industry. During the exhibition, visitors will be able to chew over the traditional Chinese norms including ""the harmony between human and nature"" through the well-presented horticultural work carried out by Chinese craftsmen. They will also get to learn about the ecosystem comprising water, forests, fields, lakes and grass via digital images.

0,"Since it opened in March last year, China's first hospice for people with terminal cancer has provided professional care and a relatively peaceful end to life for about 100 patients. Affiliated to Peking University Shougang Hospital in Beijing, the hospice serves as a ""tribute"" to the dignity of human life, even in the final stages, and the laws of nature, said Gu Jin, the founder who is also head of the hospital. The veteran cancer surgeon urged more public awareness and support for end-stage patients, who are often subjected to unnecessary treatments and have to endure the resultant pain. In such cases, quality hospice care is far more useful than costly, but redundant, medical procedures, he said. ""Hospice care helps patients who have little time left, and also reduces the financial burden on their families."" In China, the lion's share of medical resources devoted to cancer are invested in diagnosis and treatment. That means leading public hospitals lack the incentive to provide hospice care, which is labor intensive and less profitable than treatment. The Shougang hospice employs four doctors and 10 nurses, which is barely sufficient to meet demand. According to Gu, each patient spends one month on average in the hospice, but 20 to 30 new names are added to its waiting list every month. In general, hospice care involves procedures such as pain relief and psychological counseling to help provide a respectful end to life with as little suffering as possible. The risk of contracting cancer rises as people grow older. That means China's rapidly aging population may pose an increased risk of a cancer epidemic in the years to come. In many big cities, where life spans are generally longer, cancer is the leading cause of death among people with illnesses. Moreover, in Beijing, the disease accounts for 26.8 percent of all deaths, according to the city's health authority. ""The number is still rising in Beijing and across the country with the growing 'gray population',"" Gu said. By the end of last year, 241 million people in China were age 60 or older, accounting for more than 17 percent of the population. The number is expected to reach 487 million by 2050, about 35 percent of the population by that time, official statistics show. To be better prepared to cope with the rising demand for hospice services, Gu urged the government to formulate more support policies and provide financial support to train and provide more high-quality care givers. shanjuan@chinadaily.com.cn"
0,"Huang Xiaoru is happy. She won a painting award in a competition and has gone to several events organized by her primary school.  The 8-year-old and her younger brother attend Wanxiu Primary School in Nanning, Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, after migrating with their parents several years ago from a rural area.  ""Our class has 54 pupils, 44 of whom are children like Huang,"" said Chen Jinling, head teacher of Huang's class.  Instead of leaving children behind in their home villages to be cared for by aging grandparents, more Chinese migrant workers are taking them along to cities, where they can find better care and education.  China has around 14 million children who live with migrant parents in cities, and 9 million ""left-behind"" children who remain in rural areas.  In recent years, the Chinese government has urged public schools to simplify their qualification requirements and recruit as many children of migrant workers as possible to ensure the children get an education.  However, because of limited capacity, public schools in cities cannot absorb all the children of migrant workers.  ""Ten years ago when we brought our eldest daughter here, she could not enter a public school, as we only had a rural household registration,"" said Tang Haiyan, a female migrant worker in Nanning.  Things are easier now: Tang's second daughter attends a public primary school in the city.  ""Parents who have the right documents for residency and work are able to enroll their children,"" said Lei Youheng, headmaster of a primary school in Nanning.  The central government has allocated an urban-rural compulsory education fund that will benefit millions of children of migrant workers in cities. They will get free textbooks and exemptions from school fees. Living subsidies will be offered to boarding students whose families have financial difficulty.  However, gaps still remain. Cities trying to control population growth have pushed policies based on factors such as parents' jobs, educational background and property ownership, according to Qin Hongyu, a researcher at the 21st Century Education Research Institute, a nonprofit organization.  ""The score indexes are favorable for advantaged groups but unfair to rural migrant workers' children in getting equal access to education,"" he said.  Zhang Mei, a university researcher who has lived in Beijing for nearly 20 years, said: ""When the supply is not increased, newcomers and grassroots locals have to compete for education resources.""  Tan Ping, 16, is not interested in continuing at a public school in Beijing. He wants to find a job to support the family.  His father and mother are migrant workers. His mother has a kidney illness, and his two younger brothers rely on social aid to attend a private school.  Like Tan, many children of migrant workers lack a comfortable environment to continue learning after school, usually living with their parents and siblings in shabby, crowded houses, a factor leading to poor academic results.  A university survey tracking 1,866 students in 50 junior middle schools for migrant workers' children in Beijing found that only 39 percent of students continued their education into senior middle school and only 6 percent entered a university.  A sense of isolation is another challenge. The circles of friends of such children are often other migrant workers.  ""Policy barriers can be removed overnight, but psychological gaps will take two to three generations to overcome,"" said Li Tao, founder of a Beijing-based organization devoted to improving the lives of migrant workers and their children.

1,"BEIJING - The number of Chinese tourists visiting Ireland could reach 175,000 in 2025, more than double that in 2017, according to Tourism Ireland. About 70,000 Chinese visitors went to Ireland last year, up about 15 percent year-on-year, according to Niall Gibbons, chief executive of Tourism Ireland. ""China is one of Ireland's fastest growing tourism source markets, and the growth rate is likely to double in the near future,"" he added. Gibbons made the remarks at the ongoing Tourism Ireland annual travel China Sales Mission event. It will tour Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Hong Kong with the aim of sealing more partnerships and deals with local counterparts to bring more Chinese tourists to the island. A total of 20 Irish tourism market players including travel agencies, hotels and popular destinations like Guinness Storehouse, have joined this year's China Sales Mission, the largest ever held by Tourism Ireland. ""That points to increasing importance as well as our confidence of the Chinese outbound travel market,"" Gibbons said. To cater to the growing inflow of Chinese tourists, Tourism Ireland and Irish tourism partners have launched the China Ready training program, which is designed to help Irish tourism firms grab business opportunities in China such as introducing popular mobile payment tools like WeChat. Starting from June, Chinese visitors can take direct flights operated by Hainan Airlines or Cathay Pacific Airways to Dublin, either from Beijing or Hong Kong. Official data showed that China-Ireland trade volume exceeded $10 billion last year, up 36.7 percent year-on-year. ""With the opening of the two direct flights, plus growing bilateral trade, there is every indication of the continuous growth of Chinese visitors into next year and beyond,"" Gibbons said."

Released in 1997 and based on the novella  by the Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson, which was first published in 1886, the award-winning musical was written by Frank Wildhorn and Leslie Bricusse. On July 28, a Mandarin adaptation of this musical made its debut at the   Grand Theater, where it is being staged through Aug 31. The musical will then transfer to the Tianqiao Performing  s Center in Beijing from Sept 8 to 29. Set in Victorian-era London, the musical tells the story of a doctor, Henry Jekyll, who conducts an experiment on himself, which leads to the emergence of his double personality, named Edward Hyde. In the daytime, he is a respectable doctor but when night falls he turns into a ruthless criminal. The Chinese production, directed and choreographed by David Swan, has 24 Chinese actors and a 13-member orchestra, playing 32 classic songs translated from the Broadway musical hits, including    and . ""There were two main challenges: the translation and dealing with the cultural differences,"" says Swan, the American director. ""This is more difficult and more important than many may realize. The goal is for it to be as powerful and beautiful as the original, but for it to also seem as natural as though Chinese were its original language."",  ""There have been no big changes such as adding scenes, or cutting a song, but we have made some changes to the lyrics and dialogue to be able to tell the story naturally, clearly and poignantly in Chinese, as well as other relatively small changes so it feels natural for the Chinese actors and audience,"" the director adds. The musical   is the first that Swan has directed in China. He has directed the musical in a few places around the world, such as South Korea in 2004. He first saw the musical in the summer of 1990 and was impressed with the power of the show and the music. ""This story speaks to a truth about the human condition that is both universal and powerful. None of us are perfect. We all have parts of ourselves that we are not proud of and try to hide or ignore. How we deal with our faults and weaknesses and whether we let them overcome us is something we all must deal with,"" says Swan. ""The truth of that situation is something everyone can relate to and can be something that can both move an audience and make them think."" Shanghai-based company, CC Live Entertainment, the presenter of the musical, gathered together the  m behind the Chinese version of blockbuster musicals, such as  ! Zhou Xiaowei, the associate director, who translated the script and lyrics, says: ""We spent over two years preparing for the musical, and translation was one of the key parts. We have tried to make every line as meaningful as possible. While we have kept the original setting of the story in Victorian London, we have kept an eye on certain relations and interactions so they feel as familiar to Chinese audiences as possible."" Zhou also notes that with musicals becoming a popular theater genre in China over the past decade, the company will introduce more Chinese adaptations of classic Western musicals, such as .,Speaking about the cast, Swan says: ""I have been extremely impressed with the capabilities of the Chinese actors and crew. ""I believe we have been able to achieve quite a high level of sophistication in the show due to the great work and talent of all involved. So even though the industry is still young in China, I believe it has the potential to progress quickly."" Chinese actors, Liu Lingfei, a musical major student from the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, and Zheng Yunlong, who graduated from the Beijing Dance Academy and majored in musical performance, play the roles of Jekyll and Hyde. Referring to his role, Liu says: ""This is the most challenging role I've played because I sing 30 of the 32 songs. It feels like running a marathon.""

0,"An exhibition about the Austro-Hungarian queen is touring China. Wang Kaihao reports. Many Chinese who grew up in the 1970s and '80s are familiar with the name Sissi. That was how Queen Elisabeth (1837-98), a dual monarch of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, was commonly known, even among her subjects. The first film of a trilogy about the queen that was made in Austria, starring Romy Schneider, was shown in China in 1988, when Western films were still rare in Chinese cinemas. Sissi's real life is now being presented through an exhibition in Beijing, with nearly 150 cultural relics related to her or Hungary loaned from the Hungarian National Museum in Budapest. The exhibition,   in the 17th to 19th Centuries, will run through Jan 3 at the Palace Museum, also known as the Forbidden City. ""Her beauty, her romantic spirit and her tales are known to all,"" says Shan Jixiang, director of the Palace Museum. ""She sympathized with Hungary and was welcomed and loved by people there."" Sissi played a pivotal role in calming tensions between Hungarians and the ruling Habsburg family since she took the throne in the 1860s, he says. ""Queen Elisabeth is still a popular star in Hungary,"" says Benedek Vagra, director general of the Hungarian National Museum. ""Due to shared emotions in both countries (Hungary and China), she is a good example to give a brief introduction of Hungarian history to Chinese visitors."" Sissi had a difficult relationship with her mother-in-law, Emperor Franz Joseph I's mother. And she was emotionally detached from royal life at the Habsburg court. So, she spent much of her time living in Budapest and traveled all over Hungary. The queen also gave birth to her last child in Budapest. ""Actually, her real life and marriage were more difficult than what was depicted in the films,"" Vagra says.,  Beyond the queen's old photos, oil paintings, dresses and other daily items, the exhibition also provides a panoramic view of Hungarian aristocracy during her time through such displays as jewelry, dinnerware and religious items. Vagra points to a few highlighted exhibits. For example, a saddle made in the 18th century enabled women to ride horses sitting on one side. Sissi also used the saddle. ""I think the 'lady's saddle' is quite unique,"" he says. ""It was designed in that way because of the custom that women were demanded to sit 'properly' on horseback."" He also says the Hungarian aristocrats' costumes and armories reflect the country's history. A replica of the Holy Crown of Hungary, dating back to 1000 AD, is also on display. The item, made of silver gilt, pearl and cloisonne enamels, was used to prove the legitimacy of the monarchy in olden times. The original crown is displayed in the Hungarian Parliament and is heavily guarded. ""It's very important in Hungarian history－not only as a sign of royalty,"" Vagra says of the crown. ""Even though there is no king now, the crown expresses the spirit of a nation and holds the country together."" Hungarians, also known as Magyars, are thought to have first settled in today's Hungary in 896 after migrating from the East. According to one theory, they are descendants of Huns－the Eurasian nomadic people, who possibly had connections with the Xiongnu people from China.,  ""We are unique in Europe due to our Eastern origin,"" Vagra says. ""The exhibits this time like armories also show some Eastern characteristics."" Szonja Buslig, a cultural counselor at the Hungarian embassy in Beijing, says the exhibition at the Palace Museum reveals a part of the larger cultural cooperation between China and Hungary. In the Xiongnu city's ruins in Yulin in Northwest China's Shaanxi province, archaeologists from both countries are doing comparative studies on findings there with Hun relics unearthed in Hungary. Hungarian scholars also recently conducted field research in Shandan county, Gansu province, to look for more evidence of links. ""After a start from such a familiar topic (Sissi), we're planning another major cultural-relic exhibition in China,"" Buslig says. ""It will reveal how our ancestors migrated from the East."" She reveals that Hungary will participate in more projects in an upcoming museum on Xiongnu history in Yulin. Hungary became the first European country to sign a memorandum of understanding with China on June 6, 2016, on the Belt and Road Initiative.,  Buslig says the initiative will create opportunities for closer cultural ties between the two countries. Under the framework, Vagra says the rich history of Hungarian bronze wares will be shown in China. He adds that his museum also plans to introduce an exhibition on ancient Chinese civilization in Hungary, which he believes will easily strike an emotional chord in Budapest. The ongoing exhibition about Sissi was held in Shanghai before it came to Beijing in late September. It will move to Yunnan and Shaanxi provinces in January.

1,"BEIJING - Wang Xin is 33 years old. He is a landscape designer by profession and farmer in practice. The strawberries growing in his organic plantation on the southern outskirts of Beijing are believed among his clients to be ""the best in China"". Every day in the megacity of Beijing, when people his age are rushing among jammed commuter traffic, endless meetings and Power-Point slides like hamsters on a wheel, Wang lives a life in the countryside, far away from the urban crowd. He rises with the sun, works all day in the field or goes to the farmers' market to sell his fresh produce from the land that he has been working on, and by the end of the day, goes to bed as the night falls, with sore muscles and a heart that's content. ""I have hardly given it thought,"" he said when asked by a Xinhua News Agency reporter whether it was hard work. ""It has become a lifestyle. This is the life I choose to live."" Like Wang, in this country where people see food as a heavenly essence, many urbanites, mostly with a higher educational background and white-collar work experience, have chosen to return to the countryside, to dedicate their mind and strength to the pursuit of the freshest flavors and healthier nature. Every Tuesday, Saturday and Sunday, Wang Xin brings strawberries freshly picked the night before to Beijing's organic farmers' market. These fruits have grown naturally in nutrient-rich soil, without any use of fertilizers, pesticides, growth hormones or chemicals of any sort. ""I don't plan to be filthy rich, or I wouldn't have gone for organic farming,"" Wang said, laughing. He is a man of medium build, athletic, with a healthy tan. It is hard to relate him to a designer who used to spend days and nights in front of a computer screen. Having majored in landscape botany, Wang has always been a plant lover. At the age of 25, when he realized that he had been developing an office belly and his nine-to-five lifestyle had become a passionless routine, he quit his job, rented two plantation sheds in a suburb of the city, and rebooted his career as a farmer. Last week, Wang was able to present this winter's first batch of ripe fruits that he planted in September. The work had begun in July, when he prepared a mix of all-natural organic matter to enrich the soil. The formula has been perfected through years of research and experiments in collaboration with Beijing University of Agriculture, to simulate the formation of the fertile dark forest soil in Northeast China, known for its high crop productivity. Logically, the true foundation of organic farming lies in the soil content. If the soil is good, the outcome is safe and tasty without the need for any fertilizing chemicals, Wang pointed out. But quality produce is not the only objective. Wang hopes to build a production model that also rehabilitates the soil itself. In regular plantations, the soil usually would result in degradation within a matter of years after being overexploited. Wang's transition to the farm has not always been a smooth ride. But after a rough start, which he considers a valuable lesson learnt, he has gone back to the university and visited his colleagues in Tochigi Prefecture, Japan - known as the homeland of the Tochiotome strawberry variety - to study the most avant-garde technologies in the organic farming world. ""For organic farming to become truly sustainable, revitalizing the soil is key,"" concluded the nicknamed ""research peasant."" ""I am certain that in three to four years, the soil that I have been reviving will keep getting healthier and healthier,"" he said. Wang is not alone. In Alshaa, a semiarid region located in the northwestern Inner Mongolia autonomous region, Ma Yanwei, a master of science in ecology from Beijing Normal University, has spent years reinvigorating the salinized soils by applying water-saving methods to cultivate fruits and crops that are suitable for the local conditions. Sweet melon, for example, has become a best-selling produce of his farm Zhiliangtian. The smallholding was named in tribute to Zhi Liangzhi, the name for Chinese philosopher Wang Yangming's (1472-1529) belief in the innate conscience being the guiding principle of people's actions and their understanding of the outside world. Ma aims to find the ideal organic farming methodology to both maximize the utilization rate of the scarce local water resources and to revive the soil. ""As long as the soil improves, it is only natural to harvest healthy produce,"" Ma told a Xinhua reporter. In the last five to six years, Ma has seen more and more young people returning to the countryside to take on farming. In 2017, he set up a network for these ""new peasants"" to communicate, exchange their experiences and help each other, ""so we can avoid long detours and mistakes previously made by others,"" he said. ""If everyone does a good job, the land will only better recover,"" he said, when asked if his approach simply creates more competitors.,For 18 years, Zhang Zhimin, a former foreign trade expert with a State-owned group, has since been building an idyllic Eden in the far southwestern end of Beijing to produce foods and preserve biodiversity at the same time. Fluent in English, French and Spanish, Zhang worked in food imports and exports around the time when China opened its market to the world outside. She said she believes that ""agriculture is an art of humanity and nature working together."" At her bio-farm, nature rules over humanity's caprice. Instead of eliminating weeds and pests, the wholesome biosphere works by itself to produce seasonal harvests. ""Agriculture is the management of life, and life should be nourished by life itself,"" she said. It is the philosophy of her farm, called Heaven's Blessings, where trees, bushes and grass grow into inseparable woods, and insects, birds and cattle coexist in harmony. It's more like a habitat than a farm. Nature by itself is resistant to a variety of threats that can harm crops, she explained. In the face of pests, pollution and climate change, biodiversity makes the most effective defense. For example, a certain type of weed can produce a substance that fends off pests that are potentially harmful to crops. Earthworms, a populous resident at the farm, help to digest and transform fallen leaves into organic matter that fertilizes the plants, as well as to loosen the soil. ""Humanity's only job is to observe, comprehend and follow nature's rules to manage our lives,"" Zhang said. She explained that in early summer, she chops off the tender leaves and branches of the weed under the peach trees to feed the cattle, making room for the crops to thrive. In early autumn she lets the cows roam free to finish off the rest of the weeds. Similar results have been observed in Wang's other vegetable shed, where its natural ecosystem has worked out perfectly for the harvest to be healthy while no intervention from the outside is necessary, he said. ""I have observed that the grass that grows among the crops functions as a regulating factor of the microclimate by keeping the soil humid,"" he said. Then there are the whiteflies, hard to detect due to their miniscule size, they are usually controlled by insecticide. Here, the pest is kept in check by a native breed of spider that nests among the vegetables. ""Perhaps the wisdom based on thousands of years of working in harmony with nature could be the answer to the problems born in mass-scale modern agriculture,"" he suggested. Over 200 small farmers and scholars attended a Farmers' Assembly held in China Agricultural University's College of Humanities and Development. Participants came from all across the country, with the majority being highly educated with stable finances, who have returned to rural areas from city life, according to the organizers of the event - Beijing Organic Farmers' Market and Know Your Food, a self-publishing community focused on food sustainability. Beijing Organic Farmers' Market is a local platform for individuals or small-sized collectives who adhere to the principle of organic, eco-friendly and sustainable farming, food processing and art crafting. Since its launch in September 2010, it has become a regular event in the capital city and has taken place on more than 500 occasions. ""The Farmers' Market hopes to consolidate the mutual confidence between the small-holder peasants and consumers by establishing a participation guarantee system,"" said Chang Tianle, founder of the platform and also founding editor of Know Your Food. Through the system, the farmers, artisan bakers, jewelers and other craftspeople who wish to have a booth at the fair must respect and commit to the established criteria of organic production, under the inspection and approval of the market administrators and a committee of existing members, scholars and related NGOs. For the small-holder peasants and artisans, the Participation Guarantee System works where a third-party certification would be too heavy a burden to afford, while the consumers can rest assured of the organic nature of the products they purchase at the fair, said Chang. ""Going grocery shopping at the farmers' market, cooking at home and eating well, is a lifestyle of growing popularity,"" she said. ""Organic or ecological farming is an important measure to improve the quality and safety of agricultural products,"" said Meng Fanqiao, professor at CAU's College of Resources and Environmental Sciences. ""Organic or ecological farming is of vital significance for economic development as well as environmental protection in rural areas, for which it should play an imperative role in China's rural revitalization and the building of an ecological civilization,"" he noted. The green development of the countryside is a strategy that goes hand-in-hand with food supply security and income level improvement, said Jin Shuqin with the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs' Research Center for Rural Economy. ""Revivifying the ecosystem is a crucial aspect of overall rural revitalization,"" he said at the Peasants Assembly. ""It is our hope to promote healthy eating to become the mainstream choice, as well as the organic way to produce healthy foods,"" said Ma Xiaochao, project officer with Know Your Food. ""In the future, a healthy food-centered community will be built together by our small peasant friends, consumers, trade platforms, environmental NGOs and R & D institutes,"" she predicted. Xinhua"

1,"China and the United States should take measures to ensure that the internet unites rather than divides the two countries and refrain from ""arms race"" in the cyberspace, according to scholars and experts attending a forum during the 4th World Internet Conference.

0,"BEIJING/SHANGHAI - Chinese police are investigating claims of sexual molestation and needlemarks on children at a Beijing kindergarten run by RYB Education Inc, the latest case in a booming childcare industry to spark outrage among parents, sending the company's New York-listed shares tumbling on Friday.  The official Xinhua news agency said late on Thursday that police were checking allegations that some teachers and staff at the kindergarten had abused children, who were ""reportedly sexually molested, pierced by needles and given unidentified pills"".  Shares in RYB plunged 38 percent on the New York Stock Exchange early on Friday, almost wiping out most of the 44 percent rise in the Chinese company's stock since its IPO in September.  Parents said their children, some as young as three, relayed troubling accounts of a naked adult male conducting purported ""medical check-ups"" on students, who were also unclothed, other media said.  Some parents, who gathered outside the school to demand answers on Thursday, said their children gave matching accounts of being fed unidentified tablets and of punishments where students were ""made to stand"" naked in class, media said.  The welfare of children in professional care has become a hot-button issue in China, where a string of high-profile cases of abuse has underlined lax regulations and supervision in the childcare and early learning industry.  ""We deeply apologise for the serious anxiety this matter has brought to parents and society,"" RYB said in a statement on its official microblog on Friday, adding that it was helping authorities.  ""We are currently working with the police to provide relevant surveillance materials and equipment; the teachers in question have been suspended and we are co-operating with the police investigation,"" it said.  The school's principal had lodged a police report against ""individuals who have engaged in false accusations and framing"", it said, without elaborating.  Beijing police did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment.  In a statement before its shares opened trade on Friday, RYB said it was planning a $50 million share buy-back programme and had established a special task force led by independent company directors to do a ""thorough self-inspection across all teaching facilities"".  China's education ministry has begun a special investigation into the operation of kindergartens, it said in a statement on Thursday, and told education departments nationwide to ""take warning from these types of incidents"".  Separate incidents in China of children being slapped, beaten with a stick and having their mouths sealed shut with duct tape have also gone viral and fuelled anger online.  News of the investigation into the Beijing kindergarten triggered a wave of outrage on social media, with more than 76 million mentions of ""RYB"" on Tencent Holdings Ltd's WeChat messaging service on Thursday.  ""These may be individual cases but the deeper problems they reflect cannot be overlooked,"" a Xinhua editorial said. ""Laws must be enforced, supervision strengthened, teacher wages increased. The childcare industry cannot be allowed to grow in an uncivilised fashion.""  Chinese education providers have been attracting major investment, while others have sought global listings, latching onto fast-growing demand from parents for high-end education services.  Before Friday, shares in RYB had been up about 44 percent since a September New York listing, giving it a market value of nearly $766 million.  This was not the first case of alleged abuse at an RYB school.  In 2015, a court in Jilin province found two teachers guilty of physically abusing children at one of its kindergartens in the city of Siping. In that case, staff at the school on ""multiple occasions used needles and intimidation tactics to abuse many of the children under their care"", according to the court ruling document.  Earlier this year, RYB said it had found ""serious mistakes"" at another one of its Beijing schools and had asked the principal to step down after videos emerged showing teachers hitting and pushing children.  State television broadcast images of police and angry parents gathered outside the school in Beijing on Thursday, calling for answers.  On Friday, one father leaving the school said he had been there to cancel his son's enrolment and demand a refund.  Another parent, 36-year-old Wang Siqi, said she took the day off work to demand answers, even though her six-year-old son does not attend the school.  ""As a mother when I saw this news I really couldn't take it,"" she said. ""This is unforgivable.""  RYB says on its website it runs a network of more than 1,300 directly owned and franchised play-and-learn centres and nearly 500 kindergartens for children up to age six in about 300 Chinese cities and towns."
1,"African experts are confident that the China International Import Expo in Shanghai will deepen international business cooperation and address the trade imbalance between China and its trade partners. Cavince Adhere, a scholar specializing in China-Africa relations, said the expo thrusts China toward a new frontier for goods and services around the world. However, while the expo has been deemed a significant move by China to embrace foreign products and services, Adhere said the big question in many African capitals is how the continent will make the best use of the opportunity. The low volume of African exports to China has been a concern for a long time, and the depth and complexity of China's economy make it difficult for many African countries to compete, he said, resulting in African countries exporting more raw products to Beijing and importing high value-added products in return. ""The expo is therefore a good opportunity for China and Africa to explore what is working and how best to harness the existing potential toward win-win trade relations,"" he said, adding that data from various sources indicate that African exports to China have been on an upward trend. For successful results, Adhere said, both parties need progressive economic partnerships that can facilitate African exports to the Chinese market. He said there is need to diversify the type of African products that China welcomes into its markets－from traditional crude oil, copper, iron and rare minerals to products like flowers, vegetables and beverages. ""Africa should also aggressively market new sources of comparative advantage, such as tourism to the Chinese market. The continent should also leverage the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation to further buoy its exports to China,"" Adhere said. Enock Twinoburyo, an economist based in Rwanda's capital, Kigali, said that China's opening of its market is a starting gesture in a world where international trade is on a downward trend. ""In the regime of the emerging trade wars, the China import expo may be an avenue to bring order to international trade. The need for nonprohibitive regimes remains warranted,"" he said. Twinoburyo believes that China has always had a generous import regime for African countries, and an open market policy could be an effective way to restore the trade balance between Africa and the world, as well as with China in the long term. He said that over the long term, Africa's share of international trade has remained between 2 and 3 percent and that the continent's competitiveness needs to be supported by structural transformations, from production of raw products to added value. Richard Lebero, a trade and investment policy expert based in Kigali, said that as he looks at the Chinese expo from an African perspective, he sees China reemphasizing its open trade policy for all countries."
0,"The Beijing Book Building opened to the public on May 8, 1998, as seen in the item from China Daily. It was the country's largest book retailer at that time with a floor area of 50,000 square meters. One year later, the bookstore opened an online shop, with a growing number of people turning to tablets or smartphones for information. It was one of the country's first brick-and-mortar bookshops to go online. In 2017, it launched automatic bookselling machines. With technology, such as artificial intelligence and the internet, the bookstore provides readers with a brand-new environment. Like the Beijing Book Building, physical bookstores have changed their business models and operations to attract readers. The latest survey on reading habits from the Chinese Academy of Press and Publication showed nearly 81 percent of adult respondents read digitally, including online, mobile, digital readers and tablets, last year, while the proportion was less than 25 percent in 2009. The survey found that Chinese adults on average read 7.99 books last year, including 3.32 digital copies, while younger people, ages up to 17, read 8.91 books, a slight increase from the previous year. In recent years, digital reading has grown steadily across the country, according to the academy. The annual Government Work Report in March referred to ""championing a culture of reading"" for the sixth year since 2014. There were 225,000 bookstores and sales outlets in the country by the end of last year, up by 4.3 percent over 2017.

0,"An increasing number of senior middle school students in Beijing are traveling abroad to take SAT and ACT tests in order to apply for US colleges, spawning a booming business activity, Beijing Youth Daily reports. Many US colleges look at applicants' SAT (Scholastic Assessment Test) and ACT (American College Test) scores as an important reference for enrollment, but the tests are largely unavailable on the Chinese mainland. Chinese students have to travel to Hong Kong, Macao or Taiwan, or neighboring countries such as Japan, South Korea, Thailand and Singapore to take the tests. Hong Kong's AsiaWorld-Expo is the most popular thus far due to its proximity to the Chinese mainland and lower costs. The paper said most attendees take the tests at least three times to get ideal scores, each trip costing a minimum of 5,000 to 8,000 yuan ($735 to $1,176). Eager to seize a share of the market -- which is huge, lucrative and still expanding -- travel agencies, educational institutions, including some public schools, are all organizing group tours for the tests. ""The tests resemble the Chinese college entrance exam in that only high scores can secure a good school,"" said a student surnamed Zhao from the prestigious Beijing No. 8 Middle School. Students at the school's international department estimated that about 10 percent of graduates went abroad to further their studies each year. So far, the number of international schools in Beijing has topped 85, and at least 15 public schools have international departments or classes especially designed for students who plan to study abroad. Beijing National Day School, a renowned school, runs study-abroad classes at its main campus alongside an international department, and more than 30 percent of the students go abroad after graduation. A teacher surnamed Yan at the international department said students applying for US colleges took up more than 85 percent of the total number of applicants each season. The schools organize SAT test tours for their own students through cooperation with travel agencies, and parents prefer them to others due to security considerations. The price usually ranges from 5,200 to 5,700 yuan. Tours offered by various other educational institutions cover hotel, air ticket, pre-test tutoring and signing up for the tests. A four-day trip to Hong Kong costs 5,000 to 6,000 yuan, while trips to Singapore, Japan and South Korea cost around 8,000 yuan."
1,"US architecture and infrastructure consulting company AECOM said it expects a bright future in the Chinese market as it foresees a profound need for high-quality services amid the country's further urbanization and development. ""China has entered a phase of increasing expansion in consumption and imports,"" said Sean Chiao, president of AECOM Asia-Pacific. He predicted $10 trillion of goods and services will be imported to China in the next five years. ""The China International Import Expo signals that China's opening-up strategy has switched its focus from high speed to high quality, and we believe the demand for premium services in infrastructure will soon emerge in the Chinese market,"" Chiao said. ""AECOM feels deeply honored to participate in the CIIE. We are very much inspired by President Xi Jinping's speech, in which he said, 'The Chinese economy is a sea, not a pond. Storms can overturn a pond, but never a sea'."" Chiao added that ""AECOM aims to make the world a better place to live. In many strategic development plans, such as the Belt and Road Initiative, the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and the Yangtze River Delta, we have made our contribution. This showcases that AECOM's determination has never changed in the more than four decades we have participated in China's development."" According to a report from the Ministry of Commerce, released during the recent CIIE, China ranked No 2 for the volume of imported services in 2017. The report said total service imports could reach $2.5 trillion over the next five years. Another service provider, Messe Frankfurt, one of the world's largest trade fair organizers, said it also eyes great potential in China. Stephan Buurma, a management board member of Messe Frankfurt Group, said China has always been and will continue to be a market of vitality for trade, especially after the CIIE. The company also said it hopes to introduce more high-end industrial and trade fairs in China in the future. ""We started from one show a year 31 years ago, to constantly adding more, with 35 shows a year now,"" Buurma said. He added the company has reported a strong performance because the Chinese industry and economy is growing－not only are more Chinese companies going abroad to attend trade shows, but more international fairs are coming to China."
1,"Beijing will take new measures to control the number of cars without local licenses on roads to ease traffic and reduce pollution, the local government announced on Friday. Starting on Nov 1 next year, cars not licensed by Beijing will have only 12 permits a year to enter the city, with each permit effective for seven days. Under the policy, non-Beijing cars can only be driven in the city for a total of 84 days a year, and they must be parked in residential parking lots the rest of the time. ""There have been too many cars with non-Beijing licenses on the roads in recent years, which has made traffic worse,"" said Ding Zhe, 42, a local resident who now takes the subway to work, even though he owns a car with Beijing plates, because of traffic congestion. Beijing had 5.97 million locally registered cars as of April, according to the Beijing Commission of Transport. However, there are constantly more than 700,000 non-Beijing-registered cars in use in the downtown areas－the number of all the cars in Hong Kong. The government aims to cap the number of locally registered cars at below 6.3 million by the end of 2020. The city has also made more efforts to improve public transportation. It has 22 subway lines with a combined length of 602 kilometers. An additional 397 km of subway lines are planned by 2021. Beijing adopted a lottery policy in 2010 to curb the rising number of new cars in the city. Under the policy, a person must win a license through a lottery before buying a new car. Because of the limited number of plates in the lottery system, many residents began registering their new cars in other cities. Car dealers also provide the service to help buyers obtain a non-Beijing license at a fee of about 4,500 yuan ($700). Car owners only need to put a record online to get permission on a weekly basis to drive in the city, although there are a few restrictions, including not being allowed to drive in some central areas. In 2015, the authority gave out 50,000 permits each day. In 2016, the number soared to 100,000 a day. Since 2017, the authority has given out 725,000 permits each week. ""Giving such a permission is to allow non-Beijing residents to drive to Beijing on business or leisure purposes. Driving a non-Beijing-licensed car permanently in the city has abused the lottery policy,"" said Zhang Rui, an associate professor of city planning at Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture. ""Even though there is strong demand for cars, city policymakers still have to put social fairness as a priority to ensure the effectiveness of existing regulations,"" she said. Yuan Maocun, a transportation specialist at the Ministry of Transport, said Beijing's limited resources and capacity have made it necessary to control car numbers. ""The new policy has given people 17 months to deal with their cars,"" Yuan said. Su Lei, 30, an engineer in Beijing, said he had his car licensed outside of Beijing three years ago. ""I seldom drive to downtown. I both live and work in the suburbs,"" he said. ""If I cannot drive it every day, I have to use friends' cars, because public transportation is not very convenient in the suburbs."" He has been in the lottery for six years, but has not yet been lucky enough to get a Beijing license plate."

The first model, CR400AF, will depart from the Beijing South Railway Station at 11:05 am and travel towards Shanghai, and the second model, CR400BF, will leave the Shanghai Hongqiao Railway Station for Beijing at the same time. The information was released by the China Railway Corp, the State-owned rail operator.  The Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway has become the nation's busiest high-speed rail link, with an average of about 505,000 passenger trips taken each day. Lu Dongfu, general manager of China Railway Corp, announced the new trains would be called "" "", otherwise known as ""Rejuvenation"" in English. He released this information at a naming ceremony in Beijing's Daxing district on Sunday. He said the word rejuvenation has been widely employed by the Chinese government, referring to the goal of achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Prior to the latest models, all of the country's bullet trains were labeled with the word ""Harmony"" on the exterior of each model. Lu added the new train models were mainly developed based on China's railway standards and technologies, and were designed to be better adapted to China's environment and rail transport patterns. According to designers at the China Academy of Railway Sciences, the models would travel at a speed of about 350 kilometers per hour; however, the maximum speed of each model will be 400 kph."

0,"Many cultural relics of the Palace Museum－China's former imperial palace in Beijing, which is also known as the Forbidden City－and some ancient books in the collection of the National Library of China are in the two institutions due to the efforts of Zheng Zhenduo (1898-1958). Zheng, a pioneer in cultural-relic protection in New China, was honored by the museum and library in Beijing on Wednesday. The day marked the 120th anniversary of his birth. Zheng was the first director of the National Cultural Heritage Administration after 1949. When he took the position, the country had just started reconstruction after the civil war. Zheng immediately began his endeavor to bring some lost treasures home. Boyuan Tie (letter to Boyuan) and Zhongqiu Tie (letter about Mid-Autumn Festival)－top calligraphy works from the fourth century－were once beloved by emperor Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). But they were lost after the monarchy fell. Zheng's coordination enabled their return from Hong Kong to the Chinese mainland for 350,000 HK dollars in 1950. Zheng also persuaded art guru Zhang Daqian to sell Night Revels of Han Xizai, a 10th-century scroll painting, from his private collection to the country's cultural institutions at ""a low price"".,All three artworks are now among top artifacts housed at the Palace Museum. Zheng's contributions went beyond. ""He has left abundant legacies for us to consolidate cultural relic-related work today,"" Shan Jixiang, director of the Palace Museum, said at the memorial seminar. ""He pushed for a legal system to protect the cultural relics. He started training others to protect them. Many of his theories still guide our everyday work."" Zheng opened the first training class in New China on ancient-book restoration in the 1950s. He wanted the Palace Museum to do more than just collect royal artifacts, by building a comprehensive collection of different artworks and educating museum visitors about the history of cultural relics. ""These ideas were pioneering in his time,"" says Gu Yucai, deputy director of the National Cultural Heritage Administration. ""We are working on them today."" During the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression (1931-1945), he saved many ancient books to prevent them from being lost. Zheng got into debt buying some 600 ancient pottery figurines in 1947 and '48, during the civil war. However, he donated all the figurines to the country's cultural institutions after taking his official position at the heritage administration. Many of the figurines are regularly displayed in the sculpture gallery of the Palace Museum. And after his death, Zheng's wife donated some 7,000 copies of ancient books to the National Library of China, following his will. Some items from this donation are displayed at an exhibition that opened on Wednesday at the same library as a tribute to him. A catalog of his ancient book collection was also published on the same day for academic studies. ""The exhibition is not only to show Zheng's marvelous collection,"" says Zhang Zhiqing, deputy director of the national library, ""but also to remind people of his legacy."" Zheng advocated that archaeologists and relics researchers should not collect or buy antiques as personal belongings. In 1997, this idea was listed by the National Cultural Heritage Administration among professional ethics for workers in the field of cultural relics. Born in Wenzhou, Zhejiang province, Zheng once taught in top higher-education institutions, such as Yenching University (now part of Peking University) and Tsinghua University in Beijing, and Fudan University in Shanghai. He also worked on history, traditional Chinese folklore and literature. As a translator, he introduced Indian Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore's Stray Birds in China, and did many comparative studies between Chinese and Western cultures. Zheng died in a plane crash in 1958."
1,"As the 2017 China-Russia Forum: New Media-Youth Collaboration approaches, five university students are in Russia to work with 11 young partners there to prepare for the event. Recruitment of the five took a month, including a thorough selection and interview process of applicants from more than 20 universities nationwide. The five selected－Wei Danyang, Peking University; Lan Juxin, Communication University of China; Wu Yuhong, Jinan University; Jiang Jie, Guangdong University of Foreign Studies; and Zhao Zijian, Tianjin Normal University－finally stood out. A farewell meeting for them was held last week in Beijing, and they visited China Daily and spoke with journalists before departing. Han Lei, editor-in-chief of chinadaily.com.cn, attended the farewell meeting and expressed her hopes and wishes for the student delegation. The five students traveled to Rostov-on-Don on Friday and started eight days of activities beginning in the port city and regional administrative center. The visit is led by Li Jun, deputy editor-in-chief of chinadaily.com.cn, and Professor Wu Fei of the School of Journalism and Communication at Jinan University.

0,"Authorities in Beijing have released an ambitious plan for reducing days with heavy air pollution by 2020－at least 25 percent from 2015 levels－by increasing green transportation and curbing kicked-up dust. While generally lauding the plan, which is tailor-made for the capital based on its major air polluting sources, experts warned of the difficulties of achieving further air quality improvements in the city because of the change in major pollution contributors to more challenging types. The capital plans to reduce the average concentration of PM 2.5 particulate matter, which poses health dangers, in its urban areas to 52 micrograms per cubic meter by 2020. In 2017, the average PM2.5 density citywide stood at 58 mg per cu meter. Beijing had 46 days with heavy air pollution in 2015. To achieve the goals, authorities plan to increase the amount of cargo moved by trains to 10 percent of the total from the current 2.9 percent, and to more than double the number of new energy vehicles to 400,000. The capital also vows to enhance law enforcement against polluting diesel-powered trucks and to inspect at least 1.5 million of them every year. Liu Ying, an expert at the Beijing Transport Institute, said road transportation currently accounts for more than 80 percent of the cargo in the capital, and the current proportion of cargo transported by train is similar to that in major cities around the world. She said, however, that it's possible for the city to shift the transportation of some goods to rail, including new vehicles, construction material, steel and daily necessities. ""The shift from diesel-powered trucks to electric railways with almost zero release of pollutants will achieve remarkable results in reducing air pollutant discharges in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region,"" she said. Internal combustion engines contributed the largest amount－45 percent－of the locally generated PM2.5 in Beijing. Though diesel engines account for just 4 percent of the total engines in use, they contribute to 90 percent of air pollutants produced by engines, according to Shi Aijun, deputy head of Beijing Municipal Research Institute of Environmental Protection. The diesel engines are not all associated with vehicles, as other equipment may also use such engines. Wang Shuxiao, professor of environmental studies at Tsinghua University, said the plan was drafted in accordance with the major air pollution contributors in the capital. According to an analysis of pollution sources by Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau last year, kicked-up dust contributed 16 percent to PM2.5 density, second only to engines. The capital also plans to reduce kicked-up dust by more than 30 percent by the end of 2020 from that of 2017. ""It has become more and more difficult to further improve air quality in Beijing,"" Wang said. The contribution of polluting sources that are relatively easy to control, including factories and coal burning, has decreased, while the contribution from lifestyle-related and mobile sources has increased, she said."
1,"1. Duel-credit policy to tackle emissions China issued a dual-credit policy in late September in an effort to cut gasoline fuel consumption and stimulate the development of new energy cars, including electric cars and plug-in hybrids. In 2019, automakers in China must gain credits for new energy cars equivalent to 10 percent of all its cars, with one vehicle generating multiple credits. The quota will rise to 12 percent in 2020. If they cannot meet the goal, they can either purchase credits from other carmakers or face a fine. The policy has prompted many international brands, including Volkswagen and Ford, to launch new joint ventures with local Chinese carmakers.,10. Loan policies revised to spur e-car buyers New loan policies for car purchases were issued in November, allowing buyers of new energy vehicles to borrow a larger portion of the purchase price. Starting in 2018, electric car buyers can borrow up to 85 percent of the cost from banks, according to the People's Bank of China and the China Banking Regulatory Commission. The maximum loan for cars using traditional fuel is set at 80 percent. The purchase of fossil-fuel cars and electric vehicles for commercial use will enjoy lower loan ratios of 70 percent and 75 percent, respectively.,2. VW signs 3rd local joint venture Volkswagen became the first international brand to have three passenger car joint ventures in China when the German automaker signed a deal with Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Co in June. The 50-50 partnership, which is dedicated to developing and producing electric cars, will see a total investment of 6 billion yuan ($882 million). Its first model, which will be produced at existing JAC facilities, is expected to roll off the assembly line in 2018. That would give VW a head start to become the first localized electric car producer in the country, ahead of its rivals such as General Motors.,3. Report: The future is clean and clever China is set to build a globally competitive automotive industry within 10 years, with new energy vehicles and smart, internet-connected cars taking the lead worldwide, according to an industry guideline released in April. Among other goals, the guideline expects sales of electric, plug-in hybrids and fuel cell cars in the nation to reach 2 million by 2020, and such cars are to account for 20 percent of all auto sales by 2025. Half of new cars in China will feature some driving assistance and low-level autonomous driving functions by 2020, and the number is expected to rise to 80 percent in 2025.,4. Beijing roads open to autonomous tests Local authorities in Beijing released China's first guideline on road tests of autonomous motor vehicles in December, signaling the country's determination to accelerate the development of the technology. The guideline, compiled by the city's transport commission, public security bureau, and economy and information technology commission, applies to independent entities registered in China. They can apply to test at most five vehicles at a time, but before conducting road tests they must first complete tests in designated closed zones, according to the guideline. Many Chinese companies, both carmakers and IT giants, are already working hard on the research and development of autonomous driving technology.,5. Tesla to build in Shanghai by 2020 Tesla Inc announced plans to produce cars in China by around 2020. The carmaker's CEO Elon Musk said in November that Tesla is about three years away from starting production in China and will not make any significant capital expenditure until 2019. Tesla confirmed in late October to China Daily that it was in talks with the Shanghai city government to build a plant. Musk said the new plant will make cars for China and other parts of Asia, essentially the smaller and cheaper Model 3 sedan and the upcoming Model Y crossover. It will not make the more expensive Model S sedan or Model X SUV in China.,6. FAW, Dongfeng, Changan join hands Three State-owned Chinese automakers have joined hands to better brace themselves for the market. According to a deal signed in December, FAW Group Corp, Dongfeng Motor Corp and Chongqing Changan Automobile Co are to promote technological innovation, optimize full-value chain operations, expand their global markets and explore new business models. The three companies will build a technology center that will focus primarily on new energy cars, smart and internet-connected cars as well as lightweight car bodies, and also share the results. The cooperation will help Chinese carmakers to gain considerable scale, and build better and more competitive car brands, Changan said in a statement.,7. Geely goes on global spending spree Zhejiang Geely Holding Co has expanded its global presence after a number of overseas acquisition deals in 2017. Its shopping spree started in June, when it signed a final contract with DRB-Hicom Berhad, acquiring a 49.9 percent stake in the Malaysian company's Proton and 51 percent shares of its sports car brand Lotus. In November, Geely moved to acquire United States startup Terrafugia, which specializes in flying cars. The Chinese carmaker ended its year with a deal to acquire an 8.2 percent stake and 15.6 percent voting rights in AB Volvo, the Swedish manufacturer of trucks, buses, construction equipment and engines. It had acquired Volvo's passenger car unit in 2010.,8. Purchase tax cut can't halt slow down China's auto market growth is set to slow to a six-year low this year, despite a 25 percent purchase tax cut on smaller car models. Industrial experts predicted the market's total new vehicle sales volume will reach 29 million units by the end of 2017, for an annual growth rate of 3.5 percent year-on-year. The purchase tax cut was revised in 2016 to 25 percent on cars with 1.6-liter and smaller engines in 2017, from the previous 50 percent tax cut, to prevent a hard landing of the new car market.,9. Sales of fossil fuel vehicles could cease Xin Guobin, China's vice-minister of industry and information technology, said in September the government had started considering a timetable to phase out the manufacturing and sales of fossil-fuel powered cars, without giving details on the time frame. The statement followed similar moves by several countries to end the era of fossil fuel-powered vehicles, aiming to cut carbon emissions and reduce pollution by banning the sales of solely fossil fuel vehicles. In November, China halted sales of diesel with sulphur content above 10 parts per million to address air pollution. The Fuzhou city government released a plan to replace all fossil fuel buses in the city with new energy vehicles by 2020."

""The country does in 60 seconds (online) what some would only do over a day, week, or more,"" said Tech in Asia, a popular technology website which compiled the data. What is more important, the blossoming trend has unfolded just in few years, as the cyberspace gets increasingly intertwined with the offline world, officials and experts said. China officially launched the Internet Plus initiative in 2015, which was designed to upgrade traditional industries by embracing new technologies such as mobile internet, cloud computing, big data, and the internet of things. In just two years, concrete progress has been made, with internet-related technologies revolutionizing sectors such as manufacturing, retail, transportation, finance, and healthcare. ""We will work faster to build China into a manufacturer of quality and develop advanced manufacturing, promote further integration of the internet, big data, and artificial intelligence with the real economy,"" said President Xi Jinping in the report he delivered at the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. Since the inception of the Internet Plus, new industries and business models have emerged, which have greatly boosted China's economic growth, according to Premier Li Keqiang. AliResearch, a research institute of Alibaba, noted that internet-related growth has accounted for 6.9 percent of China's gross domestic product, the second highest proportion in the world. The fast application of new digital technologies in traditional sectors has been enabled largely by China's powerful information infrastructure. The country has built the world's largest broadband network. Thanks to the quick deployment of 4G mobile technologies and fiber-optic networks, the world's second-largest economy has also accumulated about 751 million netizens as of June this year, roughly equivalent to those of the United States and India combined, data from the China Internet Network Information Center show. In comparison, the number for June, 2012 in China was just 538 million, reflecting the stellar growth the country has made in the past five years. Miao Wei, the minister of Industry and Information Technology, said China has risen to be a strong player in the global internet arena, and become the largest manufacturing powerhouse in the world. ""Upgrading the manufacturing sector with advanced digital technologies is a global trend. China has already made a good start in this direction,"" he said. The ministry has handpicked 206 smart manufacturing pilot projects across the country since 2015. Twenty-eight of them are rolling out industrial internet trials, which have boosted their production efficiency by more than 30 percent. By establishing a computerized interconnection of machinery, big data and the internet of things which can analyze data from machinery and adjust its operation, companies are accelerating their push to upgrade plants. Zhang Ruimin, chairman of Haier Group, a household appliances giant, said traditional enterprises have been completely overhauled in the internet age. The company has built an industrial cloud platform, which helps it swiftly satisfy customers personalized demands on a large scale. As for businesses which used to be hit by the prevalence of internet technologies, positive changes are also showing up to inject new vitality. Brick-and-mortar stores, for instance, are starting to benefit from e-commerce behemoth Alibaba and JD.com Inc's efforts to develop the so-called new retail experience. They are scrambling to help brands merge online and offline resources to offer customers a seamless shopping experience with the aid of artificial intelligence, big data and cloud computing technologies. To be more specific, tech gurus are converting retail outlets into ""intelligent stores"" that have drawn thousands of labels, from Nike to Shiseido to Wyeth. Through an interconnected system, they allow shoppers to track product availability at other locations in real time and get timely delivery to their doorsteps while choosing to pay with their phones. Danielle Bailey, Asia-Pacific research head at consultancy L2, said the integration of virtual and physical landscapes is an area where China leads the way. ""In the West you have this battle of online and offline ... Here through a variety of models you see where China has already had these things work, and not just empty talk,"" she said. Likewise, how to embrace the internet is also the latest buzz word echoing around the finance sector. In addition to offering mobile payment services, local financial technology companies are actively embracing new activities such as online wealth management, credit scoring and utility bill payments. Such robust development has helped China secure five of the top 10 places in a ranking of the world's best-performing fintech players, according to a report released by UK-based advisory firm KPMG and Australian investment company H2 Ventures. Alibaba's affiliate Ant Financial, which runs China's largest mobile finance platform Alipay, remains the most successful global fintech company, said the report which was unveiled in November. ""China continues to dominate the fintech landscape,"" said H2 Ventures partner Ben Heap. ""These firms are continuing a trend that is several years in the making and highlights the extraordinary rise of the fintech industry in China."" Girish Ramachandran, Asia-Pacific president of Tata Consultancy Services, India's largest information technology company, said China's rapid strides in the integration of internet and finance have directly inspired India to digitize its economy. For example, Ant Financial has brought its wireless payment solutions to its Indian counterpart Paytm.com, and the two signed an agreement in 2015 to create a local version of Alipay. Meanwhile, the Internet Plus strategy is spawning a tide of innovation in China, helping the country to evolve from an ""innovation sponge"", absorbing and adapting existing technology and knowledge from around the world, into a global leader in innovation, spawning a wide range of homegrown cutting-edge products and services. Nothing better demonstrates this than the bike-sharing phenomenon. Created by Chinese players, including Ofo and Mobike, GPS-enabled, dockless bikes are now improving the lives of people in big cities at home and abroad who are fed up with congested roads and long for zero-emissions forms of transportation. Mobike announced in November that it would start operations in Berlin, Germany, meeting the company's ambitious goal of expanding to 200 cities globally by the end of this year. ""In stark contrast to the previous generation of Chinese internet companies that are focused on domestic growth until the market became saturated, emerging startups are better at coming up with their own ideas and better aware of the opportunities abroad,"" said Zhang Xu, an independent smart transportation analyst in Beijing."
0,"China has been inspecting cram schools nationwide to ensure those that do not meet government standards make the necessary changes by year-end, the Ministry of Education said on Thursday. As of Wednesday, more than 400,000 cram schools had been checked, Lyu Yugang, director of the ministry's Basic Education Department, said at a news conference in Beijing. Inspectors have found 273,000 crams schools that fail to the make the grade, and 248,000 have had their programs changed to come into line with government standards, Lyu said. Beijing's education, civil affairs, human resources and social security, and market regulation authorities have inspected more than 12,600 cram schools, and 93 percent of those found with problems have made necessary changes, said Feng Hongrong, deputy inspector of the Beijing Education Commission. Once all the changes are made, the capital will carry out a second round of inspections in January to ensure schools stick with them, he said. In February, the Ministry of Education and three other ministries issued guidelines to regulate providers of after-school classes. ""Teachers who lure or coerce students into attending after-school training classes will be dealt with seriously, or even stripped of their teaching credentials,"" the guidelines said. They also said that institutions should not teach anything outside the syllabus, and they should submit course plans, enrollment targets and class hours to local authorities for approval. After-school classes are not allowed to organize graded examinations or conduct competitions for primary and secondary school students. In addition, the training results from these institutions cannot be used as criteria for future enrollment in primary or secondary schools, the guidelines added. The State Council's General Office issued a guideline to regulate cram schools in August aimed at easing the heavy workload on primary and secondary school students. It highlighted behavior such as teaching students more advanced materials than appropriate for their grade in core subjects, such as Mandarin and mathematics. Institutions should also not teach ahead of students’ school schedules, or assign homework and give graded tests for work beyond their grade level. Certificates and licenses for cram schools will be reviewed annually, and local governments will publish online lists of qualified institutions and of those that failed to meet the standards, the State Council’s guideline added."
1,"Xiongan New Area will control the use of land by developing up to 30 percent of its area in the long run, leaving the rest for green space and water landscapes, the State Council said on Wednesday. The new area should create an inviting, ecologically healthy environment, and stronger efforts should be made to better manage and environmentally restore Baiyang Lake in Hebei province. Procedures should be developed to replenish the lake's water and recover acreage that has been lost over the years. Rural pollution should be effectively constrained to ensure that the lake's water quality meets national standards. A national park will be built for the lake in the long term, and a large number of trees will be planted in the area. Air quality should be substantially improved so that the new area will have blue skies, green space and clean water. These goals for the new area were listed in the 14-clause overall plan (2018-35) that has been approved by the central government and was disclosed on Wednesday. The national new area, covering land of Xiongxian, Rongcheng and Anxin counties and neighboring areas between Beijing and Baoding in Hebei, was established in April 2017. Ultimately, the area will have 2,000 square kilometers of land. By the end of June 2017, the number of permanent residents of the area reached 1.04 million, and it is designed to accommodate 2 million to 2.5 million people in the future. The boundary of urban development should be strictly regulated in Xiongan, with strong protection of permanent farmlands and taking the lakes and ponds, forests, farmland and grassland as a whole ecosystem, the document said. It said Xiongan will undertake non-capital functions from Beijing in an orderly way, focusing on universities, research institutes, medical institutions, corporate headquarters, financial institutions, and public institutions. Infrastructure and public services should be improved along with the local business environment. The document aims for coordinating the development of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei, with Xiongan to be built as one of the ""two wings"" of Beijing, along with Tongzhou district, where the Beijing municipal government is now located. The new area and the city of Zhangjiakou should be promoted as two driving engines for Hebei, seizing the opportunity of the 2022 Winter Olympic Games, which will be co-hosted by Beijing and Zhangjiakou. Hebei should perform its duties in promoting all work in Xiongan with every inch of land being cautiously planned before construction, the document added."
0,"Ablajan Muhtar, owner of an auto repair factory in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, could choose to fly to Beijing in three hours. Instead, he has begun a three-month journey on foot for a benevolent cause. The 43-year-old started his trek in the regional capital of Urumqi on April 8, and is planning to arrive in Beijing this month. Muhtar is hoping to raise more than 200,000 yuan ($29,000) to be donated to 10 schools in Xinjiang to help them build soccer fields and purchase equipment for students and soccer coaches. ""In addition to collecting donations, I have another mission－spreading the good virtues of local people during my journey to Beijing. I want people across China to learn about the generosity, hospitality, tolerance and sense of unity that people in Xinjiang possess,"" he said. Inspired by the well-known national legend of 75-year-old Uncle Qurban, who ventured from the region to Beijing in 1956 on the back of a mule to meet Chairman Mao, Muhtar decided at the beginning of this year to make the same journey. He spent three months preparing for his trip. ""This is my Chinese dream. I will overcome all the obstacles I face to accomplish my dream."" Completing the 3,282-kilometer journey on foot will not be easy. The route will see him pass through numerous different environments and spans five administrative areas from Xinjiang in Northwest China to Gansu province, and then on to the Inner Mongolia autonomous region and Hebei province in North China before reaching Beijing. According to the design of the route, Muhtar must pass through a more than 100-km section of desert and an unpopulated area of more than several hundred square meters, as well as climb over the Qinling Mountains in Central China. For most of the journey, he must live in a tent that he will carry in his 1-meter-tall backpack. Bokram Elyashanbaba, a photographer and friend of Muhtar, said the journey will push him to his limits and is of important significance because of the connection to Uncle Qurban. ""We need to witness another exemplary deed in our time. I have full confidence in Muhtar to accomplish his dream,"" Elyashanbaba said. Muhtar's wife, Patima Mamat, said she fully supports the endeavor. ""My husband has always loved hiking. When he talked to me about his first hiking experience from Urumqi to Atux in Xinjiang, I felt a mixture of happiness and concern for him,"" Mamat said. ""When he told me he will make 100 new friends during this trip, I could sense his determination,"" she said, adding that his latest adventure is significantly longer than his first one. ""He has my full support and encouragement."" In May, Muhtar walked through an area with gale-force winds in Turpan, once a crossroads of Central Asia and a strategic stop on the overland trade route linking China with ancient India, Persia and Rome. ""Each step required a lot of strength and my face was being slammed by waves of sand blown up by the strong gale,"" he said, adding that sand blew into his mouth and he had to crouch down to protect himself. ""I am aware that the journey will be extremely tough. The valley ahead is located between a wild desert and mountains. However, I think I will manage to get through it."" Muhtar, whose trip will cost an estimated 20,000 yuan, is being sponsored by a charity organization founded in September by Wang Long, a native of Xinjiang who was presented with a Good People in China award for his bravery in saving people from a fire. In each city that Muhtar travels to, the organization will assist him in publicizing his cause to help raise money for schools. In addition to helping with Muhtar's trip, it also regularly organizes donations of books and others materials for children in need."
0,"BEIJING -- A Beijing political advisor has proposed that ivory carving factories be converted into non-profit research institutions to pass on the cultural heritage after China imposed an ivory trading ban at the end of 2017. The institutions can undertake repairs of ivory antiques and research and training of carving skills instead of producing carvings for commercial sale, Song Weizu, member of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said at the ongoing annual meeting of the committee. ""For example, the Forbidden City has a large amount of ivory antiques that need professional repairs,"" said Song, also former vice president of Beijing Arts and Crafts Association, adding that the government should connect the institutions with cultural heritage protection organizations. China's State Forestry Administration announced that China had banned commercial processing and sale of ivory as planned by the end of 2017, a commitment to protect wild animals. The ban has affected 34 processing companies and 143 designated trading venues, all of which have suspended operations, according to the administration. ""Cultural authorities should help with the reassignment of ivory carving masters and other practitioners in the industry,"" said a 2016 document issued by the State Council. Song advised the government to assign a designated department to govern the institutions, approve their establishment, and also legitimize the inheritance of ivory carving skills. Ivory carving was listed as state-level intangible cultural heritage in 2006. It saw its peak in the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), with Beijing in the north and Guangzhou in the south the two ivory-carving centers at that time. Carved ivory, together with cloisonne, jade and lacquerware, are considered Beijing's top four traditional artwares. ""We support the government's act to protect wild animals, however, we cannot afford to loose this intangible cultural heritage,"" Song said."
0,"Maison and Object showcases creative products in Beijing. A little bit of Parisian savoir faire has found its way to Beijing as the Maison and Object Design Pavilion recently opened at WF Central, a shopping center in the capital. The pavilion, which originates from Paris and showcases more than 30 brands - 12 of which are making their Chinese debut - will run for two months. In addition, the pavilion will showcase the works of six designers who have been awarded the accolade ""designer of the year"" by M&O, including: Andre Fu from Hong Kong, the founder of AFSO; Euge ni Quitllet, a Catalonian designer whose works are characterized by flow design and digital precision; Oki Santo from Japan, who drew inspiration from Japanese minimalism; Philippe Nigro, a veteran French designer who has been working in the industry for more than 20 years; Ramy Fischler, a Belgian designer who is deeply influenced by film art and Tom Dixon, a self-taught British designer, who was awarded an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) by the Queen in recognition of his outstanding achievements in the design industry. Based on the image of King Kong, the giant ape from the eponymous 1933 Hollywood classic, a five-meter high pink polyethylene gorilla lamp named ""Kong"" has been erected and will serve as pavilion's mascot. Together with 19 others - in smaller sizes and in varying colors of pink, black and white - they welcome the visitors at the entrance of the shopping center. Originally designed by Qeeboo, a furniture and accessory brand launched by Italian designer Stefano Giovannoni in 2016, each one of them is holding a flashlight. A blue Iron archway forms the entrance to the main exhibition area on the third floor of the shopping center, while a bridge made from the same material is suspended from the ceiling. These curation settings apparently represent the oriental culture and Chinese traditional elements that the local residents are familiar with. Fu and Nigro attended the opening ceremony and talked about their design philosophies. With the theme of Love Design, Fu revealed that he wanted to strike a chord with the visitors of the pavilion - to let the audiences discover the attention that he paid to the design of the objects, and that his spirit will reach their heart and create a new memory. ""The lifestyle is not intentionally created, but it comes from the heart,"" he explained. ""The hardest challenge for me as a designer is to hold on to my own belief. It's important to be truthful to myself, and create products that I truly believe in."",He claimed that design is not just about responding to what's fashionable at the moment, or what's the ""in"" color. For an interior designer who is also an architect, his commercial design work usually expresses his feeling toward the city, the context of the neighborhood and how he feels about the particular brand that he is collaborating with at the time. Having studied his master's degree in architecture at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom, Fu has absorbed wisdom from mixed cultural backgrounds. However, he never bothers to distinguish the origins of elements that he applies to his designs. ""I hate to generalize eastern culture as a whole, as well as the western culture. I draw inspiration from the life that I live,"" Fu said. Nigro defined luxurious design as high quality personalized objects, made of superb materials, which exude elegance. He pays a lot of attention to the functionality of the products he designs, and he wants to establish an intimate relationship between the object and its user. He also showed his appreciation toward M&O. He said that being recognized as designer of the year in 2014 has brought him much more visibility and awareness, and the chance to collaborate with different brands including the likes of Japanese automotive company, Lexus. He described the pavilion by saying that it exhibits everything that people who live in a house will ever need."
1,"Private enterprises play an important role in almost every facet of the Chinese economy, and now they have begun to march into a top-notch field long dominated by State-owned companies－the space industry. The duopoly of State-owned giants China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp and China Aerospace Science and Industry Corp remains unchallenged because they are in control of the most essential part of the space business－the carrier rockets. However, private players appear to be very close to breaking the duopoly. In the latest attempt from the private sector, OneSpace Technology, a space startup based in Beijing, announced on Tuesday that it has finished the construction and testing of its first carrier rocket, the OS-M, and is ready to transport it to the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwestern China for the model's debut mission in late March. If the mission is successful, OS-M will become the first carrier rocket designed and built by a private Chinese company to fulfill an orbital launch. In October, LandSpace, another private space company based in Beijing, launched a carrier rocket, the first of its ZQ 1 series, at the Jiuquan center, aiming to complete an orbital mission. However, the rocket, which carried a small satellite, failed to reach orbit due to mechanical malfunctions. OneSpace said in a statement on Tuesday that OS-M is a type of solid-propellant rocket with four stages. It is 19 meters long and weighs 20 metric tons when loaded with fuel and satellites. The booster is able to place satellites into orbit at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1,000 kilometers above the earth. Zhang Jie, chief designer of OS-M, said engineers have examined and tested the compatibility and stability of equipment mounted on the rocket and the launchpad. They have also verified the launch sequence, ground control and tracking procedures, he added. Established by Shu Chang, who has been dubbed China's Elon Musk, and several companions in 2015, OneSpace Technology has carried out two successful suborbital launches of its OS-X sounding rocket and has received huge amounts of investment from the capital market. The company aims to thrive in the burgeoning commercial space market in China. Since the beginning of China's space industry, the research and development of carrier rockets has been tightly held by State-owned enterprises. However, in the wake of private firms' rise in the global space sphere, the Chinese government has realized that it is necessary to introduce new players to stimulate innovation and competition and to fill gaps in the market left by State-owned contractors. President Xi Jinping has instructed the nation's long-insulated space industry to open its doors to private participants and take advantage of their participation to boost sustainable growth. Several government departments have published policies and guidelines that encourage private enterprises to take part in space-related businesses. As a result, nearly 10 private rocket firms have come into existence in China over the past three years. OneSpace, i-Space and LandSpace, all based in Beijing, have become leading firms when it comes to research and production capabilities, as well as funding. LandSpace and i-Space have also announced that they want to make at least one launch of their carrier rockets, but have yet to publish a schedule."
1,"An outline released on Wednesday on the integrated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region has offered further details on how the capital's resources and industries will be redistributed. The ultimate goal is to move noncapital functions away from downtown Beijing, which will aid efforts to control population growth. According to the outline, Tongzhou district and the Xiongan New Area, which covers three counties in Hebei province, are two key destinations for the relocated resources. Municipal administrative offices will be moved to Tongzhou, which also will develop commercial services, tourism and technology innovation as major industries, according to Liu Bozheng, deputy head of the Beijing Development and Reform Commission, the city's economic planner. Xiongan will develop mainly high-tech and innovative industries, he said. ""The aim is to attract innovative resources to create industrial clusters and create a work-life balance for the population."" The outline, released by the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Integrated Development Office, also clarifies the functions of four strategic areas: the Caofeidian Integrated Development Zone in Hebei, the Beijing New Airport Economic Zone, Tianjin Binhai New Area and the Zhangjiakou-Chengde Ecological Area, also in Hebei. Steel processing and petrochemicals will move to Caofeidian, a major port in northern China; aviation logistics and high-tech industries will move to the new airport economic zone; and financial services, digital centers and technology companies will head to the Binhai New Area. Zhangjiakou, co-host with Beijing of the 2022 Winter Olympics, will develop sports, culture, tourism and exhibition services, the outline added. In addition to the two key places and four strategic areas, the outline also indicates that the Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei governments will work together to develop 46 industrial regions－15 for innovation, 20 for modern manufacturing, eight for services and three for agriculture industries. Supportive policies in terms of finance, land supply and environmental protection will be offered to help develop these regions. For instance, Tianjin has been working on favorable policies to attract technology companies from Beijing. Bai Xiangdong, a senior official with the Tianjin branch of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Integrated Development Office, said several State-owned companies such as Sinomec Group, an energy service provider, have signed contracts to relocate regional headquarters to Tianjin. Some private companies such as Mobike and Didi Chuxing also have signed on to locate their business units in Tianjin's Binhai New Area. The aim of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Integrated Development is to realize coordinated development of the region, better protect the environment and make Beijing a livable and harmonious capital. The development plan of Beijing (2016-35) released earlier this year caps the capital's population at 23 million and calls for more green space."
1,"China's AI industry has embraced rapid growth in recent five years, said Wang Xiaochuan, CEO of the Chinese search engine Sogou, on Wednesday in Wuzhen, East China's Zhejiang province. ""At the basic scientific level, there is still a gap between China and the United States. While at the application level, China is able to become the world's leading experimenter,"" Wang said in an exclusive interview with China Daily website at the fifth World Internet Conference. China's large population created advantages in big data, which is the key driver for AI ecology today represented by deep learning. ""The spirit of entrepreneurs, coupled with our previous low-level data accumulation and extensive application market, has taken China to an internet era and opened an opportunity to apply AI technologies. China can improve its competitiveness in the world and improve people's daily lives if we can make good use of this window period to upgrade the AI industry,"" Wang added. Beijing-based Sogou, which went public on the New York Stock Exchange in November last year, runs China's most popular input method and the second-largest search engine and Sogou browser. ""Sogou has 500 million daily users of input method and 400 million daily users of search engine, so we are clear about application scenarios and data accumulation for AI development,"" Wang said. Sogou's language-centered AI technologies have been widely applied in providing daily and simultaneous interpretation services in various scenarios. ""Language is still a barrier in today's globalization of information civilization,"" Wang said. ""We took it up as a mission to solve the translation problem with AI technologies and big data."" ""We believe that with the landing of translation technologies, the future era is not only informationzation, but the beginning of an intelligent civilization."" Sogou launched the world's first virtual anchor technology on the opening day of the internet conference, which began on Wednesday and ends on Friday. The technology can create an AI avatar model the same with the real anchor through cutting-edge technologies, such as detecting key points on the face, extracting face features, face reconstruction, lip-reading recognition and emotion migration. A piece of synthetically video news with the AI avatar can be created by the machine after training and calculating video and audio materials from the real anchor. China's top leader recently called for stepping up efforts to develop the new generation of artificial intelligence technology and stressed that China will unswervingly encourage, support and guide the development of the non-public sector and support private enterprises to develop toward a broader stage. ""I feel so honored to be in this time and we should work harder to not live up to such an opportunity,"" said Wang. To describe China's social and economic achievements after the country introduced the reform and opening-up policy 40 years ago, Wang said it brought earth-shaking changes and offered ""opportunity, prosperity and convenience"" to all ordinary Chinese people. ""We live in an era of miracle. We expect more guidance from the government in the process of China's further reform and opening-up, which will encourage us for more innovation,"" Wang added. ""I see more companies presenting their scientific and technological achievements and their business abilities at the conference and I myself would like to take some time to visit the exhibitions,"" said Wang. ""It's a new trend."" Sogou reported revenue of $276.57 million for the third quarter of the year."
0,"An exhibition titled Treasures of China will open in Riyadh as part of an exchange program that saw Saudi relics displayed in Beijing last year, Wang Kaihao reports. From December 2016 to March 2017, a major cultural relics exhibition, Roads of Arabia: Archaeological Treasures of Saudi Arabia, was held at the National Museum of China in Beijing. Its closing ceremony was attended by President Xi Jinping and Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud in a mark of its success. The exhibition, which included 400-odd artifacts from 15 Saudi museums, served as a reminder to the Chinese public that Saudi Arabia can not simply be stereotyped as a land of oil and wealth, but also as a country with a rich history and culture.,Following a nihao (hello) from the Saudi side, it is now the turn of their Chinese counterparts to reply with a ""salaam"" by sending some of their national treasures to Riyadh to showcase the prominence of ancient Chinese civilizations. Treasures of China will open at the National Museum of Saudi Arabia on Sept 13, putting 264 exhibits, including 173 cultural relics, from China on display, it was announced at a news conference in Beijing last week. This will be the largest Chinese cultural relics exhibition ever to be held in the region, and is due to run until Nov 23.,According to Xu He, curator of the exhibition from Art Exhibitions China, an organization in charge of Sino-foreign cultural relics exchange exhibitions, 13 institutions nationwide－including the Palace Museum in Beijing, the Shaanxi History Museum in Xi'an, and the Luoyang Museum in Henan province－sent contributions from their collections for the upcoming exhibition. ""We want to present a comprehensive history of China to Saudi visitors,"" Xu says. ""The artifacts will be displayed in time order. ""The different facets of the Chinese dynasties over the centuries are shown through people's lifestyles, artistic achievements and their communication with foreign countries,"" she says. ""The continuity and inclusiveness of Chinese civilization will be reflected through this."",Many of the most globally recognized Chinese cultural relics have been chosen for this exhibition, like the oldest artifact in China's catalog－a pot dating back to 3000 BC which is decorated with images of human faces and fish. It was unearthed in Banpo, a Neolithic relic site in Shaanxi province. The world-famous Terracotta Warriors, which will also be on show, are known for being the life-size figurine soldiers that guard the mausoleum of Qinshihuang, the first Chinese ""emperor"" from the 3rd century BC, in today's Xi'an. A two-meter-high figurine of an admiral was chosen for the exhibition to allow people to catch a glimpse of ""Qinshihuang's secret army"". Admiral figurines are very precious, since only a handful of them were dug up during the excavation work at the mausoleum.,It might be the case that this warrior was selected for his friendly gesture, as he looks like he's about to shake hands. He will also be escorted by three soldiers and a horse-drawn chariot from the mausoleum for this trip to Riyadh. ""This (display) will be the most number of Terracotta Warriors that we have ever agreed to send abroad for a comprehensive exhibition,"" Xu adds. Another highlight will be a jade outfit sewn with gold threads. Burial suits like these were used exclusively for emperors and their closest kin during the Han Dynasty (206 BC to AD 220). It was unearthed from a Han vassal king's tomb in today's Xuzhou, Jiangsu province.,The curator was careful to select items that specifically reflect Chinese national totems like the easily-recognizable C-shaped jade dragon and items bearing images of dragons and phoenixes, and items that connect with Arabic culture. ""The ancient Silk Road was crucial conduit for cultural communication between the Islamic world and China,"" Xu says. ""This is why we have so many cultural relics in China that reflect the influence of Islamic culture."" Many of the exhibits from the Tang Dynasty (618-907) used figurines on camels and figurines of Western Asian people; ceramics inscribed with Arabic words, and Islamic tombstones from Zayton (today's Quanzhou, Fujian province)－a pivotal trade port on Maritime Silk Road in the Song (960-1279) and Yuan (1271-1368) dynasties.,Speaking about the upcoming event, Fahad Majed Alshareef, the Saudi cultural attache in China, says: ""Saudi people have great expectations for the exhibition because it is a rare chance for us to see the brilliance of traditional Chinese culture first hand."" ""The connection between China and Saudi Arabia is another example that shows how different civilizations and religions continue to maintain dialogue and learn from each other."" He also adds that China's Belt and Road Initiative can link more closely with the Saudi Vision 2030 plan through projects like this. The Saudi plan aims to reduce the country's dependence on oil and diversify the Saudi economy by developing public service sectors－including culture and tourism.,In January 2016, during President Xi's visit to Saudi Arabia, the State Administration of Cultural Heritage signed a memorandum of understanding with the Saudi Commission for Tourism and National Heritage to promote comprehensive bilateral cooperation in the cultural heritage sector. The exchange of exhibitions by the two capital cities of the respective countries is only a part of this joint framework, according to Xie Bing, director of the SACH foreign communications department. Meanwhile, from March to April this year, archaeologists from the National Center of Underwater Cultural Heritage conducted a joint research project with Saudi experts on al-Serrian, the ruins of an ancient port city near Mecca, which boomed between the 9th and 13th centuries. ""Achievements in the underwater excavation work have gone far beyond our expectations,"" Xie says. ""Many crucial pieces of evidence about the Maritime Silk Road were unearthed during the archaeological survey."",Chinese porcelain pieces from the Song and Yuan dynasties were found at the ruins. Some of the newest findings from al-Serrian will also be displayed at the exhibition in Riyadh alongside artifacts supplied by Chinese museums for comparison. For example, a bronze counterweight from al-Serrian will be juxtaposed with an counterpart from the Nanhai One, the sunken wreck of a Song Dynasty merchant ship discovered in the South China Sea. Xie also says that the project in al-Serrian will mark the start of a five-year archaeological cooperation program between the two countries, and more projects－both undersea and land-bound－are due to follow. He also says that cooperation on cultural heritage will expand to cover more fields, such as staff training, development of protection technologies, fighting the illicit trade of cultural relics and museum management."
1,"Chinese Culture Group Co Ltd's foray into indoor theme parks will further stoke fresh investments in children-centric businesses in the Chinese mainland, industry observers said. The move follows the end of the one-child policy and the subsequent rise in the number of families with more than one child. The culture and media company announced earlier this month that it will open more than 15 indoor theme parks in the Chinese mainland over the next eight years. The planned parks will be Oddbods-themed, based on a cartoon series produced by Singapore's One Animation. They will have recreation facilities, restaurants and gift shops, and aim to attract children aged 3 to 9, said Xie Li, vice-president of Chinese Culture Group. Compared with large-scale theme parks, which need big investments, long gestation periods and high costs related to construction, smaller indoor theme parks require lower costs, promise stable cash flows and decent returns on investment, Xie said. Population data from Pingan Securities showed those aged 14 or under are increasing in number, on the back of the policy change. This has boosted related consumption. Children's parks netted about 300 billion yuan ($44.9 billion) in sales and other revenues last year. Indoor parks played an important part in that, it said. ""Indoor theme parks are more suitable to expand with smaller investment. It's also easier for them to earn profits,"" Chen Shaofeng, deputy dean of the Institute for Cultural Industries at Peking University, told The Beijing News earlier this month. Small wonder, animation companies, real estate operators and other companies began to show interest in the segment. Domestic leading animation group Guangdong Alpha Animation and Culture Co, producer of popular cartoon Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf, announced in May that it will open over 50 indoor parks based on its intellectual property or IP over the next three years. Property giants Guangzhou Evergrande and Dalian Wanda Group have also entered this segment of the theme park sector. Li Mingyu, product director of indoor theme park operator Beijing Zhiyou Culture Communication Co Ltd, said the market has great potential for future growth. ""After all, the 200 million Chinese children need some place to play. And there aren't many public playgrounds in China compared with other countries,"" he said. The company invested 10 million yuan to build a 1,500-square-meter indoor theme park in Beijing, inspired by domestic cartoon character Luo Bao Bei. The park opened for business in July last year. Li did not share financial details like profit and rate of return, saying the firm expected to break even two years after the investment. Membership fee, catering services, training courses for children, as well as sales of toys and other commodities, contribute 60 to 70 percent of its income. Wages and rent account for 90 percent of its operational costs. They don't have to pay for the IP, because the IP owner is one of the firm's shareholders, he said. Li Qin, brand-licensing leader of Zhejiang Versatile Media Co Ltd, an animation producer, said the firm authorized three indoor park operators to use the images of their cartoon. (Again, Li of Versatile declined to share details like IP-related revenue.) ""Though kids are allowed to play at the park for a whole day, most of them will lose patience and leave within two hours, creating park-space for others. Besides, the membership system adopted by many operators can guarantee a stable cash flow,"" she said. Shi, mother of a 5-year-old boy, said she has a small bag, filled with membership cards of various indoor theme parks. She could not resist them at promotional events where discounts abounded. Each visit to a park costs about 100 yuan. And buying five staggered visits at one go could come in cheaper at about 300 yuan, she said. Spending weekend at shopping malls has become a routine for Shi's family. The boy would first play at an indoor theme park for one or two hours, then they have lunch or dinner, go shopping and then home. ""Two days (over the weekend) is too short for an outstation trip, but we don't want our son to stay at home all the time watching TV or playing games on mobile phone. That's why, we go to shopping malls,"" she said. ""Besides, playing indoors can keep the child away from the haze and bad weather."" At the indoor park, her son may slide, climb, ride a mini train or play video games. She and her husband sit outside, having some time of their own. Among Shi's concerns are issues like the parks being overcrowded often (which could result in noise and children quarreling) and safety at the facilities. Li from Beijing Zhiyou said operators need to innovate and introduce diverse activities like dancing and singing performances, holiday parties and training classes, to differentiate themselves from others. Use of well-known IP such as that of Marvel Comics can also help attract more customers, but that requires big investment, he said."
1,"A senior Chinese negotiator will visit the United States at Washington's invitation late this month to resume trade talks, the Ministry of Commerce said on Thursday. It will be the first bilateral meeting since the Sino-US trade dispute escalated in June, attracting lots of attention and high expectations. On the invitation of the US, a delegation led by Wang Shouwen, vice-minister of commerce and China's deputy international trade representative, will meet with a team led by the US Treasury's Undersecretary for International Affairs David Malpass, the ministry said in a statement. The two sides will hold consultations on each other's concerns about Sino-US economic and trade issues, the ministry said. ""The Chinese side opposes unilateralism and trade protectionism practices and does not accept any unilateral trade restriction measures,"" said the statement. ""China welcomes dialogue and communication on the basis of reciprocity, equality and integrity."" Beijing has retaliated after Washington slapped tariffs in goods since they held their last high-level meeting in June. The tension raised fears that their trade dispute will shake the global economy. It was unclear whether the talks will take place before or after Thursday, when Washington has said it will activate additional tariffs on $16 billion in Chinese goods. Beijing has said it will retaliate in kind.,At the last official round of talks in early June, US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross met with Vice-Premier Liu He in Beijing. Experts said Wang's visit to the US is expected to be helpful not only in reducing misunderstanding between the two governments but also in offering hope for progress in lessening the friction that has set global markets on edge. Li Yong, deputy director of the China Association of International Trade Expert Committee, said conducting the vice-ministerial level meeting means the two sides will talk about many specific issues, such as how to increase imports from each other's markets in different sectors and build a solid foundation for higher-level official meetings. ""As the bilateral trade friction has affected global value and supply chains, as well as many countries' financial markets, it is time for both sides to talk about what they can offer to temporarily avoid a global economic slowdown and an escalation of the trade war,"" he said. Makoto Sengoku, a market analyst at Tokai Tokyo Research Institute, told AFP: ""It is hard to tell how the talks will go, but it's a positive signal that the two countries are looking for some compromise plan. If they were determined to fight it out, they wouldn't meet."" US trade policy toward China has been fairly self-contradictory, which reflects the gap of interests between different government branches, said Dong Yan, a senior researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. ""As you can see from the previous talks, the US Treasury Department still wanted a negotiated settlement because it sought a sustainable China-US economic relationship, while the Office of the US Trade Representative has been playing tougher with Chinese shipments,"" she said. Dong said there have been some impacts on the real economy in the United States as tariffs have been enacted in the past two months. This has caused opinion disparities among different government departments, multinational companies and business groups within the US, she said."
0,"More measures against school bullying have been rolled out in different districts in Beijing to put a stop to the illegal practice. Dongcheng district in Beijing has asked schools to report bullying incidence to education authorities within 10 minutes of its occurrence and submit written report within two hours, reported Beijing Youth Daily. The move came after the city's education commission pledged to step up efforts against bullying in primary and middle schools earlier this year. Haidian district told schools to include anti-bullying efforts in their work plans and educate students of the harm and prevention of bullying and the legal responsibilities involved. Fengtai district specified the responsibility of schools in preventing bullying and made detailed requirements on how education officials, principals and teachers should be evaluated on their anti-bullying efforts. Bullying has long been a ghost that has haunted many students in primary and secondary schools. According to a report published by China Emergency Management Society in 2017, one in fourth of polled primary and secondary school students has been bullied in school. Bullying often occurs at hidden places, Song Yanhui, an associate professor at China Youth University of Political Studies, told China National Radio. ""Places such as toilet are where many cases of bullying take place, because it is out of the reach of video surveillance."" Bullying at such places has made headlines many times in recent years. In 2017, five students in a school in Beijing's Yanqing district were put in administrative detention for forcing a schoolmate to touch excrement in toilet. In December 2016, a Beijing mother's article describing her 10-year-old son's being bullied at school went viral. The fourth-grade boy had a toilet paper basket thrown on his head and was being mocked by classmates. After that, he was diagnosed with an acute stress disorder."
0,"The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei province region is expected to see moderate to heavy air pollution from Thursday to Sunday because of unfavorable weather conditions, according to a forecast released by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment on Wednesday. The hourly average concentration of PM2.5 is expected to climb to 200 micrograms per cubic meter, it said. According to the forecast, this round of pollution will influence both the capital region and neighboring areas, including Shanxi and Henan provinces, with the central places affected most. Beijing and several cities in Hebei province, including Shijiazhuang, Baoding, Tangshan and Langfang, will experience moderate to heavy air pollution. Hebei, which surrounds Beijing and usually has frequent smog during winter, issued an orange alert－the second-highest level－for air pollution on Wednesday. Smog is expected to ease gradually starting Sunday night, when cold air arrives in the region. PM2.5, hazardous fine particulate matter with a diameter of less than 2.5 microns, has been a major index for measuring air pollution and is the primary pollutant this time. To improve air quality, China set a target to reduce the average intensity of PM2.5 by about 3 percent year-on-year in the region and surrounding areas from October to March, according to an official plan released in September. During the period, the number of days with heavy air pollution should be also reduced by about 3 percent year-on-year, the plan said. Compared with last year's goal of reducing the average intensity of PM2.5 by 15 percent for the period, this year's target has eased up, a reporter said at a news conference held by the ministry on Wednesday. Ministry spokesman Liu Youbin responded, ""This is a misunderstanding about the plan, and the lower target doesn't mean we will reduce efforts to combat air pollution."" The mission is tough because the remaining space for reducing emissions has been narrowed after years of effort to improve the region's air quality, Liu said. ""Adjusting the structure of industry, energy resources, transportation and land use are difficult tasks in the process of controlling air pollution,"" Liu said, adding that change cannot happen overnight and the effect might not be seen immediately. Weather conditions from December to February in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region will be more unfavorable for dispersing pollutants compared to the same period last year, Liu said."
0,"XIAMEN - Hector Jesus Palacio from Colombia was never a singer until he thought of a song with Chinese lyrics in a dream. Titled Zhongguo Hao in Mandarin - China is Great in English - the song narrates Palacio's personal story in the country where he has lived for more than 20 years. He shot a music video and posted it on social media platforms such as WeChat and Facebook. The song, which has around 1.3 million views, made the 51-year-old Palacio famous overnight. In September 1994, Palacio came to Beijing to study. He didn't speak any Chinese, and the limited impression he had about China centered on Bruce Lee and kung fu. ""In the beginning, I couldn't get used to the food here. Chinese people like to use vinegar and soybean sauce in their food. It is quite different in Colombia,"" Palacio said. He overcame the initial hardships mainly using body language. To order food in Chinese restaurants, he pointed at dishes that other customers had ordered - a gamble that brought him both pleasant and distasteful surprises. He carried a map whenever he explored the city - with his campus circled in red - so he could ask people how to get back. Nevertheless, there were times he went the wrong way or took the wrong bus. The first Christmas he spent in Beijing was not a sweet memory. He hadn't adapted to the capital's cold winters and was still unable to speak Chinese. Loneliness was his closest friend in the silence of the night. These hardships were vividly depicted in the words of his recent song - ""Crying alone in my room. Every day I miss my home."" The friends he made in China encouraged him to find a silver lining. They played soccer, hung out on weekends and talked with each other. ""There was a time I had dysentery and was in the hospital. My Chinese friends visited me with flowers and fruits, but none of my South American friends in Beijing showed up,"" he recalled, with tears in his eyes. Palacio used a verse to explain the support he received from his Chinese friends and express his gratitude. As a student, he spent two years learning Chinese, and the third year majoring in physical training. After graduation, he worked as an English and Spanish teacher for kindergarten students and adults in Beijing. To learn more about China, he moved to Shanghai, Hangzhou in Zhejiang province, and Taiwan, and worked as a language instructor and scuba diving instructor, before finally settling down in the coastal city of Xiamen, Fujian province, in 2005. In Xiamen, he met Wu Jingling, a local woman with long black hair, and the couple got married in 2012. ""Who would have thought that I'd stay in China? I planned to go back home after graduation,"" he said with a laugh. Palacio now works as a business consultant in a South American company, helping facilitate business with Chinese enterprises. His peaceful, stable life has seen unexpected changes after a dream he had in July 2017, like ripples in the water. ""I was singing a song with my friends at a summer party in my town in Colombia. They asked me, 'Why do you sing in Chinese? We can't understand what you sing,'"" he recalled. He suddenly woke up and realized it was just a dream. He then recorded the lingering melody on his cellphone. It was an incomplete piece of vallenato - a folk music style from Colombia's Caribbean region inscribed as an intangible cultural heritage. Vallenato is usually played with an accordion and a small drum, but he didn't know anyone who could play those in Xiamen. A miracle occurred the following winter when he met Angel Emir Soto in the city of Chongqing during a friendly soccer match between China and Colombia. Soto is a professional musician who plays the accordion. He came to China in 2015 and lives in Fuzhou, Fujian province, a two-hour trip on a bullet train to Xiamen. ""Palacio needed to finish writing the lyrics,"" Soto said. ""Then I spent two weeks producing the song in my studio."" To come up with the lyrics, Palacio was also inspired and encouraged by his mother-in-law, who told him ""to sing about what you actually feel will touch people's hearts"". In addition to videos they posted online, they also performed live in bars in Xiamen at the invitation of friends, with both of them singing and Soto playing his orange accordion. ""The audience clapped their hands to the beat and gave us thumbs-up,"" Palacio said. Music knows no boundaries. The duo is working on their second project, translating a Chinese song into Spanish. ""We want to bring China and Southern American countries such as Colombia closer through music,"" Palacio said. Xinhua"
0,"The observation that less is more, first associated with the German-American architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe more than 70 years ago, has been embraced by a growing number of minimalists seeking to rid their minds and living environments of clutter and counter frenzied consumerism. Lin Hanxing is one of them. The 30-year-old, who lives in Beijing, owns just five shirts, two pairs of pants, four pairs of shoes, a trenchcoat, a down jacket and a meager smattering of various other items. All her belongings fit in a small suitcase. Five years ago, Lin said she was a member of the ""hand-chopping mafia"" - a slang internet term referring to shopaholics who feel the urge to figuratively cut off their hands to stop impulse buying. Lin, who works as an interpreter for an international company, said she used to spend lots of money buying fashionable clothes in the hope of ""winning people's recognition and attention"". At one time, she owned more than 400 items of clothing, shoes and handbags. These not only cluttered her 25-square-meter apartment in Beijing but also became an economic burden. ""My salary was around 15,000 yuan ($2,230) per month, but my monthly credit card bill would sometimes reach 25,000 to 30,000 yuan back then,"" Lin said. In 2014, she saw an online challenge had been launched by Joshua Becker, a blogger in the United States promoting a minimalist lifestyle. Participants were encouraged to reduce the number of possessions to less than 100. Lin decided to give it a try. She discarded 90 percent of her clothes, decorations, cookware, furniture, linen, tools and books, along with anything else in her home that was not ""essential to life"". In addition, she deleted 120 contacts on her social networking account to whom she had never spoken. After purging her life of much physical and emotional baggage, Lin said she felt ""lighter"". China is one of many countries that have been swept by a wave of minimalism as a lifestyle choice. While an increasing number of Chinese consumers have acquired strong purchasing power in recent years, some urbanites, such as Lin, are abandoning consumerism to pursue a more ascetic lifestyle as minimalists. Minimalism as a lifestyle philosophy is simple - the less you own, the happier you will be. Pare down and unclutter, the thinking goes, and your mind will have room to breathe. But minimalism comes in different forms. Some people are getting rid of books, papers, unused toys or even TV sets. Others are taking matters a step further, and once they have shed their possessions, they are moving out of their large homes in favor of smaller apartments. Some are attempting to reduce the barrage of information they face each day by limiting time spent on the internet. A report in The Wall Street Journal last year said consumerism is at its peak, thanks to multiple factors - ""rising income, fast fashion, ease of e-commerce and a wider embrace of use-and-throw culture as technology advances"". These are all combining to make frequent product upgrades a buyer's ritual.,Zhu Rui, a consumer market researcher in Beijing, said, ""Amid constant stimulation from society, many consumers now feel that things may have gone beyond their control."" Zhu said most well-off Chinese, who have gone through a time of ""material scarcity"", are now using possessions as status symbols to show they are living a good life, adding, ""After getting rich, people like to purchase a lot of expensive things. ""However, when they become aware that what they possess is actually a kind of burden, or does not represent their taste at all, some may think differently about their lifestyles,"" and turn to minimalism to regain control. According to Becker, minimalism, which first emerged in some developed countries, is growing as a lifestyle movement because of ""an overwhelming worry of global financial turmoil"". He launched the blog becomingminimalist.com, which promotes a minimalist lifestyle and has garnered more than 1.3 million followers. He offered an explanation of why people across the US and the developed world are abandoning consumerism to live more simply: ""Rising unemployment, stagnant wages and falling stock prices have forced families and individuals to re-evaluate their purchases. People have begun living on tighter budgets. As a result, many consumers are choosing to identify the difference between essential and nonessential purchases."" Sociologist Joel Stillerman said there is a connection between minimalism and a quest for well-being among certain educated, upper-middle-class areas of society in the US and other Western countries. In his book The Sociology of Consumption: A Global Approach he states that minimalism is also meant to ""project taste, refinement and aesthetic knowledge"". ""These people are making the statement: 'I can afford to have less. I appreciate books and travel and good meals',"" he said. Zeb Smith, 30, from the US, became a minimalist in 2014 after losing his job. He discovered that by reducing the number of items he owned, he had a better quality of life. Smith said he grew up in a typical US consumerist family. ""We had so many toys, clothes, videotapes, books and other things that you could not see the floor in our house. The messy home caused serious stress in my parents' marriage. They eventually got divorced."" After losing his job, Smith and his wife moved to Colorado from Idaho, a distance of 1,450 kilometers. ""We could not afford a big trailer for the move, so we had to get rid of a lot of things. After we got to Colorado, we bought more things again, and marriage was hard. I worked all day and came home to a messy house."" Smith and his wife noticed that their cluttered home was causing them stress. While his wife, Lauren, searched on the internet for ways to solve the problem, Smith wrote a book titled Minimalism in Real Life: 4 1/2 Practical Steps Towards a Meaningful Life, which was published under the name Jefferson Gow. Learning from his experience, he said he hoped to help people systematically create peace in their homes by practicing minimalism. ""Things are so affordable now that they no longer work as symbols of social status. Cleanliness and tidiness are becoming the new marks of wealth,"" he said. In the US, millennials - the 18 to 34 age group that comprises more than 25 percent of the population and the majority of the workforce - are the main driving force seeking a minimalist lifestyle. Robin Lewis, a US retail expert said: ""Millennials have a unique set of values around how they choose to spend their money. They grew up during the recession, entered a struggling job market and must now pay off record amounts of debt."" He said the millennial generation is bigger than that of the baby boomers in terms of numbers, but has less money. ""This is a big threat to the economy. They're not into a lot of shopping,"" Lewis added. But this may not be the case in China. A report by market research company Euromonitor in London found young Chinese consumers spend less on possessions, but tend to spend more on, for example, short holidays and visits to the movies, with ticket sales rising by 13.5 percent last year. Alison Angus, head of lifestyles at Euromonitor, said this, in part, is driven by the rise of a Chinese counter-culture dubbed wenqing, or ""cultured youth"", but perhaps is better expressed by the word ""hipster"". ""They are rejecting materialism, which sort of goes against the grain in China,"" Angus said. ""They are looking for a life that is all about culture. They spend their leisure time reading poetry, going to art galleries, looking after pets and drinking little alcohol."" However, some brands are still trying to tap the new generation of Chinese who have consciously decided to consume less. These approaches can take different forms. They range from the functional basics of Japanese retail company Muji and the production of simple quality clothing by Uniqlo, to subscription services, which are replacing ownership of music, books, movies and software. Electronic books and devices such as Kindle are among the top items bought by Chinese born in the 1990s and 2000s, according to data from Iresearch. Other industry trends in China, such as the booming sharing economy, in which, for example, consumers choose to use new services available through Didi and Mobike rather than buy cars, are also evidence of this trend, the report said. Prakash Ghai, an Indian minimalist, tried to introduce the concept to his country through photography. ""People first learn to acquire before learning to give up,"" he said, adding that although the minimalism movement has been evident for some years in the Western world, it is still a relatively new concept in India because ""many Indians are still learning to acquire"". But statistics from Google Trends show that minimalism is spreading from the Middle East to Western Europe. The top five countries and regions searching for information on ""minimalism"" in 2017 were Hong Kong, Iran, South Korea, the United Kingdom and the Philippines. In Asia, the most prominent minimalist is Japanese expert Marie Kondo, whose book The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up has sold millions of copies worldwide and inspired countless numbers of people to reorganize their homes and lives. Although Kondo focuses on tidiness, the psychological benefits of this overlap with the minimalists' goals. The book struck a chord with many middle-class readers and fueled their enthusiasm for minimalist lifestyles.,Zhou Yiyan, a fan of the book, was inspired by it and has capitalized on many middle-class Chinese consumers' desire for minimalism. In 2015, she launched a public account on WeChat called the No. 1 Organizing Platform, with the aim of introducing consumers to Japanese home organization techniques and to onsite consultants operating in China. Just 18 months later, her account has more than 200,000 followers. Zhou said Chinese clients who hire a well-regarded professional home organizer will likely have to pay about 1,500 yuan for a five-hour consultation. As it generally takes five to eight sessions to organize a home, the cost of making a house less cluttered can sometimes exceed 10,000 yuan. ""Uncluttering and minimizing are part of the process of getting organized,"" Zhou said. ""The main process in professional organizing is to edit and re-edit in order to fill your space with only worthy things. By minimizing, people are eliminating the things they don't love to create space for those they do."" Zhou, who describes herself as a ""uncluttering consultant"", predicts that China will be swept by the trend to rid living areas of homes in first-tier cities of too many possessions. ""There are three main reasons behind this. First, housing prices in first-tier cities - vast metropolitan areas such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou (capital of Guangdong province) - are rising rapidly. At the same time, a growing consumer class is spending more and more on products that, frankly, are junk,"" she said. However, some of these people have caught on to the fact that often the most expensive, attractive aspect of the home is the property itself, Zhou said. ""This actually shows that the newfound interest in the Japanese principles of paring down one's belongings and revealing space has come at exactly the right time,"" she said. ""Second, although increased consumer power coupled with the convenience of online shopping has encouraged a multitude of material possessions, for some people this trend has reached saturation point."" Against the rising tide of cheap furniture, TVs and domestic appliances, the notion of practicing minimalism proves highly seductive. ""Third, the deeper concepts behind home organization attract educated, middle-class Chinese who are uninspired by the blind materialism of the country's predominant consumer culture,"" Zhou said. Even though minimalism has always advocated reduced consumption, the concept has helped spawn many new business opportunities in China. Yang Zhihua, who set up a ""training camp"" for minimalism in 2015, recruited thousands of people in China to practice living with fewer items; Carrie Yu and Joe Harvey opened a store in Beijing called the Bulk House to promote maximizing the use of existing items and a zero-waste lifestyle; while Lin Xun started a company to help simplify people's social networking and to unclutter their ""emotional waste"". Zhou said, ""I think Marie Kondo should now set her sights on China as her next market."" She added that the trend toward minimalism is attracting attention worldwide - and, in China at least, is diversifying into new and interesting forms likely to prove lucrative to more business for a long time to come."
0,"XINING - Every morning, Sonam Tsering, 30, takes up his backpack and earphones, boards the subway and arrives at a commercial bank in Beijing for work. Sonam's job in is the international business unit of the bank. His success has a lot to do with his educational background. Sonam was born in Jone county in Gannan Tibetan autonomous prefecture of Gansu province. Under China's ethnic policies, Sonam was able to study at a middle school in northern Hebei province. ""There were many ethnic classes in our school, and many of my classmates were ethnic minorities,"" he said. After graduation, Sonam went for further study in Britain. ""I am from a small town, but education truly broadened my horizons,"" he said. Over the past decades, favorable policies have brought benefits to many children in Tibetan areas. Sonam likes watching NBA games in his spare time. Fluent in Chinese, Tibetan and English, he is also a fan of Tibetan rap and occasionally hangs out with friends at a bar in downtown Beijing. When he was studying abroad, he met the love of his life. Now both Sonam and his wife work in Beijing while raising a daughter, who is now a year old. ""We plan to let our child study in Beijing,"" he said. ""We want her to get in touch with avant-garde thoughts, broaden her horizons and pursue a life she likes,"" he said. Like Sonam Tsering, Tsering Lhakyi also benefited from the country's ethnic policies. In the 1980s, due to a lack of skilled workers and the poor educational foundation in the Tibet autonomous region, the government decided to offer classes to Tibetan children. In 1985, the first batch of them went inland to study. Since then, an increasing number have pursued studies in more developed areas in China. Tsering Lhakyi, born in the 1990s, was raised in Tibet's Nagchu prefecture. Because of her high scores in the primary school, she was admitted to an inland Tibetan middle school. After the national college entrance exam, she applied to a university in Yantai, Shandong province, because she ""wanted to see the sea"". ""The inland class truly taught me a lot about many new things,"" she said. As a fan of music, Tsering was once a singer in a bar and released two singles in Tibetan. In 2017, she went on a popular talent show called Sing! China and became a sensation in the music industry thanks to her unique style of music. Before Tsering, there were no other Tibetan contestants on the show, she said. ""People thought Tibetan singers were all about ethnic music, but I wanted to break that stereotype,"" she said. Liu Hua, with Qinghai's Ethnic and Religious Affairs Committee, said China's favorable ethnic policies not only brought quality education to students in ethnic areas but also changed their lives. ""These graduates are using their wide range of knowledge and images to influence people around them and generations to come,"" Liu said. Xinhua"
1,"BEIJING - Chinese Vice Premier Han Zheng on Thursday urged more efforts to promote the integrated and coordinated development of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei. Han, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, made the remarks while presiding over a meeting. Han called for new breakthroughs in the planning and construction of Xiongan New Area and Beijing subcenter in Tongzhou, ecological environment protection, and co-construction and sharing of basic public services in Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei. Efforts should be made to relocate the non-capital functions of Beijing in an active, proper and orderly manner, he said. He stressed high-quality and high-standard planning and development of the Xiongan New Area, and quality in the construction of the sub-center in Beijing. He also urged intensified efforts to accelerate infrastructure construction in the area such as auxiliary projects of the Beijing Daxing International Airport which is set to open in 2019. The country initiated a key strategy in 2014 to coordinate the development of Beijing, its neighboring port city Tianjin, and Hebei Province -- a regional city cluster called ""Jing-jin-ji."" A prominent task of the ""Jing-jin-ji"" strategy is to move the non-capital functions out of Beijing to treat ""urban ills"" in the Chinese capital, such as traffic jams and pollution. In April 2017, China announced the establishment of the Xiongan New Area, which, about 100 km southwest of Beijing, spans three counties in Hebei."
0,"Classic theater productions' adaptations are inevitably compared with the originals－for better or for worse. This perhaps explains the mixed reviews of contemporary director Meng Jinghui's take on Teahouse, based on the original by novelist and playwright Lao She (1899-1966)－a household name in China. Some say it's difficult to understand since the script departs so much from the original. Meng considers it ""a spiritual visit to Lao She"". Over 1,000 people attended the premiere at the Grand Theater in Zhejiang province's Wuzhen town on Oct 18. Lao She wrote Teahouse in 1956. Beijing People's Art Theater debuted the work in 1958, and the play is still one of its most popular. It depicts changes experienced by all walks of life during the final years of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), and the periods that follow, including the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression (1931-45) and New China's founding in 1949. Meng swaps the Yutai Teahouse's traditional architecture for a steel wheel that's 19 meters long, 16 meters wide and 11 meters high. It was created by set designer Zhang Wu, who has collaborated with Meng on over 30 plays, and is meant to symbolize each character's fate over time. Film actor Wen Zhang plays the teahouse's boss, Wang Lifa. Meng's three-hour play opens with Wang and 17 other performers clad in white tops and black pants giving monologues in turn as they sit on the wheel. Musician Shao Yanpeng and Beijing-based rock band Nova Heart composed the music, featuring elements of rock, electronica and hiphop for Meng's Teahouse.,""It is an artist's most basic right to adapt classics into contemporary theater,"" Meng says. ""A classic play isn't a museum exhibit. It should be kept alive and it should continue to evolve. It's an aesthetic adventure for audiences."" Meng, a 53-year-old Beijing native and Central Academy of Drama graduate, has staged more than 40 works, including Rhinoceros in Love, Two Dogs, To Live and Amber. His avant-garde, critical and humorous style is said to have enabled him to bring new vitality to Chinese theater. He adapted Chinese writer Yu Hua's acclaimed novel, To Live, into a three-hour play of the same title in 2012. The director adapted The Four Dreams by Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) playwright Tang Xianzu in 2016. Meng first read the script of Teahouse as a university student and later watched the play at the Capital Theater. He also saw movies, TV dramas and books based on the work. Meng worked with German dramaturg Sebastian Kaiser to not only adapt Teahouse into a contemporary context but also to generate a dialogue between Chinese and German artists. ""We spent six months reading the original texts of the play by Lao She before we started the rehearsals,"" Kaiser says. ""We also visited the museum of Lao She and the Lao She Teahouse in Beijing. It was an exciting process. We decided not to be intimidated by the classic play, which is like a big mountain in front of us. It's like a journey of seeking direction."" Some might say that adaptations destroy the classic play, but what they did was to show respect for a theater heritage, he says. ""It is a salute to Lao She."",Kaiser says he kept asking Meng and the Chinese actors about the play's characters and lines. The dramaturg also asked himself questions－like, ""Who is my favorite character?""－and realized the answers constantly change. ""We tried to understand Lao She, to understand Teahouse and to discover the meanings that were not shown to the audience,"" Kaiser says. Teahouse was staged at the Wuzhen Grand Theater from Oct 18 to Monday at the ongoing Sixth Wuzhen Theater Festival, which Meng co-founded. The festival, which runs through Sunday, features 109 performances of 29 plays from 17 countries. Other classic plays adapted by international theater companies are running in Wuzhen, including Anton Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard, staged by Tianjin People's Art Theater, and Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot, performed by Radu Stanca National Theatre from Romania. Teahouse will be staged at the Hangzhou Grand Theater from Wednesday to Nov 3, before it tours other Chinese cities, including Shanghai and Beijing."

The Chengdu Panda Asian Gourmet Festival will draw representatives of famous restaurants, chefs, food writers and researchers from Thailand, Singapore, Israel, Pakistan, South Korea, Japan and Turkey. Zhang Yingming, head of the office of the festival's planning committee, said the festival will consist of an international food culture exhibition, a Chinese menu and food-related exhibition and an international culinary forum. Participants will taste traditional Sichuan food, as well as delicacies from different parts of the world, he said. The festival is part of the Conference on Dialogue of Asian Civilizations to be held in Beijing in late May. In early May, Chengdu Radio and Television will invite the 16 million people who live in the city to vote online for which traditional Sichuan dishes will be included in the menu for the first banquet for overseas guests. It will broadcast the ingredients of each dish, how each is made and the story behind the dish. Sichuan is one of the best-known styles of Chinese cuisine and boasts some 3,000 dishes. People from outside the province tend to link Sichuan cuisine with spicy food and hotpot, but the province has many dishes that are not spicy, said Li Zhiqiang, a restaurant owner in Chengdu. Zhang, who is also a deputy chief of the publicity department of the Chengdu municipal committee of the Communist Party of China, the country's first exhibition of menus and recipes will be held at the festival. The exhibition will showcase cuisine from Sichuan and Guangdong provinces and from Beijing and Shanghai that were used from the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) to the 1980s."

Slated to kick off on April 29, the 162-day expo is poised to impress an expected number of 16 million visitors from home and abroad with a huge collection of plants, flowers and eye-catching pavilions as well as ideas for green development. More than 110 countries and international organizations as well as over 120 non-official exhibitors have confirmed participation, marking the highest attendance in the expo's history. The exhibitors will vie to present their latest achievements in floriculture in the 503-hectare expo site at the foot of the Great Wall in Beijing's Yanqing district. At the center of the expo site stands the Chinese Pavilion, a curved exhibition hall in the shape of ""ruyi,"" a traditional Chinese ornament symbolizing good fortune. As one of the expo's four main pavilions, it will display a wide variety of plant species from across China and showcase the history of Chinese gardening and horticulture. The design of the Chinese Pavilion echoes the expo's theme ""live green, live better."" With most of its earth-sheltered structure embedded in man-made terrace fields, both heat and humidity will be well preserved, said Jing Quan with the China Architecture Design and Research Group. The rainwater collection system on the pavilion's steel roof and a storage pond underground will be used for terrace field irrigation, Jing said, adding that more than 1,000 photovoltaic glass panels have been installed on the roof to utilize solar energy. Such exquisite designs are also found in other main pavilions such as the International Pavilion featuring 94 pillars in the shape of flower umbrella and the butterfly-shaped, multicolored Guirui Theater which will host the expo's opening and closing ceremonies. China's 31 provincial-level regions as well as Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan will showcase their iconic cultural elements in outdoor exhibit areas, such as the giant panda-themed garden set up by Sichuan province, miniature Mogao Grottoes by Gansu province and a model of ancient Tibetan village house by Tibet autonomous region. The spotlight will also be on more than 40 gardens and pavilions built by international exhibitors and branded with each country's unique culture and history. Designed to show the quintessence of Japanese gardening, the Japan garden features a lovely courtyard dotted with trees, flowers, rocks, cascades and bamboo walls. The Azerbaijan Pavilion is modeled on a seashell, which symbolizes the country's ""dynamism and passion for development and innovation,"" said Narmin Jarchalova, director of the pavilion. Besides Azerbaijan's native plants, the pavilion will display the country's traditional handmade carpets and photos of its landmarks, Jarchalova said, adding that a pomegranate tree, ""a national symbol that embodies prosperity and fertility,"" has been planted beside the pavilion. ""The Beijing expo will serve as a platform for participating countries to showcase their distinctive cultures,"" said Jiao Yutong with the Beijing International Horticultural Exhibition Coordination Bureau. ""It will also provide countries with the opportunity to further cooperate in horticulture and agriculture."" Tim Briercliffe, secretary general of the International Association of Horticultural Producers, said the Beijing expo would ""attract many visitors to learn about the importance of greening and plants in their lives."" ""The expo provides an exciting opportunity to demonstrate to the world the latest thinking and new ideas on how plants and landscapes can make lives better,"" he said."
0,"BEIJING -- With an orange alert for air pollution in place for the last two days, Beijing has adopted a raft of emergency measures to meet the smog challenge head-on. On Sunday, the city's housing and urban-rural development authorities investigated over 2,000 construction sites and 62 sites that did not meet the standards required to improve their pollution controls. The city's transport authorities punished 3,078 cases of illegal operation of trucks carrying construction materials, and 1,556 high-emission vehicles planning to enter Beijing were convinced to return back. Beijing Municipal Environmental Monitoring Center said the capital will see pollution peak on Monday, and air quality is expected to improve from Tuesday night under the influence of a cold front. Last week, the Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP) forecast that Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei and their neighboring regions would see slight to severe air pollution from Nov. 4 to 8. An orange alert, the second highest level for air pollution, was enacted on Nov. 4 simultaneously in Beijing and Tianjin, and some cities in Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong and Henan provinces. Under the orange alert, the cities are encouraged to take various measures to curb pollution, such as restricting the use of vehicles, increasing pollution controls at construction sites, removing from roads trucks transporting construction materials, and reducing or stopping production at some companies. Air quality usually worsens in late autumn and winter in northern China due in part to less wind and increased emissions from heating sources. Liaoning Province in northeast China started heating supply on Nov. 1. The provincial capital Shenyang strengthened supervision of heating supply companies and asked them to avoid operating boilers in peak hours. The city has also added 1,350 new clean energy buses to its roads this winter. China has channeled more work into improving air quality in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area by measures such as replacing dirtier coal use and penalizing polluters. Inspection teams have been dispatched to cities identified as sources of pollution and companies in breach of emission rules, according to the MEP. In 2017, Beijing plans to decrease coal use by helping residents at 700 villages adopt clean energy, removing 300,000 vehicles from roads, and shutting down 500 factories. In August, China published an action plan about air pollution governance of Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei and neighboring regions in autumn and winter from 2017 to 2018. According to the plan, from October 2017 to March 2018, the average PM2.5 density in the concerning areas is expected to drop by over 15 percent year-on-year. According to the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, the capital city's average PM2.5 density dropped to 60 micrograms per cubic meter in the first three quarters of this year, down 3.2 percent compared with the same period last year, and down 34.8 percent compared with 2013."

As one of the China Youth Volunteer Academy activities for child safety and health, the charity show emphasized child safety as its theme.The Declaration on the Rights of the Child of The United Nations says: ""Human beings should give children the best things that they have."" This call reflects the conscience and the sense of responsibility the healthy growth of the next generation. For our children, safety is the most important and valuable demand.,Through this event, the Grow with Charity group addressed the knowledge of protecting children's health by staging a play based on the well-known classic story  and guided children to establish good self-protection skills, hygiene and environmental protection as well as to understand the concept of being safe and healthy. The event helped the children build basic safety knowledge by sharing common-sense messages, such as not opening the door for strangers or accepting food from strangers.,During the event, Wang Jianyi, a student from Tuanjiehu Second Primary School in Chaoyang District, Beijing, took the stage as a representative for young volunteers, and shared his public experience with the safety and health of children in Shanxi. ""Nineteen volunteers and I delivered charity packages to students in the primary school at Gou Hong Kou center. When they took the charity packages from us, I saw their hands were so dark and dirty. It made me think how unhealthy it is if all this goes into their bodies along with food. Also, I had thought of my grandparents, my parents and my beloved teachers who always remind me that ‘disease enters by the mouth’ and ‘wash your hands before dinner’. This ‘nagging’ from them is all full of love."",The children in the audience listened carefully to what Wang Jianyi shared, and reflected the care and love through their eyes for left-behind children."

They will play a range of roles, from translation to giving directions and finding logistical loopholes - even simulating visitors' experiences. The volunteers comprise the first group of the total 20,000 volunteers to be enlisted during the expo, which is set to run from April 29 to Oct 7 in Beijing, according to Dai Bin, head of the volunteer department of the expo's coordination bureau. The opening ceremony will take place on April 28 at the Guirui Theater, the butterfly-shaped stadium in the 503-hectare expo park in Yanqing district. Multiple rehearsals and internal testing of the entire site will be rolled out with the help of the volunteers, he said. ""Most volunteers are college students majoring in agriculture, forestry, telecommunications, foreign languages and media, and the majority have had previous volunteer experience,"" Dai said. ""Together with expo workers, the volunteers will conduct trial runs to locate and fix possible flaws before the expo officially kicks off,"" he said, adding that they will also step in to assist with guiding, first aid and live broadcasting. ""Though English will dominate most of our translation services, we have also taken in volunteers fluent in eight other foreign languages, including Russian, French, Spanish and Arabic, to accommodate the needs of more international tourists,"" he said. Since the recruitment drive for expo volunteers was launched in January, more than 10,000 applications have been received via face-to-face consultations and by phone, and about 15,000 applicants have signed up online, the bureau said. Most online application portals will remain open until late September. To ensure that successful applicants - mostly college students with homework and classes - will receive appropriate and efficient training, Dai said, technology has been used to cut down on the number of large gatherings. ""We have adopted short videos and cartoon clips, along with the conventional method of presenting information in slides and text to prepare our teams,"" Dai said. Dong Jinhang, a senior majoring in ornamental horticulture at Beijing Forestry University, will begin a two-week volunteer stint at the expo later this month. She appreciated the combination of offline sessions and digital tutorials for training. ""I was able to meet and connect with experienced volunteers who shared valuable, real-life experience with us,"" she said. ""Meanwhile, I can always watch the training videos during my leisure time to reinforce my memory and basic knowledge of the venues and exhibitions."" Experienced volunteer Chen Wenting, 44, from Zhangjiakou in Hebei province, said, ""I am now fully prepared to channel my enthusiasm into the work to ensure the smooth operation of the international event."""
1,"Planners are seeking public opinion on an intercity railway linking Beijing and Xiongan New Area in North China's Hebei province, which revealed that a new high-speed rail line is being planned between the two cities. China Railway Design Corp (CRDC), a subsidiary of China Railway Corp, released an announcement last week seeking public comment till Thursday on the Gu'an East Railway Station and Bazhou North Railway Station in Langfang, North China's Hebei province, that would be built along the new line, according to the website of the People's Government of Langfang Municipal. The announcement said the intercity line will start at Liying Railway Station in Beijing's Daxing district, pass through Beijing's new airport and Langfang and terminate at Xiongan Railway Station in Xiongxian county. It's been said that the line will be put into use in 2019, which is also when the capital's new airport in Beijing's southern Daxing District is expected to open, according to Beijing News. It also said a single trip from Beijing to Xiongan on the line will be cut to about 30 minutes by then. About a month ago, China Railway Corp invited domestic and foreign design enterprises to submit first-class architectural designs for the Xiongan Railway Station. It said the station, covering about 100,000 square meters, will be a modern transportation hub to satisfy people's needs and provide high-quality public services."

He returned to China and devoted himself to his motherland, the first Chinese student to graduate from a US college, or ""Father of Chinese Overseas Students"". At that time, he would have never expected that a school would be named after him more than half and a century later. Dehong, a new sister school of Dulwich College International schools, used the Chinese character ""hong"" from his name to show the great respect to the patriot. And two of the school's four houses were named after Rong and another great Chinese woman Soong Ching Ling.,The school aims to cultivate Chinese children to be bi-lingual with critical thinking and creativity, which will prepare them well to live and work bi-culturally. During Dehong's briefing session held in Beijing on Saturday, Jing Yao, school development director of Dulwich College Beijing, introduced both the long history of Dulwich and the new vision of its new member Dehong. ""Students are the core in the educational system of Dulwich. We always put students in the first place and give the best things to them. You can find that it is the art works that were displayed around our campus, rather than the school's own achievements,"" Jing said. ""What we can bring to our students is the judgment of our daily work. And Dehong implants the same philosophy that children come first."",Lesley Meyer, education director of Dehong, said the new school intends to cultivate children as good people with nice characters, not just armed with knowledge. According to Meyer's presentation at the briefing, there will be curriculums that will teach students about the relation between nature and human, taking care of environment and applying the concept of sustainability into their lives. While Dehong Shanghai opened in 2017, its school in Beijing will officially start its first semester in next September."
1,"The New Area, covering Xiongxian, Rongcheng and Anxin counties in Hebei Province, is about 100 kilometers south of Beijing. In April, the central government announced plans for the New Area, which will facilitate the coordinated development of Beijing and the surrounding region. According to plans recently approved by the State Administration of Cultural Heritage, archaeologists will carry out detailed prospecting and trial excavation in the initial development zone, officials of the Hebei cultural heritage bureau said. Archaeologists have also finished the survey of heritage sites within the 200 square km medium-term development zone of the Xiongan New Area, and compiled plans for their protection, the officials said. Among the most important findings were the Nanyang Ruins, the remains of an ancient city dating back to the East Zhou Dynasty (770-221 BC). Using laser mapping technology, archaeologists will continue survey of the medium-term development zone in 2018, the officials said. The Xiongan New Area may eventually cover an area of 2,000 square km, according to the official plan. Archaeological survey of the whole area will begin soon, added the officials. The history of Xiongan dates back to the Neolithic Age 10,000 years ago. Bronzeware and pottery were unearthed in the Nanyang Ruins, which have been put under national cultural heritage protection."
1,"A Sunday without brunch is incomplete, said Jarrod Verbiak, head chef of Bistrot B, a French restaurant in a high-end hotel in Beijing. The restaurant's Sunday brunch for families is served at a well-decorated garden terrace. The menu includes Gillardeau oyster, New Zealand cambarus, and Italy's Prosciutto di Parma ham. These are accompanied by wines and cocktails. For those with the sweet tooth, unlimited freshly baked chocolate cake and multi-flavor ice cream are part of the deal. ""With our special menu, we want families and friends enjoy their pleasant weekend here,"" Verbiak said. The Sunday brunch can set one back by 450 yuan ($66). A premium version of the brunch, complete with Alaskan king crab, is priced 1,200 yuan. Jan Stoverink, executive assistant manager of food and beverages at Rosewood Beijing, the hotel that offers the Sunday brunch, said that numerous consumers come to eat at the hotel. ""Approximately 85 percent of the guests come from outside. They are not guests staying in the hotel."" Asked why people prefer to eat at restaurants in hotels, Stoverink said: ""Hotels not only maintain the features of restaurants like frequent product updates, innovative dishes and operating efficiency, they also use high-quality food materials, hire excellent chefs, maintain strict food safety standards, offer considerate service and present a decent environment. It is hard to maintain all these characteristics at stand-alone restaurants."" Besides, hotels such as Rosewood Beijing offer personalized service. Consumers can order what is not on the menu. They can even buy a totally customized meal. According to a joint report from the China Cuisine Association and CCTV's financial news channel, the country's catering sales reached 3.96 trillion yuan in 2017, up 10.7 percent year-on-year. The report said consumers are seeking high-quality catering experiences now. When choosing restaurants, they care most about the environment, and then the taste. The price factor only ranks fourth among their considerations. ""Consumers look for high-end consumption environment and experience. They want to eat good food in a pleasant environment, demonstrating upgraded consumption demand,"" said the report. ""Eating at the hotels has gradually become a high-end lifestyle for residents in first-tier cities. More and more city dwellers are willing to come to hotels to have a higher-quality dining experience,"" said Stoverink. Catering in first-tier cities is showing a trend of younger consumers (those born in the 1980s and 1990s) driving the change. ""I often spend over 1,000 yuan per week eating out. Sometimes we go to high-end hotels for a meal. I like the comfortable environment, which makes me feel relaxed,"" said Harry Hu, 25, a media professional in Beijing. Stoverink said the catering sector is expanding rapidly. ""Up to 50 percent of our hotel's revenue comes from food and beverages. The catering consumption in first-tier cities demonstrates diversity and variation, and the consumption scenario is turning concrete and fragmented. With these features, the market potential in first-tier cities is easy to be developed."" Zhao Ping, director of the international trade research department of the Academy of China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, said: ""Currently, retail sales growth of consumer goods is experiencing a slowdown, as demonstrated by the consumption structure that is shifting from commodity consumption to service consumption. Consumption figures in education, culture, entertainment, sports and tourism all maintained double-digit growth. ""In the first half of this year, food consumption took up only 29.3 percent of residents' expenditure on average, while education, culture and entertainment accounted for 9.2 percent, representing a higher ratio. With people's income going up, they are more willing to buy high-end products, and want to have spiritual satisfaction, rather than crass consumption. This depicts consumption upgrade."""
1,"HANGZHOU－As the World Internet Conference wraps up its fifth year in the river town of Wuzhen, East China's Zhejiang province, technology once seen as far-fetched flights of fancy are trickling out into peoples' everyday lives and fueling China's nascent digital boom. Held from Nov 7 to 9 in Wuzhen, this year's conference aimed to advocate exchanges, mutual learning, cooperation and sharing in the digital fields, and to push for peace and development in global cyberspace. ""As we can feel in Wuzhen, China's digitalization is speeding up and the town is becoming more and more international,"" Pony Ma, chairman and CEO of Tencent Group, told participants at the conference's opening ceremony on Wednesday. ""It's fair to say that Wuzhen has become an epitome of China's booming internet industry,"" said Ma. About 1,500 guests from 76 countries and regions, including government representatives, heads of international organizations, leading figures of internet companies, online celebrities, experts and scholars, attended the conference. ""To many, retired elderly people are supposed to sit quietly while reminiscing about their old days, but the internet has changed everything,"" said Wuzhen resident Hu Hui. By sharing dressing tips, square dance classes and performing Shaoxing Opera with fans, the 80-year-old senior citizen has gained about 10,000 views on the Chinese video-sharing app Douyin. Many of her neighbors are also enjoying a youthful lifestyle－shopping online, paying with smartphones and sharing their daily life on live streaming platforms. As are conference attendees. Face-scanning technology has replaced the gate pass. While guests can check-in at the Binzhi AI Hotel by only swiping their ID card and scanning their face. In this digital town, some of the latest technological innovations, once viewed as the stuff of science fiction, are becoming reality. At the Light of Internet Expo held during the WIC, a model demonstrated how grocery stores can operate without cashiers. Cameras, powered by visual identification technology by ArcSoft Inc, identify fruit chosen by customers, allowing them to grab goods and checkout on their own. Visionox Co demonstrated a foldable smartphone with two 7.2-inch flexible screens that can be flipped open like a book, or folded to fit into a pocket. Chinese tech giant Baidu Inc also showcased its newly developed self-driving bus named Apolong at the expo. With no need for a human driver, the bus is able to smoothly navigate roads, while avoiding pedestrians and other vehicles. The inside of the vehicle resembles an entertainment room where passengers can watch movies, sing karaoke and enjoy a carefree ride. The bus began mass production in July and has been put into operation in semi-en-closed and enclosed areas, such as scenic areas and industrial parks, in Beijing, Xiamen in Fujian province and other Chinese cities. ""I see tens of thousands of self-driving vehicles running on connected roads in the future,"" said Zhang Yaqin, president of Baidu. ""This will bring fundamental changes to the relationship between men, vehicles and cities."" Looking to connect them all is the world's largest telecommunications equipment manufacturer Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, which used Wuzhen to demonstrate its latest 5G technology. The conference also brought news of the sizeable boom China's digital economy is going through, with the release of the World Internet Development Report 2018 and China Internet Development Report 2018 on Thursday morning. In 2017, the size of China's digital economy grew to 27.2 trillion yuan ($3.9 trillion), accounting for 32.9 percent of the nation's GDP, up 2.6 percentage points on the previous year. In all, the booming digital economy contributed about 55 percent to the country's GDP growth in 2017. As of December 2017, China has a total of 102 listed internet enterprises at home and abroad, up 12 percent year-on-year. As of June, the number of China's netizens reached 802 million, among which 788 million are mobile phone users. The reports also found that the volume of information consumption more than doubled, from 2.2 trillion yuan in 2013 to 4.5 trillion yuan in 2017, with year-on-year growth of 20 percent. ""In the last five years, we've seen China move into the heart of the digital economy, not just in numbers, but also with innovation,"" said Fadi Chehade, senior consultant to the executive chairman of the World Economic Forum. The conference on Wednesday unveiled the top 15 latest global scientific and technological achievements, selected by a committee of 40 Chinese and foreign experts from about 400 entries. Among them are WeChat mini-programs from Tencent Group, an artificial intelligence processor from Huawei, the intelligent cybersecurity protection system from the 360 Group, and an AI open platform for smart homes from Xiaomi. ""Digital economy means an open economy. It has no future without opening-up. China views the digital economy as a common opportunity for global development,"" said Zhuang Rongwen, director of the Cyberspace Administration of China and deputy director of the State Council Information Office. ""We are willing to deepen cooperation with other countries to further promote the digital economy, and achieve greater development through cross-border e-commerce and open markets,"" Zhuang said."
0,"This is not an easy story to tell, and contains many details I'm generally embarrassed (尴尬) to reveal. Underlying the story is the fact that, for many years, I actively rejected my Chinese cultural heritage as ""foreign,"" something I thought (and was told) I should leave behind and permanently reject if I ever was to conform to my birth culture. I am telling this story because I know there are many individuals like myself, Chinese born in countries all across the world, who have grown up ""between a rock and a hard place,"" never seeming to meet the cultural expectations of our birth culture but also struggling to carry forth the thoughts, beliefs, and practices of our parent culture.  Rather than forcing ourselves to choose between one culture over the other or self-identifying as ""bananas"" (Chinese on the outside, but not on the inside), I believe we should instead submit to our unique cultural hybridity and seek to appreciate both respective cultures. Furthermore, I believe as cultural go-betweens, we have an important role to play in spreading Chinese culture both in the Mainland and in the rich Diasporas in which we reside.  Looking back, it is impossible for me to pinpoint the exact moment where I transitioned from a ""Canadian"" into a ""Chinese-Canadian.""  What I know for certain is that it has been and continues to be a lifelong journey of learning, one that began in the classroom of a Migration History professor and one that continues as I intern in Shanghai over this summer. I can pinpoint, however, many moments along that journey where I felt particularly attached to my motherland: staring out at the West Lake in Hangzhou, getting lost in the Old Summer Palace in Beijing, admiring the beauty of Guilin’s natural scenery, and crowding into a locals-only   (小笼包) store in Shanghai.    My early University days, more specifically my decision to study the liberal arts, join a Fraternity and move out for a year were influenced by my attempts to reject my cultural upbringing. I would account a large part of my change of heart and my transition to a ""Chinese-Canadian"" to three major events: 1) Registering for an Asian Migration History course, 2) Finding a Chinese girlfriend, and 3) Studying Chinese at UBC The Chinese-Canadian Migration History course, I took almost accidentally and with no real intention of utilizing it to better connect with my cultural roots. I was therefore surprised when one of our first assignments was to do an oral history of a fellow classmate. My partner and I both decided we would make short films, asking personal questions about each other’s family history.  At that point I knew very little bout my family; in fact, next to nothing. This was something which began to bother me. Prompted by the assignment, I began to ask my parents questions, such as ""Who were my grandparents?"" It was a question to which my mom answered briefly: ""Farmers, they were all farmers."" However, from my dad I received a much more exciting story, one for many years he had seemingly kept to himself. My late grandfather, it turns out, was a prominent Communist educator who after the Revolution was an administrator and author of many prominent textbooks. My grandmother was on the other hand, the daughter of a Nationalist army officer. It was Romeo and Juliet style love story that I might never had known if I had not asked. Under Dr. Yu’s tutelage, I became actively involved in the Chinese community in Vancouver, organizing workshops and panels aimed at solving cultural conflicts such as whether to teach Mandarin in local elementary schools. I also got to learn more about how closely connected Vancouver is to China, and how historically we made up some the earliest traders and migrants to the area (even before most Europeans had even heard of Canada). It was this continuous hunger to learn more and appreciate my identity that I took most from Dr. Yu’s class (In fact, my father and I are planning a trip to Shaoxing, Zhejiang to try and track down more of my family history later this summer) The second major development was finding a Chinese girlfriend. Actually, it was finding a girlfriend who was more Chinese than I was. She was born in China and raised in Vancouver, but her parents spoke nothing but Chinese at home. This was in stark contrast to my own household, where my parents spoke the Shanghainese dialect to each other, I spoke English to my father and sister, and I spoke some sort of ungrammatical Chinglish to my Mother.  By visiting my girlfriend’s family, I learned simple but basic things such as to ditou (低头) when addressing those older than you and to address them as nin (您) rather than ni (你)。I was forced to talk with various uncles and aunties in a language I seldom spoke by choice, asides from the basic ""I’m coming"" and ""I’m going."" During, this time my girlfriend also pressured me to watch Chinese television dramas with her, something I was at first hesitant to do because I had trouble relating to them. (Ironically, this summer I have become completely obsessed with Zhao Wei’s dramas and movies, as well as Chen Sicheng’s ""  (北京爱情故事). It is a great way to learn Mandarin.) In order to improve my language (and in order to get language requirements to graduate) I enrolled in Mandarin class during my second and third year at University. Along with calculus (go figure) they were my two lowest marks at University. I remember staring blankly at countless exams being completely unable to remember even the first stroke of the character I wanted to write. However, through all the lessons and lectures ranging from Confucius (孔子) to Chinese   Stories (成语故事), I finally began to appreciate the complexity and richness of Chinese culture. My favourite memories of Mandarin class were turning simple conversation exercises into ""over the top"" plays with music and costumes.The first time I visited China I was only four, with truthfully no recollection of my experiences. However, in 2009, I came for the first ""real"" time on a vacation with my family. We started from Beijing, where we stayed across from the Bird’s Nest（鸟巢）， Beijing stood out to me for its rich history, and the traditional feel of its hutong (胡同). Coming the year after the Olympics, it felt Beijing still had a tourist buzz to it at all of the major historical sites we visited. I remember eating Beijingnese food at a restaurant near Qianmen Street (前门街), really tasting the famous, subtle flavors of Thinly-Sliced Potato (土豆丝) for the first time in my life.    In Shanghai, we stayed in the Hongkou district, where the history of the city’s occupational past really stood out to me. Hangzhou exceeded my expectations, with the romanticism of her West Lake (西湖) and the sheer magnitude of the Leifang Pagoda and finally, at Guilin, we watched Zhang Yi-Mou’s spectacular show ""Impression Liu San Jie."" Some of my fondest, simple memories were of my daily morning runs, stopping by the local park to watch elderly men and woman dance, meditate, and play Chess late into the sweaty summer afternoon. Since 2009, I have travelled and researched in Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand and have seen in each of these regions how Chinese culture and heritage has spread. It makes me feel so proud to be Chinese.  Now, as a law student, I am trying to find ways to continue connecting with to my Chinese roots. In Canada, there are major issues affecting the Chinese-Canadian community. The foreign degrees of immigrants are often not recognized in Canada (something my parents both had to endure, as Chinese-trained doctors). Many of these immigrants resort to working at convenience stores or as taxi drivers and are not able to meet their full intellectual potential. Second, many Chinese are unable to rise to high-level positions in society (Executives, Judges, and Politicians), held back by a bamboo-ceiling created by many of the same false cultural assumptions I have faced during my life. Contrary to what is often misrepresented in Western media, Chinese culture is one of the most well-developed, respectful, innovative, and influential cultures on earth. Chinese people are some of the nicest, most filial, and family-oriented individuals I know.  As a Chinese born-overseas, I believe we have a major role in Canada to play as cultural ambassadors to help other Canadians find their Chinese hearts and better appreciate Chinese culture. In China, we can act as go-betweens by sharing our Western culture and our strengths in creativity and management to benefit Chinese society. Ultimately, a world more intertwined between cultures and between countries will be one with less conflict and more collective social responsibility. To conclude, I hope that by telling ""My Chinese Story"", I can encourage those who read it to think about their own cultural identity, and the great potential that within it and beyond the liabilities that we often attach to it."
1,"China will strengthen State-owned enterprises' mixed ownership reform, private companies' reform and property protection, said China's top economic regulator on Wednesday in Beijing, adding that it will also motivate entrepreneurship spirit and provide a better business environment in order to further promote reform. The statement was made by Lian Weiliang, deputy head of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), at a press conference for the second session of the 13th National People's Congress. Private enterprises can better engage in mixed ownership reform of State-owned enterprises by having increased access and more connectivity through higher quality reform, Lian said. In competing areas joint-stock ownership is allowed to stimulate market vitality. Shareholders legitimate interests and rights will also be better protected so that they can better exercise their duties according to the holding equities, Lian said."
0,"Beijing resident Yan Minwen, 76, spends more than 12 hours each weekend traveling to and from a village in neighboring Hebei province to give private lessons to children left in their grandparents' care. Yan began visiting Xiguanzhuang village, about 100 kilometers southwest of the capital, in March and hasn't skipped a week apart from the summer school holiday. ""I want to do something useful during retirement, and tutoring children in rural areas who lack home instruction is a good option,"" Yan said. Xiguanzhuang, in Baoding's Laishui county, was the home of Yan's grandparents, and their residential land was passed on to her when they died. On occasional visits to the village she learned that most of its young parents had gone to big cities as migrant workers to make a living, leaving their children under the care of grandparents. ""The children need instruction at home but most of their grandparents are illiterate and don't know how to help in children's education,"" Yan said. Yan studied at university and tutored her own daughter, and wanted to use that experience to do something to help. She borrowed a room in her uncle's home in Xiguanzhuang and put some secondhand desks in it. The first students began using them on March 23. Yan leaves her home in Beijing's Wangjing area at 9 am every Friday and arrives at the village around 3:30 pm after more than six hours on four different buses. ""The first two buses in Beijing are free for elderly people like me and the other two cost me a total of 11 yuan ($1.60),"" Yan said. On Friday night and Saturday, about 25 pupils gather in the room to study and do homework under Yan's guidance. ""I don't give specific lessons but instead create a good atmosphere for pupils to study and help them solve problems in homework,"" she said. The children are from different grades, ranging from primary to middle school. ""I can help deal with most of their questions in English and mathematics, but I have forgotten the knowledge of other subjects like chemistry and physics,"" she said. ""But I still have the ability to learn."" Yan also gives psychological guidance to the children. Tang Jia, a third-grade middle school student, felt under pressure before the high school entrance examination. Her mother quit her job and returned to the village to support Tang, but without much education she didn't know how to help. She learned about Yan's study group and took her daughter along to ask for help at the end of March. ""Based on the experiences of my daughter and I in exams, I told her how to prepare for them under a good psychological state and that she should give more attention to subjects she was not good at,"" Yan said. Two hours of guidance from Yan made Tang more confident and helped her achieve a good result in the exam two months later. Yan was an automation major at the University of Science and Technology Beijing from 1960 to 1965. After graduation, she became an equipment operator at a company making aluminum products. ""Now my time is divided between tutoring private pupils in the village and teaching automation in vocational colleges in Beijing, which includes online classes and face-to-face classes,"" Yan said. She began teaching part-time at vocational colleges after retiring in 1997. Yan said some of her elderly friends had told her that her retirement seemed tiring. ""It's sometimes physically tiring, but I feel it is more fulfilling,"" Yan said. ""If I didn't do these things, I would feel the loneliness and pain all the time after losing my husband."" Yan's husband died of pneumonia in August last year. ""It was the two of us who wanted to instruct village pupils when we saw a similar case on TV in 2015,"" she said. After her husband died, her daughter encouraged her to travel as a way to ease the pain. But Yan said the only thing she wanted to do was to go back to her ancestral home to fulfill the dream she shared with her husband. When the study group started in March, there were only 10 pupils in the room which measures less than 10 square meters. But the number of pupils can now reach close to 30, making the room crowded. ""With the number of pupils increasing, I plan to build a house on my grandparents' residential land that can hold at least 40 pupils,"" Yan said. She has already drawn a sketch of the house and plans to spend about 100,000 yuan from her savings and pension to build it. ""Other old people may find traveling a good choice after retirement,"" Yan said. ""Well, I have found my own way toward happiness in later life."""
0,"A sports guideline for China's preschool children aged 3-6 was published on June 9 in Beijing, specifying that daily exercises for those in the age group should be no less than 180 minutes a day in line with their physical health development. The intensity and variety of sports are two major themes in the guideline, which was jointly authorized by the Beijing Sport University, the Children's Hospital with the Capital Institute of Pediatrics, and the Sport Science Research Institute under the General Administration of Sport of China. Its contents also ranges from physical science, pediatrics, and public hygiene, aiming to improve the physical health of children across the nation when they face ever-increasing health problems such as obesity and shortsightedness. It is recommended that young people should engage in various kinds of activities during the daily 180-minute exercises, including medium-or-above intense activities no less than 60 minutes and outdoor sports for about 120 minutes a day, according to the guideline."
1,"On Friday, Fitch Ratings published China Fortune Land Development Co., Ltd.'s (CFLD) long-term foreign-currency issuer default rating (IDR) as BB+ with a stable outlook. Fitch Ratings, one of the world's top three foreign ratings agencies, also assigned BB+ ratings to CFLD (Cayman) Investment Ltd's notes as they are unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by CFLD. CFLD's ratings are supported by its leading position in the industrialization and urbanization of large districts in less developed counties in key economic regions such as the pan-Beijing region, the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta, Central China and the Sichuan-Chongqing zone, Fitch said on its website. CFLD, an industry zone developer and operator, has a unique business model differentiated from most Chinese homebuilders, strengthening its competitive advantage, Fitch added. Furthermore, domestic credit-rating agency Dagong Global Credit Rating Co maintained on May 31 both the bond credit rating and the enterprise credit rating for CFLD at AAA, with a stable outlook. CFLD's financial report in Q1 shows that CFLD's business revenue rose 21.48 percent year-on-year to more than 9.49 billion yuan, while net profit attributed to equity shareholders reached 2.29 billion yuan, up 30.33 percent from a year earlier. In recent years, CFLD has explored differentiation development strategies in various cities and established more than 80 new industry cities in Beijing and the provinces of Guangdong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Henan, as well as in Indonesia."
1,"In nine hours and at a fare of about 1,000 yuan ($146), passengers will be able to travel from Beijing to Hong Kong via the much-awaited Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong High Speed Rail when the Hong Kong section is put into use next month. The 400,000-sqm West Kowloon Station in Hong Kong is in its final stage of preparation with about 1,500 signs installed and a wide range of facilities available, according to Hong Kong-based rail transit network operator MTR Corporation. The current train journey between the capital and special administrative region takes about 24 hours, which will be slashed to about nine hours -- eight hours on the Beijing West- Guangzhou South bullet train and 48 minutes from Guangzhou to Hong Kong along the new 26 km section. A port will also be established at West Kowloon Station where the mainland and HKSAR will carry out exit and entry supervision. Passengers from Hong Kong will be able to pass through immigration inspection, customs clearance, and quarantine before taking the high-speed train to 17 destinations on the mainland. It is estimated that 109,200 passengers per day will travel between Hong Kong and the mainland during the first year of operation."
0,"All countries should create the conditions for other civilizations to develop while keeping their own civilization vibrant, President Xi Jinping said on Wednesday in Beijing. ""We should allow all civilizations of the world to fully bloom,"" Xi said in the keynote speech at the opening ceremony of the Conference on Dialogue of Asian Civilizations. Xi also said all countries should uphold equality and respect and abandon pride and prejudice to promote dialogue and harmonious coexistence among civilizations. There will be no clash of civilizations as long as people are able to appreciate the beauty of them all, he said. Xi stressed the need to ensure openness, inclusiveness and mutual learning among civilizations. He said the conference aims to create a new platform for advancing equal dialogue and mutual learning and inspiration among civilizations in Asia and the rest of the world. The conference, being held from Wednesday through May 22, has drawn more than 1,300 leaders and representatives from countries and international organizations worldwide to Beijing to work toward consensus on the benefits of a global community with a shared future. Participants in the conference, which is seen as a new starting point for greater inter-civilizational dialogue, expressed hope for Asia and the international community to conduct more extensive and in-depth interaction. Singaporean President Halimah Yacob, one of the Asian leaders who spoke at the opening ceremony, said dialogue and empathy are essential to improving understanding and trust and bridging differences.,She said Singapore, with its emphasis on racial and religious harmony, presents a microcosm of a ""larger challenge facing the world in getting people with different religions, values and backgrounds to live together harmoniously"". The conference is a good example of conducting dialogue within Asian civilizations as well as reaching out to other civilizations in the world, she said. Author and public intellectual Parag Khanna, pointing to the major issues that were set to come out of the dialogue and their importance in the current international climate, told China Daily, ""The most significant geopolitical reality of the 21st century is that we live for the first time in human history in a world that is both multipolar and multicivilizational. ""Powers of the East and West are equally influential in the world. Thus we need a new kind of understanding of how civilizations will relate to each other premised on coexistence rather than dominance,"" said Khanna, author of The Future Is Asian: Commerce, Conflict, and Culture in the 21st Century. ""Among the main obstacles are historical mindsets that presume that one power must dominate the system for it to be stable, which is false,"" he said, adding that there are many ""unique civilizations, with none more special than the others"". German Sinologist Ole Doering said the message he took from President Xi's speech was that of ""openness, that everybody should contribute what they can and try to engage in mutual learning"". Uxi Mufti, founder of the National Heritage Museum in Pakistan, said Xi ""has come up with a wonderful idea. His idea will generate cooperation, in Asia at least. The paradigm of going forward has changed. We are into an age of interdependence."" Laurence Brahm, a senior international fellow at the the Beijing think tank Center for China and Globalization, said, ""President Xi's speech set forth a fresh paradigm based on a set of universal values founded on the core heritage and culture of very ancient civilizations. ""The values of Asia are based on nonduality, harmony and synergy, while Western values are premised on the concept of duality often expressed in a zero-sum game,"" Brahm said. Other luminaries from the public and private sector also discussed related topics at various forums during the conference, while an Asian culture carnival, Asian civilization week and Asian food festival were being held in conjunction with the main event. At a forum on the global influence of Asian civilizations, Zheng Yongnian, director of the East Asian Institute at the National University of Singapore, said dialogue is the ""origin of civilization"". Chinese civilization ""also originated from dialogue"", and conflict in itself cannot produce civilization, said Zheng, whose research interests include China's transformation and its external relations. Cambodian Minister of Information Khieu Kanharith said understanding different civilizations means understanding each other to promote prosperity in a more collaborative way. ""I am very optimistic that today's meeting will form the basis of mutual understanding, thus creating a better world,"" he said."
0,"A musical inspired by ancient poetry will be staged at the ongoing Meet in Beijing Arts Festival, Chen Nan reports. Composer Zou Hang creates music in various genres, ranging from classical to rock to traditional Chinese operas. In 2008, he was one of the composers of the piano concerto, Starry Sky, which was performed by pianist Lang Lang at the opening of the Olympic Games in Beijing. In 2010 and 2011, Zou was the music director for crossover concerts by rock musician Cui Jian along with symphony orchestras. Early last year, when he was approached by producer Dai Xiaolan to write music for a musical, Zou says he wanted to give it a try although the project - inspired by a collection of Chinese poems from the 11th to the sixth centuries BC, known as Shi Jing, or Classics of Poetry - was challenging. ""Shi Jing is written in traditional Chinese, and we spent a long time working on the script,"" says Zou, adding that some words in the ancient text were even difficult to pronounce. ""Chinese words have four main tones that are rhythmic. The music has to fit the pronunciations of the lyrics, too."",Finally, the musical, entitled Shi Jing Cai Wei, or A Homesick Warrior, premiered at the Tianqiao Performing Arts Center in Beijing on Oct 20, attracting about 4,000 people. A new, revised version will run at the same venue on May 18 and 19 as part of the ongoing Meet in Beijing Arts Festival, the Chinese capital's largest annual cultural event. According to the producer, the theme of Shi Jing will be developed into a trilogy of musicals, showcasing traditional Chinese culture from different aspects, such as farming, customs and etiquette. The musical also aims to attract young audiences. Singers Li Weipeng, Jiang Shuai and Jiang Qianru play the leading roles in the musical, which tells the story of three childhood friends, one of whom grows up to become a military general. ""It is a story of sacrifice and love for family and the country,"" Zou, 44, says. Over 20 original songs have been written for the musical. They are accompanied by a symphony orchestra and traditional musical instruments, such as the pipa (four-stringed Chinese lute) and guzheng (Chinese zither). The composer calls the musical ""poetic"".,Born in Changsha, Hunan province, Zou was introduced to music by his father, Zou Shuliang, a pipa player, and it became natural for the son to use traditional music in the pieces he composed. Zou Hang learned to play the pipa with his father for 10 years before he trained classically at the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing with renowned composer Ye Xiaogang in 1993. ""The sounds of traditional musical instruments exist in my DNA,"" Zou Hang says. In 2001, he obtained a master's degree from the Central Conservatory of Music and now teaches at an affiliated middle school. Zou also fell in love with rock music as a teenager, especially after he moved to Beijing in the 1980s, when the city was regarded as a center of Chinese rock.,""Musicals are a Western art form, but when it is localized here, I want it to have distinct Chinese sounds,"" Zou Hang says, adding that he is a big fan of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musicals and the French musical, Notre-Dame de Paris, by Riccardo Cocciante. In the second chapter of Shi Jing Cai Wei, Zou also borrows dancing elements of Nuoxi, a popular folk opera in China's south and east. Originating in the 16th century as a form of totem worship, the genre features performers wearing heavy costumes and face masks, symbolizing different gods. Zou uses Chinese percussion instruments to portray the scenes of worshiping the gods and praying for the dead, especially after wars."
1,"Global media coverage of the ongoing two sessions in Beijing has taken my mind back to the pre-internet era of the early 1980s. Back then, studious high school students in India, where I come from, used to glean ""general knowledge"" from the mass media, trivia books and almanacs. The goal was to become well-informed as well as win prizes in interschool quiz and debate competitions. We enjoyed memorizing trivia. From a ""Third World"" perspective, the West seemed fascinating-and learning more about it was considered natural, even expected. So: What's the capital of the United States? Washington. What's the currency of the United Kingdom? Pound sterling. What's the lower house of the British parliament called? The House of Commons. Where's it located? Westminster. Only Japan was a bit of an exception. It wasn't the West, but we knew Tokyo was its capital and the yen its currency. There were a couple of other exceptions: Who's Malaysia's prime minister? Mahathir Mohamad. Who's the president of Cuba? Fidel Castro. Learning ""who's who"" meant we knew ""big"" names such as Ronald Reagan, Mikhail Gorbachev, Helmut Kohl and Francois Mitterrand. Back then, we knew very little about China, except that it was a large, populous, agricultural, somewhat similar ""Third World"" country that boasted the Great Wall (which, it was believed, was the only man-made structure visible from space). Except for the bit about Beijing being its capital, and Deng Xiaoping being its leader, China was by and large a known unknown. Ignorance was bliss. Not anymore. Who could have imagined that in a little over three decades, the ""knowledge"" of the West accumulated over the years would become relatively unimportant? I certainly never imagined I'd one day live and work in China. The advent of the internet and the simultaneous politico-economic rise of China have ensured that not just my generation (those born in the late '60s and early '70s), but the one that preceded us as well as the one that followed us, are all now forced to sit up, take notice, and-shall we say-cram as many details about China as quickly as possible into our individual and collective consciousness. This became obvious to me the other day when a childhood friend in India told me his college-going teenage son, like his peers, shows a deep interest in China, reads about it online and even has a question related to the two sessions: ""Why are the members of the National People's Congress referred to as 'deputies' and not 'members of parliament', or 'MPs', as they are called in India, or 'lawmakers', like in the US?"" It may seem like a trivial question. But given my familiarity with trivia, it also represented the level of interest the world now has in China. It indicated why everyone wants to know more, not less, about China. It also underlined the need for the country's leading institutions, such as the Communist Party of China, the top legislature and the central and local governments, to better engage with the rest of the world in order to quench the seemingly unquenchable thirst for information, news and views on China. In October, the Party held its 19th National Congress. And now the world is riveted by the ongoing two sessions. It would be folly to attribute this curiosity to what appears to be the inevitable rise of the Chinese economy to global prominence. There's more going on here, I'd argue. Ordinary people across the world, empowered by technology that enables access to real-time information are looking for alternatives to failed or dubious systems of governance. You could say it's part of the process of the evolution of public consciousness itself. For a long time, developing nations were enamored with the West and bought into its media outlets' spin. Now, it seems, consumers of content are no longer sure if they should accept such messages and value systems at face value. The reality is, while the world is overwhelmed by the exhumed incidents of gender inequality and sexual discrimination, and convulses through""#MeToo"" hashtags, China's legislature reveals its liberal, modern fabric: 742 of the total 2,980 deputies, or 25 percent, are women. The reality is, the so-called democracies have seen their parliaments, allegedly their supreme institutions, failing to shake themselves free from the vice-like grip of lobbyists of planet-pillaging, tax-evading corporations. They have seen outright criminals becoming lawmakers. They have seen lawmakers failing to enact laws to rein in the gun culture that enables shootings of innocents ad nauseam. They have also seen their august legislatures become venues for violence, stalling or rollback of reforms, and attempts to reverse, circumvent or disregard the will of the people expressed via referendums. Around the same time, the world is also seeing in China a national legislature that actually performs-it communicates its intent, and ensures the government delivers on its promises. When the world wonders if China could be trusted on a plethora of issues, the Government Work Report shows that every year there is a lot going on-opening-up, supply-side reforms, innovation initiatives, robust protection for intellectual property rights-to warrant a rethink. An open-minded world is looking for answers to vexing problems. People everywhere are questioning received wisdom-is it really wise to replace a wise president with someone arguably less so because the law forbids the former from continuing in office as he has already served the maximum two terms? Should we change the law? Or, should we uphold the law (and elect a joker next because that's the choice a democracy inflicts on us)? Such profound conundrums are boggling the world. China appears to have ignited the world's imagination with its distinct, flexible and arguably practical approach to such dilemmas."
0,"More Chinese are warming up to the idea of chilling out in the snow as market for on-piste action and apres-ski entertainment booms. Destinations covered in ice and snow no longer get a chilly reception from Chinese travelers as demand for winter tourism continues to grow. Since Beijing won its bid to host the 2022 Winter Olympics in 2015, the Beijing-based China Tourism Academy reports that the country's winter tourism business has taken off. Chinese travelers made approximately 197 million visits to venues and locations offering cold weather activities during the winter of 2017-18, a year-on-year increase of 16 percent, the Academy's report shows. During that same period, winter tourism generated revenues of about 330 billion yuan ($47.9 billion), up 22 percent year-on-year. Travelers are also increasingly spending more time at their winter destinations, with trips lasting, on average, about three days during the 2017-18 winter period. Skiing is the most popular activity, with ski resorts accounting for 60 percent of the market nationwide. The academy forecasts that the number of tourists will reach 340 million in the 2021-22 winter tourism season, with revenue from the sector reaching 680 billion yuan. ""Winter tourism products are increasingly diverse now, and the search for ski, sleigh, ice sculpture and aurora is growing,"" Alibaba's travel arm, Fliggy, notes.,The number of Fliggy users searching for winter getaways surged 48 percent in 2018, compared with the previous year, while inquires for winter activities have quadrupled at Tuniu, a major domestic travel agency headquartered in eastern Jiangsu province. Tuniu expects its winter customers to grow by 30 percent year-on-year during the 2018-19 season. ""Splendid ice-snow landscapes and scenery, as well as lush folk customs in such areas, have both become important attractions for winter tourism,"" says Li Qiuyan, an official with the online travel agency Lvmama. The company's winter package bookings more than doubled month-on-month during November and December. Those from eastern and southern cities, such as Shanghai, Guangdong province's Shenzhen and Guangzhou, Zhejiang province's Hangzhou and Fujian province's Xiamen, have all shown great enthusiasm for winter tourism, Li says. Northeastern Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning provinces remain the most popular winter tourism destinations in China, according to Tuniu. Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region's Urumqi and Altay prefecture have also drawn increasing attention from winter travelers for their traditional folk customs, such as winter fishing and horse racing. Provinces across the country have promoted new themed activities with cheaper prices, offering discounts to tourist attractions, flights and subsidies to travel agencies to woo winter vacationers. Northwestern Gansu province has launched winter tourism programs featuring Silk Road gourmet food and landscape scenery to appeal to travelers from far and wide. Gansu abounds in historical sites and natural and ethnic elements, and is known as the birthplace of the Chinese civilization. Free and discounted tickets to major scenic spots in Gansu will be offered during the winter period until the end of March, and top-rated restaurants are also offering preferential rates.,In Xinjiang, at a winter-tourism festival in the region's capital, Urumqi, and a winter-industry expo in Altay, more than 130 tourism activities have been staged since Oct 14, many of which will also continue through March. Travelers can explore the wilderness on a horse-drawn sleigh or by helicopter at the Altay Mountain Wild Snow Park, while hot air balloon flights, ethnic Kazak folk performances and rime festivals in Koktokay. Rime is white ice that forms when water droplets in fog freeze to the outer surfaces of objects, such as trees and is feathery and milky in appearance, creating stunning scenery. Urumqi's ancient ecology park offers opportunities for horse riders to engage with the region's equestrian culture during holidays like Spring Festival, which falls on Feb 5, and Valentine's Day, nine days later. At the same time, Xinjiang has adopted about 100 new policies to boost winter tourism. Free and discounted skiing and dining tickets will be offered at Urumqi's 20-day snow-art carnival which takes place around Spring Festival. Gifts and Xinjiang specialties at an ""agritainment"" food competition and hiking event around the capital's Grand Bazaar will be prepared, while top-grade scenic spots will offer lower winter ticket prices through March. Chartered-plane and tourism-train passengers will receive monetary incentives, as will travel agencies that bring large numbers of visitors during the winter. Heilongjiang province has also upgraded its winter tourism packages and offers custom-made tours and interactive programs. More than 300 events featuring folk celebrations and winter sports, as well more than 4,000 art performances are part of a program that runs through April, according to Zhang Lina, head of the Heilongjiang culture and tourism authority. The capital city and future host of the Winter Olympics, Beijing, as you would expect, is keen to raise the profile of winter travel and get in on the action. Therefore, it has also launched 15 tourism packages and dozens of self-drive routes to provide plenty of winter fun for local residents and tourists. The packages cover activities across a range of interests, including folk customs, winter sports, traditional Chinese medicine, hot springs, shopping and art performances.,The goal is to encourage people to experience the winter charm of the capital and popularize winter sports ahead of the 2022 winter games, says Wang Yue, deputy head of the Beijing culture and tourism authority. She says that temple visits, museum exhibitions and special park and library events would also be held during the Spring Festival. All of these are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the country's brisk development of its winter travel business. Investment in winter tourism has reached approximately 540 billion yuan during 2017-18, according to China Tourism Academy. According to UNWTO forecasts, the output value of relevant sectors, including winter sports, resorts and exhibitions, are expected to hit 2.92 trillion yuan during the 2021-22 season. Governments at various levels have increased infrastructure construction in winter destinations. The new terminal at Changchun Airport, Beijing-Zhangjiakou high-speed rail and Altay Airport have all given travelers easier access to the nation's winter wonderlands. The improving domestic winter tourism infrastructure has also turned some regions into snowcapped hot spots, says Chinese travel website Mafengwo. The ski resorts at Mount Emei and Xiling Snow Mountain have made Sichuan province a popular winter getaway, while Hubei, Zhejiang, Guizhou and Hunan provinces have all built their own winter tourism sites. Despite cold weather activities being relatively more expensive, more tourists are willing to pay for better experiences and domestic winter tourism spending broke 3,000 yuan per capita, Tuniu reports. In 2018, the purchase of ski equipment grew by 90 percent year-on-year, according to online retail platform, Tmall. ""Experiencing high-quality winter tourism will be an important theme this winter,"" Feng Rao, a senior official with Mafengwo's tourism research center, told China Tourism News. The winter tourism market is offering travelers more quality choices, she explains. ""With a series of positive supervision and standardization work by relevant departments across the country, this year's market environment and tourism services are expected to improve significantly,"" says Feng."
0,"Hip-hop is finding plenty of enthusiasts in China, who are savoring the power and energy of dance, Chen Nan reports. When Xia Rui was introduced to hip-hop culture as a freshman at Communication University of China in Beijing in 2002, he fell for the dramatically expressive street dancing immediately. By participating in dance communities of other universities, such as Peking University, and watching music videos of Michael Jackson and Madonna, Xia developed an interest in the dance style. ""At that time, few people knew what street dancing was. It was a Western culture thing, popular among university students,"" recalls Xia, now 35, who later founded a hip-hop dance community at the CUC in 2003. ""Our teachers and parents considered it as a bad influence then. But hip-hop dance, which is about skills, creativity and displaying individuality, picked up quickly on campus. We had nearly 1,000 students in the community then."" Over the past decade, hip-hop dance, which originated in the United States in the 1970s and includes a variety of styles, such as breaking, locking and popping, has taken root in China.,  The first national touring competition of hip-hop dance kicked off on June 3 and will run through December, Xia has announced in his role as deputy-director of the China Hip-Hop Union Committee. That was founded by the Chinese Dancers Association in 2013. The competition will see group and singles sections of each style under hip-hop dance. ""In the following six months, more than 300,000 competitors from 300 cities across the country will participate in the event,"" says Xia. He also notes that teaching materials about hip-hop dance have been published by China Federation of Literary and Art Circles Publishing House in 2015, which enables the dance style to be formal and systemic. ""There's now a vibrant and fast-developing street dancing scene in China,"" Xia adds. ""Like any contemporary art form, street dancing is about using art as a platform to have our voices heard."" As the dance form is becoming more popular, Xia says he hopes awareness grows.,  ""During the past 10 years, street dance is not a minority taste anymore. It's a culture embraced by young people. The performances of street dances on television shows and in movies helped the dance form quickly spread in China,"" says Feng Shuangbai, president of the China Dancers Association. He says he hopes that ""more highly skilled dancers and choreographers will be discovered via this competition"". Xia, who was born in Xi'an, Shaanxi province and graduated from the CUC with a major of TV and movie directing in 2006, studied further for his master's degree at the same university in 2011 and worked at China Central Television before devoting himself to promoting hip-hop dance in 2013. Since the China Hip-Hop Union Committee was founded, he says, over 30 subcommittees have been launched across China during the past four years. He has just concluded the recording of a variety show, called Dance World, which will be aired by CCTV during the summer vacation and features 80 young Chinese hip-hop dancers. Xia also notes that though hip-hop dance is an imported culture, Chinese dancers have combined it with Chinese culture, including tai chi, martial arts and local operas. Xiao Jie, a hip-hop dancer-choreographer and a native of Chengdu, Sichuan province, is one of the pioneers.,  He collaborated with Peking Opera performer Qiu Jirong on a show, which combined the iconic Peking Opera character Monkey King with street dancing in the Spring Festival gala aired by Beijing Television early this year. ""It was a really fascinating time when I started dancing. I just imitated the dancing steps from music videos. When the music is playing it's automatic for me to move to it,"" Xiao says. With friends who shared the same passion for street dancing, Xiao danced for hours every day. ""Street dancing is a great platform for young people to mingle and communicate. They love street dancing for its own sake,"" he says. Xiao's mother didn't approve of him becoming a hip-hop dancer－a culture often considered unhealthy and seen as linked to drugs and crime－until she realized that he was serious. In 2003, Xiao came to Beijing to study dancing at Capital Normal University for two years. In 2007, when an annual hip-hop dance competition held in the United Kingdom came to China to recruit Chinese candidates, Xiao applied and won first prize, which enabled him to compete in the UK. Now, Xiao has his own studio, teaching and choreographing. He says that only when Chinese dancers present their original street dancing choreography works could they be recognized worldwide."

The event will feature a series of classic works from countries related to the Belt and Road Initiative, including ballet   performed by a Belarus dance company.  Princess Sissi, or Elisabeth Amalia Eugenia von Wittelsbach, became well-known due to the 1955 film  . Her life and experience as Empress of Austria and Queen of Hungary in the 19th century have inspired many dramas, animations and musicals.

0,"Xiongan New Area in North China's Hebei province can establish one or more high-level universities on its own, a university expert said.  ""During its construction and development, Xiongan also should improve its own innovative system, rather than only receive innovative resources from Beijing,"" Li Guoping, head of the Beijing Development Institute at Peking University, was quoted as saying by China Newsweek. Xiongan New Area is about 100 kilometers southwest of Beijing. Officials announced on April 1 that it would be set up. The area's priority is to receive Beijing's ""non-capital"" functions, including large enterprises, financial institutions, colleges and research institutions. Since April, many colleges and schools from Beijing have started cooperation or have showed willingness to cooperate with Xiongan. Peking University, one of the most prestigious educational institutions in China, has visited the area and is planning to establish a first-class health center here to do related research, talent training and provide medical services. The university's famed Guanghua School of Management will set up a training center to bolster management studies and techniques. Renmin University of China in Beijing also has started to set up a medical college focusing on traditional Chinese medicine, while Beijing Sport University has proposed establishing a college for sports medicine and recovery in Xiongan. Li said Xiongan can launch its own universities and bring in advanced educational resources from home and abroad. ""Based on advantages, universities in Bejing can help Xiongan's own colleges by just supporting one of its schools,"" Li said. He added the level of higher education and scientific research in Hebei can thus be improved."

The Fate of the Furious opens with a scene showing unattended cars getting hacked by anarchist Cipher and then rolling off New York high-rises, creating chaos. Reality could well mimic fiction, experts said.  The Beijing Municipal Commission of Transport predicted that the market size of China's smart internet-connected vehicle industry will exceed 100 billion yuan ($15 billion) by 2020.  ""We're entering a Big Security Era. Cybersecurity is no longer only about the internet. It's about almost every aspect of the offline world, and is thus an important part of national security,"" said Zhou Hongyi, chairman and CEO of Qihoo 360 Technology Co, China's biggest internet security company.  Agreed Zhang Zhiyong, founder and CEO of Wenfeng Automobile Consultancy. He said just like smartphones and personal computers, it is possible for a fleet of vehicles to get hacked at the same time.  ""A number of autonomous vehicles used in a ride-sharing service would all run on the same system, receiving regular software updates. Through a process known as ""subversion"", a hacker or another organization could interfere with the update process and add in code that allows for remote access,"" Zhang said.  According to Zhou, automobiles could well be one of the next major targets of cyberattacks. To prepare for any such eventuality, Qihoo 360 unveiled a ""security car"" by partnering with WM Motor, an emerging e-carmarker, last month at the annual Cybersecurity Week, an event aimed at raising awareness of knowledge and policies related to cybersecurity.  The car is equipped with a whole set of security solutions that cover components, systems and chips.  The system can detect cyberattacks almost in real time, predict risks of being hacked by calculating existing data, and deliver repair codes to cars.  ""In future, people can manage their vehicles in the same way they deal with computers,"" said Liu Jianhao, who is in charge of the internet-connected automobile security lab at Qihoo 360.  According to him, the Beijing-based company is offering both in-car and cloud-based solutions to better deal with cybersecurity issues.  At the cybersecurity event, Qihoo 360 also unveiled a slate of smart transportation solutions by ensuring safety among vehicle-to-human communication and interaction.  According to Zhang, a cyberattacker may slowly creep into software systems until the point of attack and taking control.  Qihoo predicts that by 2020, about 60 percent of automobiles will be connected to the internet, with vehicles becoming the third-largest segment connecting consumers with online services."

0,"Guided by volunteers, visually impaired athletes tackle marathon tasks to prove that it is not the winning but the taking part that counts both in a race and in life as they inspire with a determination to overcome the odds. Running a marathon takes determination, courage, perseverance. It is an arduous undertaking that requires months of dedicated training. But for some of the runners on the Beijing marathon on Sept 16, they had to overcome challenges far greater than the majority of those they competed against. For 21 of the runners pounding the capital's roads were visually impaired and had to compete ""tied"" to another runner for guidance. ""I feel relieved after all of them completed the race safely, and the 87 volunteer guides who gave up their own participation to help our visually impaired runners did an incredible job,"" a volunteer guide and trainer Li Yubao said. Li is a volunteer who has been guiding those runners for more than two years. Now he is the leader of a group of volunteers in a running group providing professional training for the visually impaired. To prepare for the Beijing marathon, he arranged regular training for volunteers and participant runners for two months. It is a great honor to run the Beijing marathon for normal runners, not to say those with visual impairment, Li said, adding that their competition results are better than predicted and two runners even finished the race within four hours. Li, 39, is a system engineer who works in Intel in Beijing. When it comes to the weekend, he becomes the eyes and navigator for the visually impaired and runs with them in the Olympic Green every Saturday morning. The He Yajun Running Group, named after the runner who initially set it up in 2015, now has more than 1,000 visually impaired runners and has over 600 people willing to help. When jogging in the park one day in 2016, Li's attention was caught by a special group of runners who were tied to each other in pairs with a rope, with ""visually impaired"" and ""guide"" marked in the back of their running gear. ""I was curious and asked around about them"", he said. Li finally joined the group and became a volunteer guide in August 2016. Li has already guided all of the members in the group. The group has participated in more than 20 marathons, and some of the runners have even run in foreign events in Europe. Visually impaired runners can be divided into partially or totally without sight. According to Li, volunteer guides typically need to be in better physical condition than the disabled runners. ""Guides must have the energy to take care of the runners"", Li said. ""A guide is expected to keep visually impaired runners safe and informed at all times, help them with pacing and warn them about obstacles"", Li said. ""A caring and responsible heart is what is needed to be a capable and reliable guide runner"", he said. Volunteers in their group are required to cover their eyes in training to experience sightless running. ""Running blindfolded and allowing others to guide you will enable you to feel what it's like running with little or no vision, and you will realize how much the runners trust you and you will be aware of your responsibilities"", Li said. ""It is difficult for those with visual impairment to get here in the morning, they have to catch the first train or bus"", he said, adding that it takes a lot of courage just to train. Li noted that runners in their group are disciplined and organized. ""They are never late for training"", he said. After Li joined the group, he required the runners and volunteers to train scientifically and healthily. ""We are a running group, we have to stimulate our talent and challenge our limits"", Li said. ""What impressed me most is that although they are physically vulnerable, they are mentally strong"", he said. ""The first visually impaired runner I guided impressed me a lot with his perseverance"", Li said, adding that they ran together in heavy rain, and with his professional guidance and encouragement the runner completed his first 10-km event. Volunteers and runners get along well in their group. They are not just running partners, they are also friends.,Li said that the runners are kind and are always grateful for volunteers' help. ""They are considerate and often worried about if the volunteers would be too exhausted, sometimes they even crack jokes to make volunteers laugh"", he said. ""They bring positive energy to our lives and their optimistic attitude toward life is inspirational"", he added. The spirit of partnership does not end when they cross the finish line. Li and other volunteers also take runners for medical checkups and buy them new gear. ""I am proud of what I've done for them."" Li said. In order to better align work with his volunteering activity, he persuaded his company to organize a marathon race on Sept 22 in the Olympic Green. When talking about his public service work, he said volunteers serve as a bridge between the general society and vulnerable groups. He Yajun, founder of the running group, said that without volunteer guides, the runners cannot even take the first step. He lost his eyesight when he was 10 years old after a fever. He was depressed for several years and attempted a suicide. But he finally got through the dark times and started a business in Beijing as a blind masseur. He started running in 2014 and completed his first overseas marathon in Barcelona in March 2016. He said that running helped improve his physical condition and he became more optimistic. ""We are counting on the volunteers to guide us, they are our eyes and we rely on them"", He said. He noted that having a partner to exercise with pushed him to improve his fitness and also made him more aware of the surroundings. He has been guided by Li many times. ""Li is very professional and he runs fast"", he said, adding that he feels happy to run with him. When they run together, Li gives him professional insight like a coach, and in daily life Li is a caring friend, He said. ""He is serious during training"", He said, adding that sometimes he can push the runners if he thinks they are slacking off. ""I hope more runners as well as volunteers join us,"" he said."

1,"As the water diversion project is in full swing in Xiongan, North China's Hebei province, Li Qingshan, who is responsible for the project, makes no secret of his pride. The project, taking water from China's Yellow River to Baiyangdian Lake, the largest in the province, is one of the first to be carried out since the central authorities announced the establishment of Xiongan New Area in April 2017. ""By the end of February, the lake will receive 35 million cubic meters of water,"" Li, a senior manager at China Xiongan Group Ecological Construction Co, said, adding that the work was kicked off on Feb 1 after seven pump systems had been installed. Li and his team will start in March to complete the construction of a whole station, including a pump house. The project is one of the measures for the ecological restoration of Baiyangdian Lake in Xiongan, the largest wetland ecosystem in northern China. The water level of the lake will stand at 6.5 to 7 meters deep and its coverage will be restored to 360 square kilometers by 2035, according to a plan for Baiyangdian's ecological environment treatment and protection (2018-35), quoted by China National Radio. The plan is in line with the speech made by President Xi Jinping, during his first visit to Xiongan on Feb 23, 2017. He stressed that the lake should be well restored and protected as the development proceeds. Now, two years later, the new area has shifted its focus from preliminary plan to construction. About 100 kilometers southwest of Beijing, Xiongan New Area is scheduled to expand to 1,770 square kilometers by 2035, according to People's Daily. As an integral part of the integrated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, Beijing's noncapital functions will be transferred to Xiongan. Since its establishment, the authorities have taken the time to make a series of plans for the development of Xiongan, which is designated to have a lasting significance for many years to come. According to Lin Nianxiu, vice-minister of the National Development and Reform Commission, the blueprint for Xiongan, including development plans and supporting policies, has been completed over the past two years. In December, the central authorities approved an overall plan for Xiongan New Area (2018-35). ""This is the first year that plans for Xiongan will be implemented and the construction of key projects will be pushed ahead,"" said Wang Dongfeng, Hebei's Party secretary. China Xiongan Group, a State-owned company established in 2017 for Xiongan's development, has made about 30 bidding announcements on its website for carrying out projects since September. The projects include the construction of greenbelts, waste treatment facilities, rail transit stations, urban roads, pipe network systems, and a complex of offices and hotels. By 2022, the construction of infrastructure will be basically completed and the appearance of an urban area will be initially formed, Xinhua News Agency quoted the overall plan for Xiongan as saying. Preliminary results will also be achieved by then to transfer Beijing's noncapital functions, including universities, research institutes, medical institutions, corporate headquarters, financial institutions, and public institutions. According to Chen Gang, Party secretary of Xiongan, the new area will control the use of land by developing up to 30 percent of its area in the long term, leaving the rest as green space and water areas. ""Xiongan will be a city with intermediate density where people can have good contact with nature,"" Yang Baojun, president of China Academy of Urban Planning and Design, was quoted as saying by China National Radio."
1,"China's top health authority is standing by its statement that more than 500 million people had been assigned family doctors as of the end of November, despite a barrage of questions raised by netizens. The National Health and Family Planning Commission said on Wednesday that the figure was based on data reported by local governments since May. It reiterated that the number of people who accessed family doctor services met the target for the year. According to a circular from the commission in May last year, more than 30 percent of China's population was supposed to be covered by family doctors by the end of this year. On Sunday, the commission said residents in more than 95 percent of China's cities can now access family doctors, with the total number exceeding 500 million people, more than 35 percent of the population. However, the announcement was met with disbelief by some netizens, who said the number was too high, Science and Technology Daily reported. While the commission said on Wednesday that the number of people covered by family doctors had met the target, it added that coverage varies by area, and quality of service in general needs improvement. A system of family doctors has been promoted nationwide since May and is in its infancy. Many difficulties exist, including a lack of general practitioners and customized grassroots services, the commission said. It said it will focus on improving family doctor services next year, so that residents are more satisfied with the services they receive. Measures include more intense training of healthcare workers at the grassroots. Currently, family doctors comprise physicians mainly working at grassroots medical institutions, such as community health centers and village health facilities. It is expected that family doctors who serve as health gatekeepers for residents will help solve health challenges such as the increasing number of patients with chronic diseases and soaring medical costs resulting from too many patients going to big hospitals while grassroots medical institutions are ignored, the commission said. Wang Xin, a family doctor at the Zhongliang Community Health Service Center in Beijing's Shunyi district, said that of all 1,200 residents in the community, about half have signed up with him, the sole family practitioner in the center. ""The biggest difficulty in promoting family doctors in Beijing is lack of enough qualified doctors,"" Wang said. ""In some areas a family doctor may not even have a bachelor's degree and cannot provide medical services; they can only provide public health services or prescribe drugs, so local residents lack trust and still prefer to go to big hospitals for treatment."" The number of people covered by family doctor services reached 7.6 million as of May, accounting for 35 percent of permanent residents in Beijing, according to the city's health commission. Beijing residents can sign up with family doctors in their communities for free because of subsidies from the city government."

With excitement rising over the city's hosting of the 2022 Winter Olympic Games, many used the three-day break to try out the ski slopes in the capital's outskirts. ""We love sports, and the upcoming Winter Olympics has really raised our interests in winter sports,"" said Li Lei, who spent the holiday with three friends at a ski resort in suburban Miyun county. He said the equipment and services at the resort were advanced, while the group stayed at a cozy hotel with good restaurants. To meet the growing demand for winter sports, the Beijing Skiing Association, resorts and sports goods companies organized ice and snow festivals to promote their services and products over the holidays. Established ski resorts in the capital's Huairou, Pinggu and Miyun counties were full of people day and night, while many parks, including around the Bird's Nest and Chaoyang Park, held skating or skiing activities to entertain the public. The combined revenue of 60 key commercial services companies reached 2.67 billion yuan between Saturday and Monday, representing growth of 10.5 percent compared with the same period last year, according to the Beijing Commerce Commission. The commission did not provide a detailed breakdown of the revenue from winter sports－the so-called white economy－but said it had become a new consumption hot spot. According to a report from the China Tourism Academy, the domestic winter travel market over 2016 and 2017 was worth 270 billion yuan. This is forecast to expand to 670 billion yuan in 2021 and 2022. ""The output value of the winter travel and related industries will reach 2.88 trillion yuan"" by the time Beijing and co-host Zhangjiakou in Hebei province welcome the Winter Olympics, the report added. Li Xiaoge, chairman of the Beijing Skiing Association, said the existing ski resorts and winter travel destinations across China cannot meet the booming demand, which means more will likely be built in the coming years. Beijing has 22 indoor and outdoor ski slopes, according to the association. Traditional retail companies in the capital saw their New Year's sales grow more than 20 percent compared with last year, according to data from the commerce commission."

Besides large-scale activities such as the opening ceremony and the China Pavilion Day, visitors can also enjoy special activities like float parades and performances of world ethnic cultures, according to the organizer. ""These cultural activities are organized by more than 60 countries and international organizations, making the expo a great platform for diverse cultures across the globe and showing the harmony between humans and nature,"" said Wang Hong, deputy mayor of Beijing. Open from April 29 to Oct 7, the expo will exhibit flower, fruit and vegetable farming at the foot of the Great Wall in the capital's Yanqing district. All the preparation work including construction of the site as well as interior decoration for 110 official and 120 non-official exhibitors have been completed. This is the second time for China to hold such a high-level horticulture expo. The southwestern Chinese city of Kunming held the expo in 1999."
0,"Film director Wuershan is spending a decade adapting a classic novel into a film trilogy, Xu Fan reports. With a big budget and a crew of more than 2,000 members, Chinese film director Wuershan says he is spending a decade adapting a mythological epic into cinema. ""The Chinese film market has reached a phase and scale with which we can produce grand works that showcase the country's rich legacies in history and culture,"" Wuershan, who turned 47 in early June, says during an interview with China Daily. ""I have selected the most important work from my perspective and I expect to spend 10 years on the film project."" His Fengshen Trilogy films is adapted from the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) novel Fengshen Yanyi (Creation of the Gods), a mythical retelling of a war from more than 3,000 years ago. Its major storyline unfolds through a subsidiary state's ruler who leads an army to defeat a tyrant. The novel fictionalizes a turbulent era when two conflicting human forces get help from supernatural beings such as deities and spirits. A lot of money and time will be needed to bring the story onto the big screen, with special effects playing a major role. Fascinated by the novel since childhood, the filmmaker who was born in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region, announced the project's launch in 2012. Wuershan is one of China's best fantasy film directors, exemplified by the blockbusters Painted Skin: The Resurrection and Mojin: The Lost Legend. He chose Beijing Culture as a partner for the film project.,One of the fastest-growing entertainment media companies in China, Beijing Culture is credited with several hits, including the country's all-time top and second-highest grossing films, Wolf Warrior 2 and The Wandering Earth, respectively. From 2016 to 2017, the trilogy project launched a campaign to short list 30 young people from more than 15,000 aspirants. Of the winners, 16 were selected to join the cast, with six playing major characters. Du Yang, vice-president of Beijing Culture, says the cast consists of A-list stars, veteran actors and young people, but doesn't reveal the names. The trilogy, which is now being shot in the coastal city of Qingdao, Shandong province, is scheduled to release its three feature-length films consecutively every year from 2020 to 2022. Last year, all the youngsters on the project had a six-month training in Chinese history, culture, ancient etiquette, horse riding and so on. And some who play spirits in avatars of animals were given extra study material on the habits of wild creatures. The trilogy marks the acting debut of a woman who plays Su Daji, a vixen spirit embodying a beautiful woman who bewitches King Zhou, hastening the fall of the dictator, in the novel. Wuershan says he has asked her to research on foxes to prepare for her role. Barrie M. Osborne, the trilogy's production consultant says as a result the woman is now good at simulating fox emotions and moves. Best known as a producer of The Lord of the Rings franchise, Osborne's experience during the shooting of the Peter Jackson epic trilogy will help Fengshen's production process, during which the three films are being shot simultaneously. Movie sequels in China are usually shot after watching how the first installments do at the box office.,The producers of the Fengshen trilogy have acquired more than 30 horses from abroad including Germany, the Netherlands and Hungary, and have kept them in a ranch of 1,800 square meters in Qingdao. Bill Lawrence, a US horse trainer who worked on Steven Spielberg's 2011 film War Horse, is now training the horses for the Chinese films. The young people who will play warriors or princes are being trained to shoot arrows from horsebacks. No stand-ins are being used for such roles, says the director. ""Previously, most of the cast members that I worked with were big stars. This project also marks my first time working with newcomers on a large scale,"" Wuershan says. This might have been the only way to realize his dream project, as celebrities charge more in film fees and their schedules are busy, with less time for preparation. ""I am too stressed to fall asleep each night before the day when a youngster begins to shoot for his or her first sequence. Fortunately, they are all living up to my expectations, ""he says. As the story takes place around more than 3,000 years ago but the novel was shaped in recent centuries, the films' sets and costumes are a mix of different dynastic styles. The director draws inspiration from bronze artifacts of the Shang (c. 16th century-11th century BC) and Zhou (c. 11th century-256 BC) dynasties at museums, the shuilu (water and land) paintings between the 13th century and 15th century, and landscape paintings of the Song Dynasty (960-1279). ""Chinese culture features an enduring history. I wish that such legacies are not only displayed in museums or seen in some foreign films featuring a few Chinatown-set scenes but showcased in an epic which can go abroad,"" he says. Around 800 carpenters from Shexian county in Anhui province and Dongyang city in Zhejiang province were recruited to make wooden sculptures for King Zhou's lavish palaces. The main royal palace, which totally took 35,000 hours to design and build, has installed more than 3,000 oil lamps. At least 40,000 pieces of props, including weapons, costumes, carriages and vessels are being made. ""The novel has values that could be passed down generations,"" says Wuershan, adding that he wants to connect audiences of different ages through the films."
0,"The percentage of children of young migrant parents in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou who do not attend school is higher than the national average, according to a report on migrants under age 35 released by the National Population and Family Planning Commission. The commission looked at the lives of the ""floating population"" - migrants who do not acquire permanent resident permits, or hukou, in their new cities - of people younger than 35. It found that more than 60 percent of these migrants in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou brought their children with them. In Beijing, 82 percent of those children ages 7 to 13 go to public schools, and in Guangzhou, 56 percent, according to the report. However, 3.5 percent of those children in Beijing do not attend school; in Shanghai, 5.1 percent and in Guangzhou, 5.3 percent. Nationwide, only 2 percent of the school-age children of the young floating population do not go to school, the report said. Zhang Yi, a demographics expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said around 75 percent of the floating population in big cities are migrants who leave rural areas to find manual jobs in cities. Zhang said most floating population children who do not go to school are from migrant laborer families, who usually live on the outskirts of big cities, where education resources are limited. ""Migrant workers often change jobs and place of residence, and this would easily cause delays in their children's schooling,"" he said. ""Some schools charge additional fees for the children of migrant families, which are beyond the families' means. This contributes to these children's comparatively high rate of non-enrollment in schools in big cities."" Although some private schools are established in city outskirts for migrant children, Zhang said, some of these have been demolished to make way for urban renewal projects, because most of these schools are set up in deserted factories. Zhang suggested the government think twice before demolishing such schools because this is likely to increase the number of children dropping out of school. Feng Xiliang, a labor expert at the Capital University of Economics and Business in Beijing, suggested allocating more education resources to city outskirts to close the gap between those and downtown areas. ""The government should consider basing the allocation of public resources on each region's population instead of the number of hukou-holders,"" Zhang suggested. The report also said that in Beijing, the average per capita income of the young floating population is 3,280 yuan ($515) a month; in Shanghai, it's 3,000 yuan and in Guangzhou, 2,470 yuan. The national average is about 2,500 yuan. Those who hold a bachelor's or higher academic degree earn 5,650 yuan a month in Beijing; 5,760 yuan in Shanghai and 6,570 yuan in Guangzhou. The national average is 4,600 yuan. In those three cities, the proportion of the young floating population working in high-income and knowledge- or technology-intensive sectors such as finance, real estate, scientific research, education and health are much higher than the national level, said the report. In those cities, they are more likely to find jobs via the Internet, it said, while elsewhere, they generally seek help from their families, relatives and friends, it said. chenxin1@chinadaily.com.cn"
1,"Han Lu, 45, a businessman in the auto industry who travels frequently, is looking forward to Beijing Daxing International Airport opening－which is scheduled for Sept 30－because he lives in the south of the city. ""I usually spend more than one and a half hours getting to Beijing Capital International Airport from home. Hopefully, the new airport will save me an hour on the road,"" he said. On the other hand, Wang Liu, 36, a marketing director whose company has headquarters in Shanghai, is worried that it may take her much longer to get to the new airport from her home in the northwest of Beijing. ""I fly to Shanghai four times a month on average, sometimes even more. China Eastern Airlines, whose flights I take most of the time, will move to the new airport, which probably means I will have to spend much more time getting there,"" she said. ""It will be a problem for me."" Beijing Daxing International Airport, an 80 billion yuan ($11.6 billion) project, will affect or even change people's lives, including those of travelers from all over the world, Beijing residents, airline employees and people living in nearby areas such as Tianjin and Hebei province. The airport, which will be the largest in the world when completed, will contribute to the global air transportation network and economic growth in Beijing's southern districts as well as nearby regions. It will also produce business opportunities for both domestic and foreign airlines, according to a government official and industry experts. Cui Xiaohao, deputy head of the Beijing Commission of Development and Reform and deputy director of the new airport's office, said the facility is the key project for Beijing this year and will enable the capital to serve as the country's international communications, cultural, political and scientific innovation center. ""More than 100 million passengers used Beijing Capital International Airport last year, which is close to its capacity,"" Cui said. ""The new airport will ease pressure on the existing one, giving it a chance to improve its facilities and service."" The Civil Aviation Administration of China predicts that the number of passengers using Beijing's airports annually will reach 150 million by 2025. The new airport is designed to handle 45 million passengers annually by 2021 and 72 million by 2025. There are long-term plans to expand the number to 100 million, according to CAAC. Cui said: ""That will further improve Beijing's role as the international communications center of China by creating better airport conditions and airline services. The new airport will help balance Beijing's economic growth between the northern and southern areas of the city."" The northern areas have long been considered to be more developed than those in the south. There are more universities, high-tech companies and research institutions in northern Beijing, while southern districts are home to clothing wholesale outlets, buildings material markets, factories and farmland. Daxing district was selected as the site for the new airport to help accelerate the industrial transformation of the area, Cui said. ""The new airport will bring talent, related businesses and services to southern areas, which will boost the local economy,"" he added. Li Lei, a principal with the Roland Berger consultancy in Shanghai, said the new airport will help drive the coordinated development of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei. It also has advantages in meeting the demands of the Xiongan New Area, whose main function is to serve as a development hub for these three regions. The new airport, which is expected to become North China's air travel hub, is situated on the border of Beijing and Langfang, Hebei. It is 46 kilometers from Tian'anmen Square, 26 km from downtown Langfang, 55 km from the Xiongan New Area and 67 km from Beijing Capital International Airport. Given the strong regional transportation network between Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei, travelers landing at the new airport will be able to reach downtown Beijing, the city's government sub-center in Tongzhou district and the Xiongan New Area within half an hour. They can also reach nearby cities including Shijiazhuang, Tangshan and Baoding in Hebei, along with Tianjin, within an hour of landing, according to the new airport's office. Li said, ""The new airport is farther from the downtown area than Beijing Capital International Airport, and there will be some disadvantages for it to attract business travelers in the initial stages of operations. ""However, a number of State-owned enterprises in Beijing plan to move to the Xiongan New Area, and the new airport is predicted to attract more travelers who take business trips from this area to other regions."" Completion of the new project will bring business opportunities to the two major Beijing airports and airlines－including those staying at the existing airport and those moving to the new one. ""Cooperation between the two airports is greater than their competition, and they will complement each other,"" Li said. On Jan 3, CAAC said the new airport is designed as a large international aviation hub, the new growth driver for the nation's development and a comprehensive transportation hub for the integrated development of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei. Meanwhile, Beijing Capital International Airport will take on the role of an international aviation hub for the Asia-Pacific region. Cui, the deputy director, said, ""Different from the two airports in Shanghai, where one is mainly for domestic airlines and the other mostly for international carriers, the two in Beijing will both be international."" He said this arrangement, added with the airports in Tianjin and Shijiazhuang, capital of Hebei, will form a world-class airport complex in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei cluster. Tianjin airport will become the international airfreight center for North China and a regional hub, while the one in Shijiazhuang will be developed into a hub for budget airlines and an air courier center. CAAC also announced plans for the relocation of airlines. Carriers including China Southern, China Eastern, Beijing Capital Airlines and China United Airlines will move to the new facility, while others such as Air China, Hainan Airlines and Grand China Air will remain at Beijing Capital International Airport. Foreign airlines, along with those from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, can choose which airport they operate from, with the option of having a presence at both. Chinese carriers, except China Postal Airlines, will have to use just one airport. The phased transition will start from next winter and be completed over 12 months, CAAC said. Li, at Roland Berger, said, ""In the initial period of operation, the revenue of airlines that move to the new airport may be affected. Take China Eastern, for example－its most profitable flights are those operating between Beijing and Shanghai, and the carrier may lose some business travelers after the move. ""However, with the improvement in services and better infrastructure at the new airport, such losses will gradually be recovered. The new airport can also attract more passengers by introducing better shopping experiences and smart devices."" Huang Pu, general manager of China Eastern's planning and coordination division in Beijing, sees the move to the new airport as a great opportunity for the company to make the capital its most important market outside of its Shanghai headquarters. ""We have detailed plans to expand our network and invest in the support project at the new airport,"" he said. As a foreign airline with the right to choose its operating location in Beijing, Air France KLM plans to move to the new airport. Toon Balm, general manager of Air France KLM China, said many people fly from Europe to Beijing, but they do not stop in the city, and continue their journeys on flights operated by the carrier's Chinese partners. ""China Eastern, China Southern and many other airlines in the Sky-Team Airline Alliance will move to the new airport, so we will follow,"" he said. Balm said Air France KLM hopes the new airport will bring additional traffic, and from a commercial perspective that business can grow. He added that the carrier needs to be very flexible with its aircraft, network, slots and customers. He said moving to the new airport is a challenge, but from a business perspective it is very interesting. American Airlines, the largest carrier by fleet size, said it is considering opportunities for increased connectivity with China Southern, including moving with the carrier to the new airport. However, a final decision has not been made. In 2017, American Airlines made a $200 million equity investment in China Southern, creating a foundation for their long-term partnership. Code sharing and interline agreements between the two carriers give customers of both access to many more destinations in China, as well as North and South America, the US airline said. Anthony Flynn, communications manager for Asia-Pacific at American Airlines, said: ""In November, American Airlines and China Southern took steps to further strengthen our partnership with a significant expansion of code-sharing cooperation and the launch of reciprocal frequent flyer benefits and lounge access. These benefits are due to come online this year. ""China and the United States are the two biggest air travel markets in the world, with growth forecast in the business and leisure sectors. With the opening of Beijing Daxing International Airport in 2019 and the ability to cooperate fully with China Southern, American Airlines is excited about its future in the Chinese market."" According to the office at the new airport, 80 percent of the interior construction has been completed and all the external work is finished. The water supply pipeline network and electricity transformer substations are ready, while a natural gas pipeline will soon be in use. Green and energy-saving concepts were adopted for the airport's design and construction. Passengers will spend a maximum of eight minutes getting from the center of the terminal to the farthest boarding gate, about one-third the time spent at Beijing Capital International Airport, according to the office. Renewable energy will comprise more than 10 percent of the new airport's energy consumption mix when construction is completed. This will rank it No 1 in terms of the renewable energy adoption level at airports nationwide, according to the Beijing Municipal Commission of Development and Reform. Photovoltaic solar energy panels have been fitted on roofs of the parking lots and business jets hangar, while geothermal energy will be used in the airport's service facilities. The solar energy generation system will provide 6.1 million kilowatt-hours annually for the new facility, accounting for 1 percent of total energy consumption. Traditional power plants and natural gas will also supply energy to the site. A comprehensive network will help travelers reach Beijing districts or nearby cities, and it is forecast that more than 50 percent of them will use public transportation at the new airport."
1,"China's plan to develop a special economic zone－the Xiongan New Area－near Beijing has fueled a stock market frenzy all right, but analysts remain skeptical such optimism would create a sustainable bull market. The plan has injected an unexpected element of excitement into the A-share market, lifting investors' risk preference and boosting expectation for improved corporate earnings, especially the profitability of companies in sectors such as infrastructure, construction materials, transportation and environmental protection. But analysts warned short-term market optimism is unlikely to lead to a sustainable rise in share prices as overall economic prospects could still face downward pressure. Chen Letian, an analyst at BOC International, said the mid- to long-term market trend will be determined by key factors such as stock valuations, corporate profitability and the interest rate environment, noting that the plan to set up a new economic zone is unlikely to change the overall economic cycle direction in China. ""While it is a 'historic' decision, we don't think it will change the underlying trend of the economy and we suggest investors should remain cautious on any potential market corrections,"" Chen said. The central authorities announced on April 1 the plan to set up the Xiongan New Area in Hebei province to relocate some low-priority functions from Beijing, in order to ease the pressure of being a metropolitan city on the national capital. While economists agree that the ambitious project could spur greater infrastructure and property investment, they said uncertainty shrouds the sustainability of an infrastructure investment-led growth. And given the potential for a tighter market liquidity, the authorities will likely continue to push financial deleveraging to contain asset bubbles. Gao Ting, head of China strategy at UBS Securities, said investors have shifted focus from the recent upturn in China's economic data to whether robust property and infrastructure investment will be sustained in the second half of this year. Nonetheless, Gao said that the expectation of building the Xiongan New Area into an innovative, market-driven green city will mean that the environmental protection sector can be a major beneficiary of the plan. ""China has made green development a key priority for the Xiongan New Area, and is phasing out low-end manufacturing throughout Hebei province. The region urgently needs to address its environmental issues and may start doing so before urban construction begins,"" he said in a research note. Zhao Yang, chief China economist at Nomura Securities, said the Xiongan New Area could spur slightly stronger fixed asset investment growth, particularly in infrastructure and property investment, in coming years. But Zhao said that extent of the project's positive impact on economic growth could be limited because it depends on the course of monetary policy. ""If the monetary policy remains prudent and neutral, then financing of the project may crowd out other public or private investment expenditure. However, if the project's importance is enough to tempt the central bank to ease its policy stance, the risk is that this could trigger a surge in inflation,"" Zhao said.

1,"More than 130,000 polluting companies in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region have suspended production or shut down amid comprehensive controls to curb air pollution in the autumn and winter, environmental authorities said on Tuesday.  After blue skies over the weekend, the air quality in many cities of the region including Beijing, Tianjin, and Shijiazhuang, Tangshan and Baoding in Hebei province is forecast to decline to the moderate or even severe level on Wednesday and Thursday, according to the China National Environmental Monitoring Center.  It will once again improve, reaching the good level on Friday, it added.  In response to coping with frequent air pollution in the autumn and winter, environment authorities in Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei province, have pledged to continue strict controls and carry out extra measures to curb pollution.  ""Hebei province has dealt with around 108,500 polluting companies, including closing them down or suspending their production in 2017,"" Gao Jianmin, head of the Hebei Provincial Environment Bureau, said on Tuesday.  Besides, 19,000 polluting companies were found in Tianjin, of which half were shut down completely, said Wen Wurui, Gao's counterpart in Tianjin.  Around 6,000 polluting companies were shut down in Beijing.  The three heads of the environment bureaus introduced their measures to tackle with winter smog, showing that coal consumption for heating services is another major target along with restrictions on industrial production.  In the downtown districts of Beijing and Tianjin, gas or electricity has replaced coal as the source of winter heating, and in Hebei more than 2 million households in urban and rural areas have switched their fuel as well, according to the three officials.  In Beijing, total coal consumption was reduced to 7 million metric tons in 2017, compared with 23 million tons in 2013, ""and 90 percent of the current energy mix was high-quality energy including gas, greatly helping to reduce emissions,"" said Fang Li, head of Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau.  More companies in heavy industry will reduce their production to lower emissions in the region - for example, 396 major companies from the casting, iron and steel and construction sectors in Tianjin will do so from Wednesday, Wen said.  The comprehensive measures in the three areas resulted in an improvement in air quality, such as the average concentration of PM2.5, hazardous fine particulate matter, which declined in Tianjin from Oct 1 to 25 by 24 percent year-on-year, said Wen from Tianjin.  ""But the severe air pollution for days in a row hampered the improvements,"" Wen added. ""Therefore it's a priority to take extra measures when there is severe air pollution.""  The Ministry of Environmental Protection has sent inspection teams to monitor the three governments to deal with pollution problems to improve regional air quality."
1,"LONDON - Over the week, international businesses, including British companies, have flocked to Shanghai for China International Import Expo (CIIE) to tap the huge market of the world's second-largest economy and seize possibly unmissable business opportunities. Drawn by the potential of the Chinese market, British International Trade Secretary Liam Fox led a delegation of 50 firms displaying British innovation to the first-ever event, which showcased opportunities for businesses to sell goods into China. Some British companies have secured lucrative deals with Chinese peers, including Rolls-Royce which signed an engine and maintenance agreement worth 10.13 billion yuan ($1.45 billion) with China's Eastern Airlines, one of the largest deals at the CIIE. ""Coming at this time, the CIIE has highlighted that China's economy will become more open, which is a positive message for businesses everywhere,"" said Stuart Tait, regional head of Commercial Banking at HSBC Asia-Pacific. HSBC released a special report at the CIIE to inspire international businesses to shift their strategies to do business in China, underlining the importance of understanding the Chinese consumers. ""To succeed in the future, international businesses must be 'Made for China.' China is no longer just the world's factory; its fast-growing consumer market is prompting international businesses to re-evaluate how and what they sell to China,"" Tait said. The report, entitled ""HSBC Navigator: Made for China"", surveyed 1,205 small and large companies across 11 key global economies that already export to China or are considering doing so. It found that businesses truly 'Made for China' are targeting those Chinese consumers born after 1980 to drive sales growth, and that technology services, consumer electronics and high-end intelligent equipment will be the fastest-growing sectors in the next three to five years. It also said the quality of their products will have to appeal to Chinese consumers, and distribution partners and e-commerce platforms are key to success in this market. David Roth, a senior executive of WPP, a world leader in communications services, said it's important for companies to understand Chinese consumers and to create products and innovation that are absolutely relevant to Chinese consumers. ""They shouldn't assume that products they currently make will necessarily be accepted by Chinese consumers,"" said Roth, CEO of The Store WPP in EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) and Asia. ""And that to create unique, different products or slightly change products to best meet the large Chinese market is going to be one of the reasons why some companies will succeed in China and some companies will fail,"" said Roth. The marketing expert advised international businesses to keep an eye on the second-tier and third-tier cities outside Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, which are growing at a very fast rate with consumers to have a higher disposable income than in the past. ""Those cities probably will represent massive opportunities,"" he said. As there are more opportunities now for foreign companies to try selling in China through e-commerce platforms like Taobao or JD.com, they do not necessarily need to start businesses with brick-and-mortar shops in China. ""Once they test their products and know what sells and what doesn't sell through their experiment with e-commerce platforms, it gives them more understanding and knowledge and certainty for a bigger expansion strategy within China,"" Roth added."
0,"A Chinese tourist group began a visit to South Korea on Saturday, eight months after package tours were halted because of a diplomatic dispute sparked by the US military's deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system in the country. The tourist group of 32 people from Beijing will spend five days in Seoul, according to Sun Lichan, director of the marketing department of Haitao Travel, the tourism company that organized the trip. Any industry related to Lotte Group will be avoided in the company's new travel schedules, Sun said. The Lotte Duty Free Shop, a former popular shopping spot for Chinese tourists, will be replaced by the Shilla Duty Free Shop. Lotte Group, a retail giant in South Korea, accepted a plot of land in February in exchange for its Skyhill Golf Course in Seongju, where the US antimissile system will be deployed, a move that China strongly opposes. South Korea's trade and tourism industries saw downturns because of the THAAD issue. In March, Chinese travel agencies stopped selling package tours to South Korea after the THAAD deployment. ""As bilateral relations between the two sides have eased slowly recently, we began to reorganize group tours by contacting airline companies and travel agencies we can cooperate with in South Korea,"" Sun said. The company got a group visa to South Korea on Thursday - the first group visa to the country since March, Sun said. The group took an Asiana Airlines flight from Beijing Capital International Airport to South Korea's Incheon International Airport on Saturday, she said. ""Tourism to South Korea will recover gradually, but it's still a long way from the situation of a year ago,"" Sun said. Xu Xiaolei, chief brand officer for China Youth Travel Service, said: ""Customer consultations about group tours or travel visas to South Korea, either in person at our offices or by phone or online, have increased recently, but we have little data about traveling to South Korea."""
1,"Feng Chao has only been in the workforce for two years but is already on to her third job, something that would have been rare for earlier generations of workers. The 28-year-old from Beijing, who earned her bachelor's and master's degrees in the United States, spent just six months at her first job in a financial institution and then a year at a State-owned securities company. ""The first job was not challenging enough and the internal structure of the institution kept changing,"" she said. ""For the second job, I didn't think that I would have good career prospects there."" Feng's penchant for job-hopping is hardly novel among people of her generation. A report released this month by professional networking website LinkedIn－based on data gathered from 150,000 LinkedIn users on the Chinese mainland in July－revealed that those born since 1995 spend an average of just seven months in their first jobs. In contrast, those born in the 1980s spent about three and a half years in their first job. Those born in the 1970s were even more loyal, at four years and three months. A report published by MyCOS, an education consulting and research institute in Beijing, in July last year said one in three college graduates in the country quit their first jobs within six months in 2016. Social scientists and education experts attribute the phenomenon to the fact that younger people were born and raised in a more open environment, which has enabled them to be more independent and place more emphasis on their values and life goals. Some experts say today's job seekers also have greater access to opportunities in the employment market, which makes job-hopping easier. ""The moment they realize that the actual work is inconsistent with their expectations, many from the younger generation will not hesitate to look for other job options,"" said Zhou Haiwang, deputy director of the Institute of Population and Development at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences. ""To them, staying true to their feelings and attaining job satisfaction are of paramount importance."" Zhao Ming, 25, recently quit his first job, at a public relations agency in Beijing, after just nine months. He said he quit because he became frustrated with having to repeatedly redo plans to satisfy his boss and client. ""I only have two expectations for the initial years of my career path: finding a guide who can really help with my career development, and seeing my work results and gains,"" said Zhao, from Anshan, in northeastern China's Liaoning province. Zhang Jingyi, the human resources head at LinkedIn China, said young people who have grown up in the internet age－especially those who have studied abroad－are more open-minded and willing to try new things. This new mindset marks a shift from the previous one, where most people sought to begin their careers in well-known companies. This is the case for Feng, who is now working for a small investment agency with just 10 staff members. It is more important, she said, that the salary is competitive, her boss is competent, and there are sufficient opportunities for growth in the workplace. Another reason young people are job-hopping so frequently is the rapid development of the technology sector, which has created many new roles that those born since 1995 find interesting. The LinkedIn report said more than one-third of graduates born since 1995 had entered the internet and financial industries, while five years ago, a quarter of graduates born since 1990 joined such industries. ""During my four years in college, the internet changed our lives dramatically,"" Zhao said. ""New sectors such as the shared economy and blockchain have been emerging, and some of my peers have gone on to chase these new trends."" One person attracted by the vibrancy of such new tech industry segments is a graduate of Nanchang Aviation University in Jiangxi province, who declined to be named. She started her first job last summer at the Beijing company behind Douyin, a popular domestic short-video app. ""By being in this job, I can keep in touch with the latest ideas and developments in the internet industry,"" she said. ""I was very curious about the internet industry and had always wondered who the people working in it are. That's why I joined."" Feng said many of her former schoolmates are working in the internet and finance sectors because they tend to pay higher salaries. ""Compared with State-owned enterprises and banks, new or small firms have more active cultures and less administrative tasks, so this means we get to learn more and climb the ranks faster,"" she said. Experts say factors such as greater financial support and easier access to freelancing opportunities have also contributed to the job-hopping phenomenon. While changing jobs too frequently would affect company productivity and an employee's credibility, human resource managers say the onus is on employers to adapt to the current trends instead of expecting millennials to become more loyal. After all, according to estimates by Daxue Consulting, 75 percent of China's workforce will be made up of millennials by 2025. Chen Zhiyun, vice-president of human resources at Pier 88 Health, a foreign-funded enterprise in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, specializing in digital healthcare initiatives, said companies should ensure that the job information they provide during the hiring process is as accurate as possible to avoid miscommunication. ""The talent count in a company will only stay stable when employees' perception of the employer is aligned with what they were told, as well as their expectations,"" he said. Guo Shuang, senior vice-president of human resources at an online news provider based in Beijing, said employers need to adjust the way they manage and support young employees if they wish to retain talent. ""The post-95 people grew up with the internet, which allows them to take the initiative in searching for information, while many of their superiors in the workplace－those born a decade earlier－grew up in the age of TV, a one-way channel to obtain information,"" Guo said. ""So what enterprise managers did in the past－teaching employees what and how to do things and pointing out their faults－may not work for the youngsters today. The employer needs to support them with the right resources and environment so that they can grow and succeed. These two parties have to work together."""
0,"An ongoing exhibition at the China Agricultural Museum in Beijing showcases farming techniques used through the ages, Wang Kaihao reports. China has a long history of agriculture, but what is the legacy left by generations of Chinese farmers over the millennia? When traveling across the countryside by train or bus, you have probably seen much of that heritage, though this may have hardly registered with you. Now, an exhibition at the China Agricultural Museum in Beijing showcases these techniques and technologies, tangible or intangible, and explores their significance to modern society. The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs has so far chosen 91 agricultural practices from 28 provincial-level administrative regions for inclusion on the national heritage list, which was created in 2013. They are separated into nine categories, including ecosystem architecture, vegetable plantation, irrigation systems and animal feeding. All the entries are showcased at the Exhibition of China's Important Agricultural Heritage Systems through pictures, texts, traditional farming tools, and of course fresh produce. It is unprecedented to have such a comprehensive display covering the country's traditional agriculture, according to Liu Beihua, the director of the China Agricultural Museum. ""The exhibition shows our predecessors' understanding of natural rules, philosophies, and even sustainable development,"" says Liu. ""Today, people advocate an eco-friendly economy,"" she says, ""so, it becomes important to showcase the wisdom hidden in these techniques, and remind people to better protect our agrarian culture."",Many of the examples of China's agricultural heritage, which are showcased, are well-known. For instance, the Honghe Hani Rice Terraces, which have been a UNESCO World Heritage site since 2013. This agricultural system, which dates back 1,300 years in areas inhabited by the Hani ethnic group in Yunnan province, shows how local people overcame tough natural conditions to make full use of their scarce resources. People living by the West Lake in Hangzhou, the capital of Zhejiang province and also a UNESCO World Heritage site, have grown world famous Longjing Tea for 1,000 years, and have a system of planting that produces one of the best Chinese tea varieties. Speaking about the benefits of preserving the agricultural heritage, Liu says: ""As China makes efforts to revitalize its rural areas, the old traditions can play a pivotal role."" Another display shows how Qingtian county in Zhejiang province has a system which enables fish to be raised in watered rice fields. In Aohan banner (a county-level region) in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region, farmers grow millet the same way that they have been doing for thousands of years. Archaeological discoveries show that the local people began to grow millet, almost 8,000 years ago, the earliest known cultivation of the cereal crop in the world. One of the discoveries shows how Turpan, in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, had an underground channel called karez dating back 2,000 years that was used for irrigation in the arid region. ""All these agricultural systems are examples of how the Chinese sought harmony between heaven and earth, as advocated in (their) philosophy,"" says Dai Jun, a supervisor from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs. ""Many popular modern ideas, like organic food, can also trace their roots to such ancient practices,"" he says. One of the displays showcases rice fields in the west of Beijing, that have been in existence for over 300 years. In imperial times, the fields were a key source of food for the royal families in the capital city. Now, at just 1.3 square kilometers, the field is still cultivated.,""The area of the field is greatly reduced,"" says Dai. ""Fortunately, some parts survive today to show how people grew rice in Beijing in the old days."" Dai says traditional farming areas form the foundation of the nation's culture. For instance, in the Honghe Hani Terrace area, a unique polyphonic chorus genre called Hani-haba (Hani ancient songs) and other intangible cultural heritage is closely connected with people's everyday labor in the field. ""Unlike cultural relics, agricultural heritage systems are still alive,"" Dai explains. ""So, if it disappears, folk art forms, traditional rituals and festivals and old craftsmanship, which are based on farming, will no longer exist. ""This heritage not only belongs to the past, but is essential for the future. ""Now, in a time being dominated by modern agriculture, in which machines and chemicals are widely used, we have to leave other alternatives for future generations."" He also says that the revival of such traditions is a way to alleviate poverty. ""Frankly speaking, some traditional methods are alive in regions that are relatively less developed and face poverty,"" says Dai. ""So, we can use this heritage to improve local livelihoods."" However, protection of heritage does not mean keeping everything as it is. ""So, while large-scale mechanization is not advisable, management can be improved, and better breeds of farm animals can be introduced to boost economic value."" Meanwhile, an expanded list of China's key agricultural heritage systems will be released next year, says Dai, and the clamor for national heritage site status will benefit farmers and boost food safety. Separately, China's efforts to protect agricultural heritage has been recognized overseas. According to Tang Shengyao, the deputy head of the international cooperation department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, China now owns 15 Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems, including the Honghe Hani Rice Terrace; the Qingtian's Rice and Fish Culture, and the Aohan Dryland Farming System-placing it at the top of the table for such systems. The GIAHS program was initiated by the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization in 2002, and so far there are 52 entries from 21 countries. Speaking about how China sees the process, Tang says: ""China has released a national rule to regulate the heritage systems, and has established a supervision center overseeing their protection. We are the first country to do so, and we've gained great social, economic and cultural benefits."" So far, delegates from nearly 70 countries have come to China to learn GIAHS-related work, Tang adds. Work has also been done to promote the exchange of experiences between Chinese and foreign counterparts on similar projects. For example, a cooperation agreement has been reached between Fuzhou Jasmine and Tea Culture System in Fujian province and wine regions in Burgundy, France. The same is true for the Xinghua Duotian water-land agro-system in Jiangsu province and the Chinampa system in Mexico-floating artificial islands that have been used for agricultural production since Aztec times.

0,"Feeling stifled at home, many members of Hong Kong's artistic community are moving to Beijing and other mainland cities, where audiences are eager to explore innovative ideas and performances. Miriam Zhang reports. Beijing is experiencing an immigration boom of sorts, as artists from Hong Kong head to the city in search of opportunities they are unlikely to find at home. The exodus has been spurred by increasing artistic freedom in the capital and the government's preferential policies for artists, not to mention the Chinese mainland's huge market for visual and performing arts. In Hong Kong, Gary Mok Waihong was just a wannabe artist. He loved art, but was never going to make it in his home city. Today, he owns a studio in Beijing and is a full-time artist and curator of shows, including exhibitions in Hong Kong, Macao and the mainland. He worked hard to get where he is. After many years of study, he completed preparations for art school in time to become one of the first students from Hong Kong to graduate from the bachelor's program at the Central Academy of Fine Arts, China's leading visual arts institute, in 2007. Having arrived in Beijing in 2000, Mok revels in a cultural melting pot, where new ideas are embraced with enthusiasm and curiosity, and people with diverse talents have the opportunity to express themselves and develop. ""There are some intriguing art groups in Beijing. Even heavy metal music is more advanced here than in Hong Kong. It would be hard to find a similar group of people that come together regularly for art in the Hong Kong arts community,"" he said. Much changed in the years after his arrival. Other ""creatives"" followed his path to find their place in Beijing's artistic community, including painters, dancers, singers, actors and screenwriters. The process is continuing as young hopefuls arrive in search of opportunities unavailable at home.,Mok always dreamed of being an artist, but the nearest he got in Hong Kong was working for a design company. In 1995, when he graduated from high school, he applied to the Chinese University of Hong Kong, the only school in the city that offered a program in visual arts. However, he failed the Chinese-language exam, so he wasn't chosen. Later, he was desperate to attend the prestigious academy in Beijing, but at the time it wasn't taking students from Hong Kong. Even after Hong Kong returned to the motherland in 1997, there were no openings for the city's students at the academy. The restrictions were lifted in 2001, when new policies opened the doors to young artists from Hong Kong and Macao. Mok finally had his chance, but he had to demonstrate that he had talent. He was assessed in sketching, speed drawing and color blending - the prerequisites for admission - but he really wasn't ready for all that. As far as he was concerned, he was a lowly office worker at a design company with no formal art education, and he would be competing for a place alongside students from across China, many of whom had been honing their skills all their lives. He failed to gain a place, so he signed up for remedial classes. ""I was the only student from Hong Kong, and also the most senior,"" he recalled, adding that the other students, who were all much younger, called him ""uncle."" It was three years before Mok mastered the requisite skills. Having finally been accepted by the academy, he swept through his bachelor's degree and went on to study for a master's.,Today, students from Hong Kong who want to follow their art school dream have an easier ride because institutions across the mainland welcome promising young people from the city. According to the Office of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China in Beijing, about 70 students from the city are enrolled at the three top art schools on the mainland: the Central Conservatory of Music; the Central Academy of Drama; and the Central Academy of Fine Arts. The number of students is expected to rise after the three schools joined the Scheme for Admission of Hong Kong Students to Mainland Higher Education Institutions this year. Under the program, students from Hong Kong can apply directly to the three schools. Provided they pass the auditions or assessments, they will simply have to submit their results from the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education Examination as part of their application. By the start of the year, 112 mainland universities had signed up for the program, 10 more than last year. The program has seen 10,185 Hong Kong students enroll since it started in 2012, with most studying finance, medicine and engineering. Gong Wan, director of the China Education Exchange (Hong Kong) Centre, expects to see a rise in the number of students from Hong Kong applying to mainland arts institutions. Speaking at an education expo in Hong Kong in February, Zhang Feiran, from the admissions office of the Central Academy of Drama, said the school received 50 applications from Hong Kong at the beginning of the current academic year, and seven applicants were offered places. Next year, under the education exchange program, the number of applicants from Hong Kong is expected to at least double.,In Beijing, the enthusiasm for novelty has opened doors for niche artists such as Tsang Tsz-kin, who teaches contact improvisation, a form of modern dance. Having accompanied his wife when she was transferred to Beijing from Hong Kong two years ago, Tsang initially resigned himself to being a stay-at-home house husband. Instead, he runs a contact improvisation workshop, and attracts new students by promoting his program through social media platforms such as WeChat. ""I teach eight classes every week. That would never have happened in Hong Kong."" he said. The numbers tell the story. For example, in 2017, the gross take for performing arts at box offices across the mainland was 17.6 billion yuan ($2.57 billion), while in Hong Kong it was HK$506 million ($64.5 million), according to the China Association of Performing Arts and the Hong Kong Arts Development Council. After graduating from the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts, Tsang opened his own studio to teach performance art in the city. Although he did pretty well, he grew weary of the repetitive teaching routine. ""Being a teacher became a job, not a career."" he said. He became involved with contact improvisation 20 years ago, regarding the form as a way of liberating dancers from repetitive gestures by replacing them with movements between people in contact. Tsang found it hard to promote the dance form at home. ""It wasn't until I left Hong Kong that I realized people there are very conservative,"" he said. He added that some of his students seemed more concerned with winning awards than performing dance moves. In addition, he found that Hong Kong audiences didn't really appreciate his art. According to the Hong Kong Annual Arts Survey report, published in November by the Hong Kong Arts Development Council, audience numbers at dance performances in the city were the lowest among all forms of performance art, including music, theater and opera. The numbers fell for five consecutive years, from 271,000 in 2012 to 213,000 in 2017. Tsang has experienced big changes during his two years in Beijing, where audiences are enthusiastic and enjoy his contact improvisation dance. ""If they don't know about a new thing, they are willing to learn and figure it out."" he said. He has become active in the mainland's contact improvisation community: ""I know this dance form is drawing audiences in big cities in addition to Beijing, such as Shanghai, Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang province, and Chongqing."" He has also been impressed by the receptiveness of audiences in lower-tier cities. He recalled the time he was invited to share his skills at a workshop in Xi'an, capital of Shaanxi province, one of the biggest cities in northwest China. Many of those attending had traveled from smaller cities, such as Lanzhou, capital of Gansu province, and Yinchuan, capital of the Ningxia Hui autonomous region. ""Those people were willing to spend more than two days traveling to another city just to learn about something new. That was really precious,"" Tsang said. In July, the China National Arts Fund announced that practitioners from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan had been invited to apply for financial support, which could amount to as much as 4 million yuan per project. The practitioners are also eligible for training programs subsidized by the fund, while arts organizations on the mainland are being encouraged to work with Hong Kong's art institutions to promote creative synergy and cultural exchanges. Established in 2013, the arts fund has awarded 11.3 million yuan through seven art exchange projects related to Hong Kong, and artists from the city have participated in 15 national projects supported by the funding. In 2017, Cheng Shing-tai, a 42-year-old conductor from Hong Kong, joined a project at the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing. The monthlong program gave him the opportunity to work with 17 musicians from different provinces and with the China National Traditional Orchestra, the country's leading ensemble of its kind. Cheng was the only student in his master's class for conductors of Chinese music at the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts. ""Our faculty was established in 2011, but the education facilities and teaching resources are relatively poor,"" he said. The exchange project gave him more opportunities to practice his skills. Cheng was excited when he learned the national funding was open to artists from Hong Kong, and said he would definitely apply if he could find suitable projects. Nurturing cultural talent and promoting exchanges among arts groups have been written into the blueprint for the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, which was released by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, China's Cabinet, in February. In the meantime, local artists will continue to cross the border to seek their fortunes on the mainland."
1,"BEIJING -- President Xi Jinping on Wednesday met with Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari who had attended the 2018 Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC). Thanks to the joint efforts by China and Africa, the summit concluded successfully, further enriching the China-Africa comprehensive strategic and cooperative partnership. It was a meeting with historic significance to China-Africa solidarity and cooperation, Xi said. Noting that Nigeria is a major African country and an essential partner to China in Africa, Xi said he attaches great importance to the development of China-Nigeria relations, which have reached a stage of growth unmatched in history. China appreciates the Nigerian government's commitment to the one-China policy and is ready to continue its mutual understanding and support with the Nigerian side on issues involving each other's core interests and major concerns, Xi said. Nigeria is welcome to participate in the Belt and Road construction. China is willing to deepen cooperation with Nigeria in fields such as infrastructure, agriculture and production capacity, enhance people-to-people and cultural exchanges, and support Nigeria's economic and social development so that the bilateral cooperation can become a model for China-Africa cooperation, Xi said. Buhari congratulated China on the success of the FOCAC Beijing summit.,The FOCAC has become an important platform for creating a brighter future for 2.6 billion African and Chinese. Nigeria will work with other FOCAC members to implement the outcomes of the summit, he said. Buhari expressed gratitude to China for its concrete assistance to Nigeria's economic and social development. With China's help, Nigeria obtained a light rail, the first of its kind in West Africa, which fully reflected China's technology, quality and speed, he said. The Nigerian side appreciates the Belt and Road Initiative, which will lay an important foundation for Africa and China to achieve win-win cooperation and common development. Nigeria is willing to participate in the Belt and Road cooperation, he said. After the meeting, the two presidents witnessed the signing of cooperation documents."
0,"Big data plays a growing role in China's tourism. Xu Lin reports. The tips independent travelers regularly share online are providing the tourism industry with a growing trove of big data about destinations, restaurants and hotels. Travelers are increasingly making decisions based on internet reviews, so digital reputations are becoming increasingly important. And they're being quantified as more big data analysis is being applied to the tourism sector. Beijing International Studies University recently released a top 10 list of China's AAAAA scenic areas based on big data analyses of their online reputations. It also presented five awards in such areas as service and environment to these sites. (AAAAA is the National Tourism Administration's highest rating.) Beijing's Temple of Heaven, Fujian province's earthen buildings and Shanxi province's ancient city of Pingyao made the list. The list was presented at the third annual Meeting of Smart Tourism and Marketing hosted by the university. Tourism experts and representatives of scenic spots and travel companies attended.,BISU's Tourism Big Data Center analyzed over 500,000 tourist reviews of all of China's 250 AAAAA Scenic Areas posted between January and early November on such major online travel platforms as Ctrip and Mafengwo. They sorted the reviews into 10 categories, including transportation, safety and public-toilet signage. China's 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-20) calls for an evaluation system of tourism destinations focusing on travelers' reviews. It also calls for the creation of a catalogue of excellent tourism providers and the promotion of their brands. A China Tourism Academy report shows over 62 million Chinese traveled overseas in the first half of the year, 5 percent more than during the same period of 2016. Nearly 70 million overseas tourists visited China in the first six months of 2017. ""Online reputations reflect travelers' comments about scenic spots in a relatively objective way,"" BISU's Tourism Big Data Center's executive director Deng Ning says. ""Our analyses will help scenic areas improve management and service, and to better market themselves."",Big data enables strategic decision making, he explains. For instance, it shows the peak and low seasons, so providers can boost numbers during downtimes, using tactics such as cutting ticket prices. But China's tourism industry's big data analysis is still in its infancy. ""Big data can be used to summarize tourists' consumption and behaviors, and contribute to academic research of the tourism industry,"" BISU School of Tourism Management professor Zhang Lingyun says. ""The boom in social-networking platforms will produce more user-generated content, and their comments and travel experiences will largely affect others' decisions."" Experts also discussed the development of China's smart tourism and information-technology applications. Artificial intelligence is the future of smart tourism, Zhang says. He suggests such possibilities as unmanned transportation and automated tour guides. Already, augmented - and virtual-reality technologies can be used to vividly render ancient ruins' original splendor.,BES Woniu (Beijing) Tourist Attraction Management Co Ltd chair Xu Ting recalls his unique experience of using facial-recognition technology upon entering Wuzhen, a popular destination in Zhejiang province. The ancient water town is also celebrated as an IT hub. ""It's an inspiration to explore new ways of ticket-checking,"" he says. ""And artificial intelligence will optimize the management of scenic areas. The problem of management should be used to plan smart scenic areas. For example, big data analyses can measure scenic spots' capacity to accept visitors and vehicles."" Xu believes scenic areas will be better able to efficiently deploy such resources as staff and shuttle buses to avoid problems like overcrowding if tourists are able to book tickets online in advance. He suggests scenic areas offer platforms for consultation, interaction, mobile payment and online promotion. Beijing founded a tourism-industry big data center in partnership with the travel agency China CYTS Tours and mobile-data-service platform TalkingData this spring. The center crunches data about visitor demographics, such as where they come from. Indeed, big data will increasingly expand its role in China's travel sector. It's poised to go beyond assessing reputations based on travelers' reviews to ensuring these reputations are increasingly deserved by improving their services.

1,"Beijing Lanxum Technology Co Ltd, part of the first batch of educational technology companies listed on the growth enterprise market, just signed a deal with Beijing Normal University to deepen their cooperation in Chinese literature and culture research and teaching. This is the company's latest effort to improve their products, after its acquisition of Chinese Future in February for 481 million yuan ($72.7 million). The deal was regarded as a win-win, as both companies have rich experience teaching Chinese traditional culture and literature courses. Education was one of the most active sectors for investors last year. Industry statistics show education-related spending accounted for 3 to 19 percent of family income. The market scale of the education industry is around 2.24 trillion yuan, among which the preschool education sector takes 380 billion yuan and primary and middle school account for 680 billion yuan. As projected, the annual net profit of Chinese Future as a subsidiary of Lanxum will not be less than 60 million yuan, 78 million yuan, 101 million yuan and 132 million yuan respectively in the following four years."
0,"A Beijing theater company is proving that attracting the young to an old form - those more prone to watch reality TV or read comics - is not a lost cause. Traditionalists often lament that ancient Chinese art forms are under threat in the face of contemporary entertainment, but there has been a surge in popularity of the ancient art among young Chinese audiences in small theaters. Peking Opera, or jingju, has a history of more than 200 years, and in 2010 UNESCO declared it an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. It brings together art forms including singing, dancing, martial arts and acrobatics, and its resurgence in small theaters is notable in that Peking Opera is usually performed in large theaters and includes grand scenes such as battlefields and royal courts. It is mostly enjoyed by elder audiences. Star Theater is one of the small theaters in Beijing in which many of the smaller Peking Opera shows are being staged. With three theaters, each with a capacity of about 200 seats, Star Theater will stage five Peking Opera productions from March 22 to 31. The five works, presented by the Jingju Theatre Company of Beijing, will be staged as part of the 40th anniversary of the company, which was jointly founded by Peking Opera masters including Mei Lanfang (1894-1961) and Ma Lianliang (1901-66). One of the shows, Yan Xijiao, is a 70-minute production that premiered in 2013 and was the directorial debut work of the Peking Opera scriptwriter and director Li Zhuoqun. The story is an adaptation of the 14th-century Chinese classic novel Water Margin by Shi Nai'an and is about the leading female character, Yan Xijiao, the concubine of district official Song Jiang, and Yan's secret lover, Song's apprentice Zhang Wenyuan.,The show has been staged more than 60 times in small theaters around the country and has stood out from other Peking Opera shows in becoming popular among younger audiences. ""Members of the creative team are about the same age as the audience, mostly people born after 1980 and 1990,"" says Li, asked why the audiences can connect with the stories her works present. ""We've all grown up watching the same cartoons, TV shows and listening to the same music, so we all have the same reference points. We keep the shows' plotlines simple because it's easier for the audience to understand. There are also fewer roles in the shows than in big-budget shows."" Li's second Peking Opera work, A Love Beyond, will also be staged at Star Theater. It had its premiere in 2014 and is adapted from the novel Grinding the Jade Bodhisattva, a love story written by an anonymous author from the Song Dynasty (960-1279). Li, 32, born in Linfen, Shanxi province, was introduced to traditional Chinese opera by her family, who all worked for a local folk opera troupe. She started learning Peking Opera and local folk operas as a child. Her grandfather taught her to write Chinese by using lyrics from Peking Opera pieces. One of her hobbies as a child was to watch rehearsals in the theater. Li received a bachelor's degree in dramatic literature from the National Academy of Chinese Theater Arts and then a master's degree in theater directing. After graduating she joined the Jingju Theatre Company of Beijing in 2011 as a scriptwriter and director. Like many young Chinese, Li is a fan of American and South Korean TV dramas. The scenes from TV dramas such as falling in love at first sight and reunion inspired Li to adapt classic love stories into her own interpretation or to create her own romance.,However, apart from the acclaim she has received from younger people, she has also run into flak from older people, some of whom question her loyalty to the old art form. ""When you look at Peking Opera over the past 200 years you can see it's not something that is locked in the past like an exhibit sitting in a museum,"" Li says. ""It keeps changing thanks to the older generation of Peking Opera masters dedicated to keeping it alive and relevant. Different Peking Opera shows are enjoyed by people of different ages. Contemporary young audiences, especially those new to Peking Opera, may be attracted to shows in small theaters."" The Peking Opera actress Suo Mingfang has played leading female roles in Li's productions for small theaters, including in Li's latest production, Hero Wu Song, which premiered in Beijing in August. She will play the leading role of A Love Beyond staged at Star Theater on March 24 and 25. ""I can still recall the first time when I played at small theater,"" says Suo, 35, who joined the Jingju Theatre Company of Beijing in 2006 after graduating from the National Academy of Chinese Theater Arts. ""The audiences sat so close to the stage that I could even hear the sound of their breath. Just as with traditional shows in big theaters, Peking Opera shows in small theaters are rooted deeply in the old art form, such as how the actors move and sing on stage, but we try to make the shows more contemporary, such as the way in which the stories are told."" Han Yuechao, a Star Theater producer, says: ""I don't think Peking Opera is old-fashioned at all. Putting on Peking Opera in small theaters not only means less space than in big theaters but also allows young directors, scriptwriters and actors to experiment with the old art form. Young people are open to various art forms. They are drawn to fresh ideas relating to this traditional art form and are connected to the stories, which resonate with our daily lives."" Star Theater, founded 10 years ago this year, was the first of its kind in Beijing and has become a magnet for drama aficionados, which is the first of its kind in the capital. It staged more than 600 shows last year, pulling in a more than 100,000 people.,In 2014 Star Theater launched Xiqu Opera Black Box Festival, which gathers about 20 traditional Chinese opera shows by troupes from around the country every year. Han, the project coordinator of the festival, says social media platforms are an important channel in communicating with young people. Audiences are invited to learn about the story lines of each show. For children, Star Theater also offers programs such as painting Peking Opera masks and wearing costumes. Ticket prices are kept afford-able at 100 yuan ($14.9), which has also helped bring in the crowds. Ma Qian Po Shui, a Peking Opera show directed by the theater veterans Zhang Manjun, is regarded as the first Peking Opera show made for small theaters. The opera, premiered in 2000 and performed by actors of the Jingju Theatre Company of Beijing, including Yang Shaopeng and Zheng Xiao, tells the story of a troubled couple during the Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 220), the wife, disgruntled with her life, leaving her husband. After he gains an official position and success she wants to return to him but he spurns her. ""What really impressed audiences were the fresh approaches to story telling, such as flashback and interposed narration,"" says Bai Ailian, the director of the latest version of Ma Qian Po Shui. ""But they were also drawn in by themes touched on in the show, such as the causes of friction in a marriage and how money can subvert a marriage."" Star Theater will stage the show on March 26 and 27, featuring the same actors from the original version of the show. ""Though it's a Peking Opera show, audiences love it because they feel connected,"" Bai says, adding that the music also differs to that of traditional Peking Opera. In one scene the husband recalls the good days when the couple had just married. The guzheng is the only musical instrument played onstage, rather than the traditional gong and drum.,""The audience follows the husband's memories but suddenly, the music stops, which pulls both the husband and the audience back to reality,"" Bai says. ""Only in small theaters can that kind of intimacy between actors and audiences be created."" Bai, who graduated from Central Academy of Drama with a PhD in directing in 2003, directed her first Peking Opera show, Six Records of a Floating Life, for small theaters in 2008. Based on the memoir by the Chinese writer Shen Fu from the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), the Peking Opera production, Six Records of a Floating Life, follows Shen's memories about his dead wife. ""Traditional Peking Opera shows portray romance against the backdrop of wars or linked with the survival of a nation,"" Bai says. ""Six Records of a Floating Life depicts love between husband and wife, which is not commonly seen."""
0,"Preschool education in China has never been so subject to public scrutiny as during the past month following a slew of allegations of mistreatment in early childcare facilities in a number of cities, including Beijing and Shanghai.  The latest allegations concern a kindergarten in Beijing operated by RYB Education, a listed company in New York. Parents circulated photos showing what they claimed were needle marks on their children's skin.  The claims followed an incident at a prekindergarten in Shanghai, where parents distributed video footage they said showed teachers beating toddlers and force-feeding them wasabi.  The alleged incidents have sparked an unprecedented public outcry nationwide, with parents asking that if such things can occur at high-end facilities in the country's most developed and international cities, what might be happening in second-and third-tier cities or the most isolated areas?  Many say the mistreatment of children by professionals is not restricted to isolated cases, but is a systemic problem that arose during the rapid expansion of the childcare and education sectors, and there is no quick fix.  For most of its history, China was a largely agrarian society where there was little need for formal early childhood education as children were usually cared for within the extended family.  Kindergartens - in China, that means facilities for children ages 3 to 6 - only began emerging toward the end of the last century, mainly catering to affluent urban families.  The situation started changing in the 1980s when the economy started to take off and society became increasingly mobile. Millions of migrant workers moved to the cities, leaving children in the care of older relatives. Demand for kindergartens grew rapidly in urban areas as the extended family dwindled and no one was available to care for the children while their parents worked.  Meanwhile, as primary and secondary school education became increasingly competitive, many parents succumbed to the pressure and sought schooling options earlier and earlier. ""Do not let the child lose at the starting line!"" is one of the most popular slogans in contemporary China.  As a result, the early education industry has exploded. Last year, there were 44 million registered kindergartners, up from 34.5 million in 2011, and while the government has supported that growth, both financially and with favorable policies, demand far outstrips supply.  In 2013, the Ministry of Education set the full-time kindergarten staff-to-student ratio at 1-to-5, but it is now closer to 1-to-20. The gap is likely to grow after the government introduced the second-child policy last year.  By 2021, China will have an extra 15 million preschoolers, while the shortfall of preschool teachers and childcare workers will surpass 3 million, according to a 2016 study conducted by the Chinese Fund for the Humanities and Social Sciences. The latest available statistics show that nearly 210,000 students majored in preschool education in 2009, and although the number is expected to have risen in recent years, it will still take years to close the gap.  The pinch is mostly felt by private kindergartens, which account for at least 50 percent of the total yet lag far behind public facilities in terms of financial support and other resources.  As a result, in the absence of qualified instructors these kindergartens often hire unqualified staff members; the ministry's statistics show that 22.4 percent of preschool teachers in China have only been educated to high school standard at most.  A report on china.org quoted a kindergarten principal from Jinan, Shandong province, as saying that once these unqualified teachers ""find that the children are not as cute and naive as they had imagined, lacking better training they will simply treat them improperly"".  Moreover, parents, who in extreme cases have to struggle in a competitive environment to secure a kindergarten spot for their child, have to take whatever is offered.  Insiders believe that fixing the situation will require a clear understanding of the causes of the shortage of qualified professionals, which include a lack of respect for the profession, poor salaries and the resultant low popularity of training courses.  As a relatively new profession, early childhood educators have lower social status to their primary and secondary school counterparts. Many people, especially the older generation, consider them to be little more than nannies, whose duties can easily be replicated.  ""Few people understand that preschool education is more than physical care; it is also emotionally and intellectually demanding,"" said Liu Qing, a 23-year-old journalist. In 2015, as an intern at a local paper, Liu spent a month working undercover in four Beijing kindergartens to collect first-hand information about early childhood education.  In her account of the experience, she described how she easily passed all the interviews when posing as a high school graduate, and detailed the physical exhaustion and emotional frustration that resulted from working almost 14 hours a day. At one point, when challenged by a group of unruly children, Liu, who had long considered herself a child lover, found herself roughly pushing a child aside.  ""I survived the experience only by telling myself time and time again that 'This is not my real job and I'll leave it soon,'"" she wrote.  It costs nearly 5,000 yuan ($755) a month to enroll a child at the RYB kindergarten in Beijing at the center of the most recent allegations, but most of its teachers are paid an average of 3,650 yuan a month. By comparison, a live-in nanny earns about 5,000 yuan a month in China's major cities.  The failure to recognize preschool teaching as a profession has resulted in difficulties attracting and retaining talented people.  Hu Ke, 25, opted to study preschool education at a key university, but most of her classmates were transferred to the course because they failed to meet the academic requirements of their desired majors.  As one of the few who chose to work as an early childhood educator upon graduation, Hu remembers the shock in her classmates' eyes when she announced her decision.  Having spent five years employed at a public kindergarten, working 12-hour shifts and earning 5,000 yuan a month, she plans to quit next year.  ""I love children - so what?"" she said. ""I simply can't carry on anymore. I really hope society can learn to value the profession a little more.""  In a column published on Tencent Dajia, a popular online social topics forum, education expert Yin Jianli wrote: ""Teachers are among the most vital and valuable resources a kindergarten can offer; without them other resources are meaningless.""  Xiong Bingqi, deputy director of the 21st Century Education Research Institute in Beijing, shares that opinion. However, he noted that while the government and society have rushed to build more kindergartens to accommodate the growing younger population, the question of how to attract and retain qualified professionals to ensure top-quality care has only recently risen to the top of the agenda.  Teachers' salaries account for only a small percentage of early childhood education expenditures, especially in private kindergartens, and while many people blame the profit motive, some insiders see it as a systemic problem.  Despite rising investment by the government and parents, early childhood educational institutions remain underfunded compared with primary and lower secondary education, according to a paper recently published in the International Journal of Educational Development.  The authors found that public financial support constituted less than 30 percent of the total investment in early childhood education, with most institutions relying on off-budget revenue sources, such as fees and levies.  Tight budgets have been further diluted by the rise in costs associated with other expenditure, especially rents, which can be astronomical in some cities. By the time the money trickles down to the teachers there isn't much left.  ""If the teachers are not treated fairly and with dignity, how can you expect them to do the same to the children?"" Xiong said.  Jing Yishan, a well-known social commentator, said these factors and the lax supervision of kindergartens explain why the installation of surveillance cameras in the kindergartens at the center of the claims in Beijing and Shanghai didn't prevent the teachers from allegedly hurting toddlers.  The installation of closed-circuit cameras is meaningless unless there are watchful eyes behind them, he said.  According to Jing, while both education authorities and parents can serve as those eyes, in practice, the parents' rights can't be guaranteed because preschool education remains a seller's market.  In the recent cases, the local governments responded promptly, firing and even detaining teachers and administrators.  The installation of surveillance cameras at kindergartens is now compulsory, and permanent inspectors have been hired to oversee kindergartens in the two cities. The State Council, China's Cabinet, has also dispatched inspectors nationwide to check teachers' ethics and working methods.  Experts believe greater recognition of the contributions and value of early childhood educators, specifically through a pay rise, would be the first step to addressing the underlying problems.  Xiong urged better funding of early childhood education, along with a revised mechanism to attract more investment and ensure better treatment of the teachers.  Bi Yinghu, an early childhood education expert at the University of Macao, suggested the government should establish a special fund and also set a minimum salary requirement to ensure teachers are paid fairly.  Xiong is in favor of higher wages for preschool teachers, but stresses that long-term solutions must be found to eradicate the problem for good.  ""This (a pay rise) would just serve as a start,"" he said."
1,"BEIJING — Although winter vacation has come, 11-year-old Wang Aoyun still goes to school every day, for skating. As school athletes, Wang and 20-plus teammates practice speed skating on a cornfield-turned ice rink at Taipingzhuang Central School in Beijing's Yanqing district. In three years, the 2022 Winter Olympics will be held in Beijing and Zhangjiakou, Hebei province. While construction of stadiums and infrastructure projects has been accelerated, winter sports and the related economy at the venues have also been heating up.,With its ice rink built in 2016, Taipingzhuang school is the first that had an ice rink in Yanqing district, where competitions of alpine skiing, bobsled, skeleton, and luge will be held in 2022. Teachers take shifts to water the ice rink every night in winter, said Ding Jianpei, principal of the school. ""Most of our students may not be engaged in winter sports in the future, but we think it's worth it if they feel the happiness in the sports,"" Ding said. Winter sports used to be a luxury 20 years ago in Beijing. People had to travel hundreds of miles to find a ski slope. The first large ski resort in the Chinese capital, Shijinglong, was not open until the late 1990s, in Yanqing.,Local villager Guo Junhua, 35, was among the first batch of ski lovers. Last year, she quit her job as a ski coach in southwest China and opened a ski training school in Yanqing District. To date, she has trained 50 children. The district government also encourages local people to learn winter sports. ""Influenced by the atmosphere of the Winter Olympics, more and more residents show up on ice rinks and ski fields,"" said Ma Zhiyong, sports bureau deputy chief of Yanqing District, adding that more ice rinks and ski training bases are mushrooming. This winter, Shijinglong resort received 60,000 visitors, up 10 percent year on year. Five km away from the 2022 alpine skiing competition venue, local resident Zhang Haichao has rented and decorated 10 households, with more being constructed. Zhang, general manager of a homestay brand company, is confident about the prospective of homestay market near his hometown. ""My friends and I love skiing, but bringing heavy snowboards to hotels is very inconvenient,"" Zhang said. ""Now that the Winter Olympics are coming, more visitors will come to ski, a golden opportunity for homestay business."",He is also consulting some ski gear companies, planning to offer ski gear renting service at his homestay houses. The district has attracted over 120 homestay brands, with the reservation rate of some brands reaching 90 percent for the Lunar New Year, said Zheng Aijuan, deputy director of Yanqing's tourism commission. Song Haitian, deputy director of Winter Olympics preparation office of Yanqing District, said the 2022 Winter Olympics would have a profound impact on Yanqing's development. ""We hope the global sports event not only stimulates the sustainable development of Yanqing, especially the winter economy, but also helps upgrade the quality of both people's health and civil society,"" Song said."
0,"The Spring Festival travel rush - the largest human migration in the world - is in full swing, and it is estimated that nearly 3 billion trips will be made via cars, buses, trains and planes as people across the country visit their families to celebrate the most important festival of the year. China Daily reporters spoke to four travelers to discover how they planned their journeys, plus a woman who has bucked the trend by deciding to stay in Beijing instead of visiting her family. Two months ago when the duty roster was handed out, Zhong Zhaoshuang was thrilled to see that her last shift in the Year of Rooster will be on a train that will arrive in Guangzhou, Guangdong province, at 8 am on Feb 15, which is Spring Festival Eve. The timing meant she could invite her parents to travel from Harbin, capital of the northeastern province of Heilongjiang, to visit her in her apartment in the southern metropolis so they can celebrate Lunar New Year together. She has rarely been as lucky, because since she started on the rail network in 2005, Zhong has spent nine out of 12 Lunar New Year's Eve's working. ""For train stewards, four days on trains followed by two days' rest is the norm. Only the lucky ones finish work in time for the family reunion feast at the end of the year,"" said the 34-year-old head steward, who works for the China Railway Guangzhou Group. As millions of Chinese head home for the festival, the rail network will be under pressure to cope with the largest annual human migration on the globe. According to the National Development and Reform Commission, nearly 3 billion trips are expected to be made during the 40 day travel rush for the festival, and more than 390 million of them will be by train. Apart from their two-day breaks, railway employees are not allowed to ask for leave during the festival period. ""When I started working, I thought spending the day away from home was cool. But when I saw thousands of Chinese brave all the difficulties to make it home, I started to miss my family,"" she said. In 2005, when Zhong graduated from a railway college in Harbin, Heilongjiang, she joined the railway company. At first, she worked on slow trains, but she was promoted to the post of head steward on a bullet train five years later after passing several exams, including one on emergency procedures. ""On the slower trains, there were so many people in the carriages that passengers on the platform had to use windows to get onto the train,"" she said. ""We could not move on the train, either. I remember once we collected six bags of trash from just one carriage after the passengers disembarked."" During the Spring Festival travel rush, passengers bring more and heavier luggage. Zhong said she has seen migrant workers bringing buckets full of eggs on the train, and even a TV set once. ""Those were the New Year gifts they were taking home. I felt obliged to help them guard their New Year gifts,"" she said. And when the clock strikes midnight, signaling New Year, she said the passengers - irrespective of where they come from or what they do for a living - all take out their phones and dial their families and loved ones. ""I always call my parents first. I am their only child and I know they will be waiting for my call,"" she said. ByLi Lei,When Ni Chenyang began preparing for his Spring Festival trip home, he was uncertain whether he could find a method of transport that would allow him to arrive in time for the family reunion dinner on New Year's Eve, which falls on Thursday this year. However, having booked a flight, the 3,512 kilometer journey from Beijing to Altay prefecture, Xinjiang Uyghur autonomous region, seems less daunting than during his student days when he took the train. ""I felt like I would be racing against the sun on my way home,"" the 26-year-old said. ""However, thanks to the convenience of air travel, I will just about make it. Before landing his job as an accounts clerk at a State-owned bank, Ni studied at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing for six years. His limited funds meant he always traveled home to Altay by train, even though the journey took about 39 hours, including a one-night stopover in Urumqi, the regional capital, before he continued his journey on a branch line. ""It's hard to get a ticket during the Spring Festival travel rush, so I usually try to do it several days in advance,"" he said. ""When I was in college, I had more time and therefore more options."" To avoid the crowds, he usually chose to return home before the travel rush began, but it wasn't easy to endure the journey. ""There are about 20 stops on the trip. So many people boarded the train and walked up and down with their heavy luggage that I could barely sleep at night,"" he said. This year, he bought air tickets two weeks ahead of the holiday travel rush. He has been working at the bank for two years and has taken few vacations during that time. Ni said the Spring Festival holiday is significant because it gives him an entire week to spend with family and friends he rarely sees. His journey will comprise four flights in total. He will fly from Beijing to Urumqi, where he will wait for one hour before changing planes and heading to Altay. At the end of his visit, he will repeat the process in the opposite direction. His tickets for the four flights cost 6,000 yuan in total. That's roughly twice the usual fare because airlines raise their prices during the Spring Festival travel period in response to heightened demand. He earns about 8,000 yuan ($1,270) a month, so the air tickets cost about 80 percent of his salary in January. ""I am happy to know that my parents will be waiting for me at the end of my exhausting 10 hour trip,"" Ni said. ""I will be so happy to be home."" By Xin Wen,Chen Sheping, 48, who works in a clothing factory in Tianjin, spent almost 27 hours getting back to Xiangyang, his hometown in Hubei province, by bus, train and taxi. ""My company rented a bus to transport some employees to Beijing West Railway Station (a journey of about 115 kilometers), so we could board our trains,"" he said. ""So, I arrived in Beijing on Wednesday afternoon and took an express train at midnight. I reached Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, on Thursday afternoon, and then took a bus and a taxi to my home in rural Xiangyang, I finally arrived home at 6 pm on Thursday,"" he said. Chen and his wife lived and worked in Xinjian, a village in Beijing's Daxing district, for about 20 years. However, in November, a fire broke out in their overcrowded apartment building, which housed more than 400 people, that resulted in the deaths of 19 people and eight serious injuries. In response, the authorities launched a 40 day campaign to eradicate safety risks, including fire hazards in crowded buildings which served as dormitories, storage areas and workshops. Chen was among many people classified as working in an unsafe environment, so the company was closed down. He later found a job in Tianjin, but his wife still works in Beijing. ""That's why I bought train tickets from Beijing, not Tianjin. I had to meet my wife first and we traveled back to our hometown together,"" he said. Although they departed during the Spring Festival travel rush, Chen said he had no difficulty buying tickets and there were fewer passengers on the train than in previous years. ""I bought the tickets two weeks in advance, but I noticed that there were still some tickets left on Thursday and there were also some empty seats during the trip,"" he said. ""That would have been impossible in the past."" Most of the passengers were migrant workers in Beijing, but he didn't know many of them. In previous years, he often came across workmates on the train and they chatted throughout the journey. ""After the fire in Daxing last year, many migrant workers in Beijing moved to Hebei province to look for work,"" he said. Chen's son, who also works in Beijing, graduated from a university in the capital last year. ""I have stayed away from my hometown too long. My parents have both passed away, and my son isn't there either, which means there's little to worry about in my hometown. I wasn't really looking forward to returning this year,"" Chen said. ""Nowadays, I have few feelings about the reality I'm in, or society and the world I see every day. One reason, I think, is that I'm getting older, and the other is that I stopped worrying too much after the fire last year. That was a truly big event that changed many people's lives."" He now believes the old saying that contentment brings happiness. ""I just hope my family stays healthy and safe next year,"" he said. By Jiang Chenglong,When traveling home for Spring Festival in the past five years, Zhao Xinya has endured extremely crowded rail carriages full of stifling air and horrible smells from the overused toilets. This year, though, the 48-year-old domestic helper has decided to stay in Beijing for the holiday. ""I'm glad I made the decision even though my husband - who lives in Tianshui, my hometown in the west of Gansu province - is not happy about it."" she said. Having spent most of her life in Tianshui, a small town 1,400 kilometers from Beijing, Zhao came to the capital in 2013 to experience a totally new life in the giant city. ""I think the capital is the best - the people, the environment and everything else,"" she said. ""I didn't expect to stay here such a long time."" Even though Beijing has broadened her horizons and brought new meaning to her life after spending more than 10 years selling fruit in her hometown, she still faced the difficult journey back to Gansu every Spring Festival. ""First, it's extremely hard to buy a ticket. My husband and my son used to get up before 6 am and sit in front of the computer holding their cellphones to buy a ticket for me as soon as the online booking facility opened. However, all the tickets to my hometown were usually sold in a few minutes. If I was lucky, I got a seat, but most of the time, I just got a standing-room-only ticket,"" she said. ""I had to stand for 18 to 20 hours on the train. The aisles were full of people, and the long lines to use the toilets were so frustrating - not to mention the smell! The train from Beijing to Tianshui runs at night, which meant Zhao spent the hours of darkness awake and standing up. ""Sometimes, I paid an extra 20 yuan ($3.16) to sit in the dining carriage between dinner and breakfast, which was good because I could lean on the table and rest for a few hours,"" she said. ""However, after all my experiences over the years, I think I have had enough."" Instead of visiting her hometown for Spring Festival, she realized that she didn't have to endure so much for one particular event. Instead, she took a vacation from Dec 15 until Jan 19 and visited her family then. ""I had some time with my husband and son. Now, I will spend our great festival with my client, who needs me here in Beijing,"" she said. Her client is a 90-year-old widower whose wife died five years ago. Since then, he has spent Spring Festival alone. This year, though, Zhao will take him to miaohui, traditional fairs held in parks during the holiday. ""I will cook delicious meals for him to celebrate Spring Festival,"" she said. ""I believe I made a smart choice to avoid the crowds and take better care of him. I'm very much looking forward to my first Lunar New Year in the capital."" By Du Juan,Yang Hua has worked as a cook in Beijing for 11 years. Though he will travel home to Bozhou, Anhui province, for Spring Festival on Wednesday, his preparations for the journey started more than a month ago. Early in January, he started shopping for gifts; he bought his parents and parents-in-law a pair of shoes eac h, and his 7-year-old daughter will receive a toy dog. ""She wanted a toy dog that could 'speak', but it was too expensive. Instead, I bought a regular stuffed one,"" he said. Yang works in a company canteen, earning about 4,000 yuan ($635) a month. His regular day starts at 6 am and lasts until about 2 pm. The 37-year-old's journey home is never easy because he has to take a ""green"" train - the slowest on China's rail network - which leaves at 11pm and takes nine hours to cover the 750 kilometers between the capital and Bozhou. ""It's tiring. I always try to get a sleeper ticket, but I have never succeeded. Some people play cards during the journey, some watch TV on their phones, while others chat. It's too noisy to sleep, so I always stay awake, feeling dizzy and tired,"" he said, adding that the train is usually so crowded that some passengers sit in the toilet because it's the most spacious place. Though he only managed to get a seat, not a sleeper bunk, he still considers himself lucky because this is the first year he has succeeded in buying a ticket on the first day they became available. ""I am clumsy at operating my phone. Every time I tried to get a ticket, I failed because I'm so slow, so I often had to mobilize friends and colleagues to help. They spent days checking the ticket-booking platform to see if anyone had returned a ticket that I could buy,"" he said. Despite the hassle, he is always determined to go home for Spring Festival. He came to Beijing in 2007 with his wife, but she returned to Bozhou in 2011. Yang stays in regular contact with his family, though. ""I have video calls with my daughter at least four times a week,"" he said. He has been considering going home for good. ""I have paid social security contributions for nine years, so I still need to make payments for at least six more years before I can claim my pension. I have to keep working, so I can get my pension,"" he said. He added that when that happens he plans to open a company that will provide wedding services in his hometown, and he has been making preparations for that. Yang is fascinated by xiangsheng, also known as ""crosstalk"", a form of comedic dialogue, and he spends much of his free time writing and sometimes performing his work in small theaters. He hopes to use his skills to amuse guests at weddings, so he works part time for a company that organizes ceremonies in Beijing, and has also learned flower arranging to further his dream. ""I am too far away from home - I want to be close to my family,"" he said. By Hou Liqiang"

Wei said that, while equestrian is not very popular in China, the sport has a strong ornamental value, rich cultural connotation and ritual sense. Statistics show that in 2014 there were around 200 equestrian or riding clubs in China. Now the figure is over 1,500 and rising, with club membership at nearly one million. At the same time, competitions have doubled in the past five years, including events such as Future Star. ""It's the fifth year of this competition and we can see more and more teenagers participating in the sport,” said Yao Ge, the president of Beijing Turf and Equestrian Association. Sabrina Ibanez, secretary-general of the International Federation for Equestrian Sports, said, ""We're seeing that there is now a huge - a big interest in China to promote and to develop the sport.” The equestrian tradition in China dates back several millennia, when chariot conducting was one of the six arts that young Chinese nobles needed to master under the Zhou Dynasty (1122-256 BC). The 2008 Beijing Olympic Games allowed the Chinese people rediscover horse riding as a sport, spurred on by the participation of the only Chinese rider Alex Hua Tian. More recently, other Chinese riders have shown well at the Jakarta Asiad."

Both the painting and pagoda are made up of countless little things－the former by stickers and the latter by toys. Snow White, the Smurfs, Angry Birds, Hello Kitty, fighters from the game Contra, dragons and all recognizable images from pop culture are made of stickers and toys. Ye explains that people visit a temple or church to get spiritual enjoyment, which they now often obtain from going to shopping malls instead. The Beijing-based artist speaks in the context of the pagoda and thangka painting, both of which are important symbols of Tibetan Buddhism. ""The pursuit of happiness is the same. But the destination changes."" Ye started to overlap stickers on her canvases in 2009. Before that, the playful pieces were just decorative material she stuck on her phone and computer. Once she began, she was fascinated with these colorful pieces and produced many paintings featuring them.,  Advertisements, logos, patterns and words of slogans－all elements of daily life across the world－appear on her canvas through stickers. She regularly goes to a wholesale market in Beijing that sells stickers and updates her works frequently. She says she notices how stickers stay topical in pop culture. ""If you want to know what's popular in the world, just go visit a sticker shop,"" says the 45-year-old artist. Sometimes, she says she doesn't even have an idea of the images on the stickers she uses. But she finds the answer from the sellers or collectors of such items. ""It's easy for a viewer to connect with her works, regardless of background or nationality,"" says Zhang Lexing, a gallerist and collector of Ye's works. ""From a distance they look like beautiful pictures with vivid images or abstract patterns. A closer look will show motifs from daily life."" Ye says her works focus on the subject of fullness to show the world rich in goods. People are bombarded with information and commodities but they don't know what they really want. Besides, the artist's works reflect opposing entities: exciting and mundane, hard and soft.,Her sculpture A Thousand Years of Fragrance on display is made of more than 100 marble bottles of perfume and alcohol. She has been collecting bottles, especially ones containing scents, for a decade. Her sculptures seek to show personal memories behind perfumes. The show also displays an installation from Ye's latest series Accumulation of Silence, which has more than 60 rock-shaped cushions placed together. ""We're living in a world bombarded by information. Most of it makes no sense,"" says Ye. The series also includes some sticker paintings, which she is still working on. Placing thousands of little pieces on one canvas is usually time-consuming and tedious. But the process is like meditation for her, she says. Mandala alone took her nearly two months. ""My art centers on the concept of fullness. I hope these popular motifs will let people think about their own lives－and what they really want in a society full of goods,"" she says.

0,"Border control authorities across the country have been told to ensure enough officers are on duty to deal with the travel rush during the upcoming Spring Festival holiday and further increase efficiency to handle surging numbers of travelers. Chinese ports are expected to receive an average of 1.77 million visits from travelers exiting and entering the country every day during the holiday, up by 8.9 percent from last year's holiday, the National Immigration Administration said on Friday. The Spring Festival holiday is from Monday to Feb 10 this year. Border control authorities should open additional inspection queues during peak times to ensure Chinese travelers can pass through border controls within 30 minutes, including waiting time, the administration said. Efficiency in dealing with foreign travelers should be improved as well. Spring Festival is a traditional time for Chinese people to return home for family reunions. Many people also make overseas trips for sightseeing during the seven-day holiday. Airbnb's latest outlook for the Lunar New Year shows that travelers from the Chinese mainland are expected to visit 1,048 cities in 111 countries and regions during this year's festival. The online travel agency Ctrip estimated that about 7 million Chinese will head overseas this year to more than 90 countries and regions. The most popular destination is Thailand, followed by Japan and Indonesia. Peak passenger flows out of the country through major airports such as those in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Chengdu are forecast to fall on Monday and Wednesday, and the peak flow entering the country may occur on Feb 9 and 10, according to the National Immigration Administration. Border authorities at the land ports connecting the Chinese mainland with Hong Kong and Macao are preparing for a travel rush from Thursday to Feb 9. Beijing border control authorities decided to temporarily divert travelers landing at Beijing Capital International Airport by guiding them to the east or west side of the arrival hall during the Spring Festival travel rush, Xinhua News Agency reported. Beijing border authorities have also installed more facial recognition cameras with better lighting systems and placed fingerprint registration devices in a more convenient location at self-service kiosks so people can pass inspections faster. Travelers are expected to go through border controls in Beijing 1 million times between Jan 29 and Feb 10. Beijing border control authorities will publish daily forecasts of exit and entry volumes through traditional and social media outlets. Luohu, a major port in Shenzhen for travel to and from Hong Kong, is expected to see an average of 273,000 visits during the Spring Festival holiday on a daily basis, according to the administration."
1,"For Yin Mingshan life turned full circle when Lifan Industry (Group), a homegrown motorcycle maker, become one of the nation's largest non-State-owned automakers and a beacon of China's success through reform and opening-up. Little did the 80-year old chairman anticipate that the blazing trail he charted for Lifan in Chongqing would serve as a blueprint for the success of private enterprises and entrepreneurship, especially in a country where giant State-owned enterprises ruled the roost. The former book editor turned entrepreneur was last month named in the list of top 100 outstanding private entrepreneurs of the past four decades in China, a ranking released in Beijing by the United Front Work Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. As the founder of Lifan, one of China's largest car and motorcycle makers, his success story started soon after China embarked on reform and opening up in 1978. ""Lifan has grown from being a small street vendor in 1992 into a public company,"" said Mou Gang, who became the chairman of Lifan after Yin stepped down last October. ""The 26 years of our development is representative of China's reform and opening-up,"" he said. Automobile manufacturing is one of the pillar industries in Chongqing, an industrial city in southwestern China. After Guangdong province, the city is the second-largest car manufacturing base in China with a throughput of 3 million cars in 2017, accounting for 10.3 percent of the nation's total auto production. In the past four decades, Yin and his company have kept pace with the changes in China's socioeconomic development and made many achievements in the private sector. ""Lifan's development is largely based on innovation, exports and credibility,"" Mou said. By the end of 2017, Lifan had 15,000 employees and 23 plants, including seven in countries such as Russia, Vietnam, Ethiopia and Uruguay. Its products have been sold in 140 countries and regions. True to its commitment, Lifan invests more than 6 percent of its revenue in R&D annually. It has two national level research centers for cars and has motorcycles and applied for over 10,000 patents in 35 countries and the European Union. It has already been granted 9,530 patents, according to company officials. In addition, it has been the leading Chinese carmaker in Russia for seven years in a row. Yin founded Lifan at the age of 54 in 1992 with only nine employees. The company first only made motorcycles, and became the leader in the sector after achieving exports of over $100 million in 2001. Though he was happy with this achievement, Yin soon realized that Chinese consumers may need more cars than motorcycles as living standards were improving steadily. In 2003, Lifan began to focus on vehicles and built its first car plant. In 2006, it produced its first car, the Lifan 520, a successful model in the market. In 2010, Lifan went public and listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, the first Chinese private carmaker to do so. Despite the stiff competition at home and abroad, Lifan is speeding up its transformation and industrial upgrading, and is ready to achieve breakthroughs in new energy and smart cars. In 2010, Lifan worked with the electric car research center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences to produce new energy cars and its first model, the Lifan 620, was used as a security vehicle at the 2010 Shanghai World Expo. To establish an industrial chain for smart cars, Lifan invested in a car-hailing platform for new-energy vehicles, Pand Auto, in 2015. The company hopes to have 300,000 electric cars in its rental business by 2020, which will help make it one of the leading new-energy vehicle leasing platforms in China, according to Gao Yu, CEO of Pand Auto. In the coming years, Lifan will narrow focus to concentrate on vehicle production and further expansion in overseas markets. ""With our ample manufacturing experience and research capability, we will still focus on automobile manufacturing,"" said Ma Ke, who became Lifan's president last year at the age of 33. He added that Lifan will continue to make traditional diesel and petrol cars, new energy cars and hybrid electrical vehicles."
0,"Wang Xin is a landscape designer by profession and a farmer in practice. His customers believe the strawberries he grows on his organic plantation in the southern outskirts of Beijing are ""the best in China"". Every day, when men and women of similar age are stuck in heavy traffic and endless meetings, the 33-year-old revels in his rural life, far from the downtown crowds. He rises with the sun and works all day in the fields or visits the farmers' market to sell his fresh produce. At the end of the day, he goes to bed with sore muscles and falls into a deep sleep. He does not take time to consider whether the work is hard, preferring to get on with the job. ""It has become my lifestyle. This is the life I chose to live,"" he said. In a country where food is so central to the national culture, many well-educated urbanites like Wang are returning to the countryside and dedicating themselves to growing fresher, healthier food. Every Tuesday, Saturday and Sunday, Wang brings freshly-picked strawberries to the organic farmers' market in Beijing. They are grown naturally in nutrient-rich soil, without the use of fertilizers, pesticides, growth hormones or chemicals. ""I don't plan on becoming filthy rich, or I wouldn't have gone for organic farming,"" Wang said. With his firm, athletic build and healthy tan, it is hard to picture him as the designer who used to spend days and nights in front of a computer screen. Having majored in landscape botany, Wang has always been a plant lover. When he was 25, he realized his sedentary lifestyle was making him gain weight, and he could no longer stand being an office drone. He quit his job, rented two plantation sheds in the suburbs and started his farming career from scratch. Last month, Wang presented this winter's first fruit from a batch he planted in September. However, the work really began in July, when he prepared all-natural organic matter to enrich the soil. The formula has been perfected through years of research in collaboration with Beijing University of Agriculture, where he studied, to simulate the formation of the fertile dark forest soil of Northeast China, known for its high crop yields. Logically, the true foundation of organic farming lies in soil content: if the soil is right - as a living organism with a complex organic structure - the outcome is safe, and tasty food can be grown without the need for fertilizing chemicals, according to Wang. But quality produce is not his only objective. He hopes to build a cultivation model that rejuvenates the soil itself, because regular planting and overexploitation can lead to soil degradation within a matter of years. Wang's life on the farm has not always been a smooth ride, but after a rough start he believes he has learned valuable lessons. He has gone back to his old university and visited colleagues in Tochigi prefecture, Japan, to study the most modern organic farming techniques. ""For organic farming to become truly sustainable, revitalization of the soil is key. I am certain that in three to four years, the soil I have been reviving will keep getting healthier and healthier,"" he said.,Wang is not the only person working hard to master soil rejuvenation. In Alshaa League, a semi-arid region in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region in North China, Ma Yanwei has spent years reinvigorating saline soil by applying water-saving methods to cultivate fruit and crops suitable for local conditions. Sweet melons are the best-selling produce from Ma's farm. Their sweet taste is the result of many years of study, experimentation and hard work in the desert. Ma aims to find an ideal organic farming method to maximize the use of the scarce water resources and repair the soil. ""As long as the soil improves, it is natural to harvest healthy produce,"" he said. In the past six years, he has seen a growing number of young people returning to the countryside to take up farming. In 2017, he established a network that allows new farmers to communicate, exchange experiences and help each other. ""It means we will be able to avoid longer detours and the mistakes made by others,"" he said.,For 18 years, Zhang Zhimin, who used to work as a foreign trade expert, has been building an idyllic farm in the southwestern suburbs of Beijing to produce food crops and preserve biodiversity. As a speaker of several languages, Zhang was sent to work in the food import-export sector when China opened its market to the outside world. She believes that ""agriculture is the art of man and nature working together"". On her biofarm, called Heaven's Blessings, nature rules man. Instead of eliminating weeds and pests, the wholesome biosphere works autonomously to produce seasonal harvests. ""Agriculture is the management of life, and life should be nourished by life itself,"" Zhang said. At Heaven's Blessings, trees, bushes, grasses, insects, birds and cattle coexist harmoniously. The place is more like a habitat than a farm. In early summer, Zhang chops tender leaves and weeds that grow in the shade of the peach trees to feed her cattle and make room for grass-based crops to thrive. In early autumn, she lets the cows roam free to finish the weeding process.,In Wang's vegetable shed, the natural ecosystem ensures the harvest is healthy and no outside intervention is necessary. ""I have observed that the grass that coexists with the crops functions as a regulatory factor for the microclimate by keeping the soil moist,"" he said. Also, a native species of spider that weaves webs among the vegetables feeds on minuscule whiteflies that are usually hard to detect, thus preventing the need for harmful insecticides. Having learned about the latest farming models in Japan, Germany and Israel, Wang has also turned to ancient Chinese agricultural traditions to find inspiration to better coordinate human activities with nature. At a Farmers' Assembly at China Agricultural University last month, Meng Fanqiao, a professor at the university's College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, said organic/ecological farming is an important measure to improve the quality and safety of agricultural produce. ""Organic/ecological farming is of vital significance for economic development as well as environmental protection in rural areas. It should play a leading role in China's rural revitalization and the building of an 'ecological civilization',"" Meng said. Ma Xiaochao, a project officer with Know Your Food, a community group that focuses on food sustainability, said, ""We hope to promote healthy eating as a mainstream choice, along with organic ways of producing healthy foods."" Jin Shuqin, from the Research Center for the Rural Economy at the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, said: ""The green development of the countryside is a strategy that goes hand-in-hand with food security and higher incomes. Revitalizing the environment is a crucial aspect of overall rural rejuvenation."""
0,"A student of Beijing's first and only middle school for children from migrant families recently secured admission at Harvard University, one of the world's most elite institutions. Duan Mengyu was accepted by the Ivy League school for its master's program in education policy, according to Beijing News. After spending three years at Dandelion School in the capital's Daxing district for lower secondary education, Duan enrolled at United World Colleges in the United Kingdom as an undergraduate in 2012. Established in 2005, the Dandelion School is a private nonprofit school dedicated to helping the offspring of migrant workers in Beijing. The president of the school, Zheng Hong, is a Harvard alumnus with a master's degree in public administration. According to a recent survey conducted by The Harvard Crimson, the school's newspaper, 46 percent of its newly admitted students come from families whose annual income exceeded $500, 000. Nearly 30 percent of the students' families have at least one member who is an alumnus, the survey showed."
1,"China will use fiscal policy to optimize economic structures this year, Minister of Finance Liu Kun said on Sunday at the China Development Forum 2019 in Beijing. ""While the proactive fiscal policy will moderately expand domestic demand, it will stick to the main task of supply-side structural reforms,"" Liu said. He said the world's second-largest economy is now tackling difficulties in optimizing economic structures to achieve high-quality growth, a process in which fiscal policies play an important role. On one hand, the country will use taxation and other fiscal policies to facilitate the clearing-up of overcapacity in more industries and the displacement of market entities of low competitiveness with vigorous ones, Liu said. On the other hand, he said, government investment in basic research and public scientific activities will continue to increase, which could direct social capital and resources into strategic key areas. The central government's budget for science and technology is set at 354.3 billion yuan ($52.8 billion) this year, up 13.4 percent year-on-year, according to the ministry. The authorities will also continue to expand infrastructure investment and optimize its structure, aiming to boost the supply of services, such as education and medical care, as well as to support the new energy vehicle industry. Michael Spence, a professor at New York University and the winner of the 2001 Nobel Prize in economics, said at the forum that the Chinese government's investments have supplemented the deficiency in private sector investments. Spence said government investments will only be sustainable and reasonable when a country adopts the right policies to ensure economic growth. Apart from facilitating supply-side structural reforms, Liu pledged this year's plan would ""notably reduce"" the tax burden on manufacturers. China has announced a plan to reduce tax and fee burdens on enterprises by nearly 2 trillion yuan this year. According to Liu, tax cuts will represent about 70 percent of the total cut, while the rest will come from reductions in social insurance contributions and administrative fees. ""The focus will be reducing the tax burden on the manufacturing sector and micro and small enterprises,"" he said. Manufacturers will see a notable decrease in their taxes, as the value-added tax cuts, which take effect on April 1, will reduce the VAT rate of manufacturing and other industries by 3 percentage points to 13 percent. Moreover, tax reduction and exemption policies for micro and small enterprises took effect on Jan 1, benefiting more than 95 percent of all corporate taxpayers in China, Liu said. ""For the next step, we will roll out policies as soon as possible to ensure the tax and fee cuts will be put into place, and make market entities - especially small and micro enterprises - really feel the benefits,"" he said. As the tax and fee cut plan and downside pressure entail slower fiscal revenue growth this year, the country does face challenges of maintaining the balance between spending and revenue, Liu said. However, he said that local governments raising debts in ""hidden ways"" - which typically involves violations of laws or rules - will be strictly forbidden to contain risks."
0,"With the rising number of Chinese students pursuing education abroad, an upcoming television series aims to reflect their struggles in unfamiliar lands. co-penned by veteran writers Gao Xuan and Ren Baoru, fictionalizes a coming-of-age story of several Chinese youngsters who graduate from prestigious Ivy League colleges but see their friendship face serious challenges in society. As early as 2000, the scriptwriter duo toured to the United States to interview a number of Chinese students. Their real-life stories of problems caused by language barriers and cultural clashes have inspired the script. ""We believe the best television sequences are rooted from real-life stories, so we wished to know how the Chinese students study and live in foreign countries,"" Gao said in a recent interview with Chinese reporters. Director Liu Jiang, famous for popular TV dramas like  (2010) and  (2013), revealed the series was shot in the United States, Cambodia and several Chinese cities, such as Tianjin, Beijing and Shijiazhuang in Hebei province. ""The filming in New York and Las Vegas took around two months. It cost a lot but it's worth it. Audiences will see the campuses of some of the world's top colleges in the series,"" he said. But the 49-year-old director says it's more than a production about Chinese students who study abroad. ""We hope to reflect young elites' sense of duty and their values in modern China,"" he said. The 50-episode series is set to air on Beijing Satellite TV and the Shanghai-based Dragon TV, as well as two video streaming sites Youku and iQiyi in May, but the premiere date has yet to be decided. Led by Tang Yan and Luo Jin, two A-list television stars, the cast also includes veterans Wang Zhiwen and Zhang Kaili."
0,"In badminton, you're supposed to keep an eye on the shuttlecock, but not too closely. You shouldn't let that speedy little devil pop you in the eye. It's a real danger, according to research published recently in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. Badminton is popular in China and Southeast Asia because of its accessibility and apparent low risk. But it may just be that you don't see the risks coming. A research team, led by Yu Jie and Liu Yi, both veteran doctor in Beijing Tongren Hospital's ophthalmology department, found that about 70 percent of eye trauma in badminton is caused by the high-speed shuttlecock, with 30 percent from being hit by a partner's racquet. A hard, direct strike can result in ocular injuries such as hyphaema, pupil dilation, traumatic cataract and lens dislocation. In rare cases, severe retinal detachment can occur, it said. The vast majority of eye injuries involve doubles players — most frequently players turning around just in time to be hit by their partner. It's considered an improper move, but it's common among amateurs, according to Yu Jie, associate senior doctor in Department of Ophthalmology of Beijing Tongren Hospital. In addition, players in the forecourt risk being struck by their opponents. ""Many players don't know that playing badminton can hurt their eyes, therefore they have little awareness of self-protection. In fact, badminton has been classified as a high-risk sport for ocular injury due to the small, dense shuttlecock that can travel at the highest speed among all ball-related sport,"" she explained. A lack of professional guidance and failure to wear eye protective gear are the main factors leading to eye injuries, she recognized, citing research findings. The survey of 85 patients found that about 70 percent of the injured and 82 percent of the instigators had not received badminton lessons from a professional. Although 50 percent respondents said they knew of the high risk of an eye injury in badminton, none of them had taken any steps to protect themselves. Based on the research, Yu advised badminton players to wear special protective eyewear, especially forecourt players in doubles. Safety education and professional coaching are also necessary for beginners to prevent serious eye injuries, she said. Yu suggested extra precautions or avoiding badminton altogether for those with severely impaired vision or only one functioning eye. The research is regarded by experts as a meaningful step in China's initiative to integrate sports and medicine. The initiative aims to join domestic mainstream sports and medical resources to promote public health through cooperation in the healthcare and sports sectors."
0,"Every worker or dream chaser coming to Beijing has their own reasons. No one here lives blindly, said Chang Hailong, a 34-year-old food deliveryman from Songyuan, a city in the northeastern province of Jilin. Having only been in Beijing for a month, Chang is still curious about everything in the capital. ""I had the idea of starting a business in Beijing about 15 years ago, when I graduated from senior high school in my hometown,"" he said, with a wry smile. ""But I was held back by my father, who wanted me to take his position at the Daqing Oilfield because it was a job for life."" When he was 19, Chang inherited his father's job, taking responsibility for mapping and measuring the oilfield. ""Actually, I didn't like the job, but I agreed to my father's request,"" he said. Two years later, he started work as a forklift truck driver at a chemical factory in Jilin. ""Life was boring in the factory. I worked from 9 am to 2 pm, but most of the time I had nothing to do because the forklift trucks were only occasionally used to carry products,"" he said. ""I got quite good pay there; enough to provide for my wife and 7-year-old son."" Last month, Chang quit his comfortable life and traveled to Beijing to find a job. ""For me, it's a new start,"" he said. ""I was afraid before I came to Beijing, because I'm 34 years old this year and I could not have borne the blame from my family if I'd failed to find a job. However, it's my choice; Beijing has been my dream city since I was in senior high school."" New to the food delivery market, Chang has performed poorly, compared with his peers. ""I was fined about 200 yuan ($30) because of late deliveries. I'm still not familiar with the community I'm responsible for, so I have to waste time asking for directions to restaurants and customers."" Chang said he works from 7 am to 10 pm, and he dare not take a nap at noon in case an order arrives. Also, he skimps to keep his food expenditure below 20 yuan a day. Although he earned 7,000 yuan in his first month at work, he paid 1,500 yuan for rent. ""I'm okay with the life, but I want to give a better life to my wife and little son,"" he said. ""The financial pressure will spur me to work harder and become the delivery champion of my station."" He said he has become more emotional since he started doing the job. ""Every 'thank you' from a customer is like applause for my work. It's different from my previous job as I get more human contact and meet different people every day."" Though he is satisfied with his new life, he is still concerned about injury insurance and work safety. ""We have no official employment contracts. As for insurance, the company takes 100 yuan from me every month. They say it is for insurance, but I have no idea what insurance they are talking about. Also, it's unavoidable that I have to run red lights, as I have to rush to deliver food in just 38 minutes (the company's guaranteed maximum delivery time). I hope the time can be extended someday,"" he said. In the near future, Chang plans to open a restaurant in his hometown, and he hopes that his job as a food deliveryman will help him gain a better knowledge of people's favorite tastes."
0,"An accusation that Master Xuecheng, abbot of the Beijing-based Longquan Temple and former head of the Buddhist Association of China, sent female monks obscene messages is true, China's top religious affairs regulator said on Thursday. Verification came after an accusation against Xuecheng in early August in a 95-page report of various violations, including sexual harassment of several nuns, illegally expanding the scale of the temple and embezzling donations from believers. Investigations found Xuecheng is suspected of violating Buddhist precepts by sending female monks obscene messages, and will receive punishment according to the constitution of the Buddhist Association of China, the State Administration for Religious Affairs said in a statement. The allegedly illegal construction of the temple was found to have no construction license, and the use of a large amount of temple funds was found to be in violation of financial management regulations. Related departments are investigating the problems, it said. The reported sexual harassment is still under investigation by Beijing public security, according to the statement."

Beijing took the second place, followed by Zhejiang province, Tianjin and Jiangsu province on the list of places with highestper capita disposable personal income in the first six months. Shanghai and Beijing are the only two places in the country with per capita disposable personal income surpassing 30,000 yuan in January-June period,with the former recording 32,612 yuan ($4,777.64 ) and the latter 31,079 yuan. In the same period, China's average per capita disposable income grew 6.6 percent year-on-year in real terms to 14,063 yuan, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). The growth was calculated after taking into consideration the effects of inflation and the nominal growth in resident income was 8.7 percent in the first six months, NBS data showed. The disposable income of nine provinces and places has surpassed the average level of the country and the growth rate of disposable income in many places is higher than the growth rate of GDP."
1,"Edinburgh-based Pickering’s Gin is tapping into China’s thirst for British products by opening a bar dedicated to gin in Beijing. The gin and seafood bar will open in the Chaoyang district next month at a location close to the British embassy where customers will be able to taste Pickering’s gins along with Scottish seafood. The company said it will be the first gin bar in China’s capital. The move comes after months of work and planning along with Chinese craft beer brewer, Panda Brew and is part of the Edinburgh distillery’s long-term export strategy to open Pickering’s gin and seafood bars in major cities across China. Marcus Pickering, co-founder and head of export at the company, sees the bar as a stepping stone for both Pickering’s gin and Scottish produce in China. “Our water is world famous – whether it is the fish that swim in it, the alcohol we distil with it, or the ice we make from it, our bar is a celebration of the best to come from Scotland’s exceptional waters,” he said. “From gin to salmon, whisky to beer – we’ll be flying the flag for quality Scottish produce in China.” Gin is one of the fastest-growing spirits in the United Kingdom in terms of popularity. There are now 315 distilleries, up from 152 in 2013, according to figures from HM Revenue & Customs. With China’s growing middle class already getting a taste for craft beer and Scottish whisky, the company hopes gin will be the next big thing in the world’s second-largest economy. “Gin is a very new category for the Chinese mainland but it is generating much excitement, particularly from the younger generation. There’s a desire in China for lighter, fresher drinks, and gin’s versatility really taps into this,” said Kurt Xia, director of Panda Brew. Xia added that Chinese consumers will be attracted to products from Scotland because of the nation’s “unique history, natural environment, provenance, and the quality of the produce”. The likes of Scottish craft beer makers BrewDog and Innis & Gunn are already capitalizing on the fast-growing market for premium alcoholic drinks. Earlier this year, BrewDog announced it planned to open a brewery in China, its second-largest international market. And Panda Brew opened a Scottish whisky bar in central Beijing in 2017. The announcement from Pickering’s Gin closely follows the launch of direct Hainan Airlines flights between Beijing and Edinburgh, and an initiative in Edinburgh to ensure local businesses offer Chinese visitors a warm welcome."
0,"Beijing will continue to improve the quality and incomes of rural schoolteachers to provide equal education opportunities to students in both urban and rural areas. The capital will offer incentives to encourage rural teachers to stay and work in the countryside, Li Yi, spokesperson of the Beijing Municipal Education Commission, said at a news conference on Wednesday. Since 2016, the municipal government has been encouraging normal schools to increase enrollment of students majoring in teaching. Meanwhile, the government will give 40,000 yuan ($6,100) to each rural teacher who graduates from a normal school or comprehensive college with a non-teaching major and who has been working in a rural area for five successive years. In addition, each rural teacher will receive a monthly travel allowance of between 1,400 yuan and 4,000 yuan, depending on the distance of their work location from the center city. By Nov 6, 17,489 rural teachers in 383 schools had received the allowance. Li said the government is discussing the provision of low-cost rental housing for rural teachers. Beijing has also allocated 20 percent more financial support to the training of rural teachers compared with urban schoolteachers. Rural teachers who go to urban schools for teaching training practice will receive 530 yuan per person each time. Cui Haiming, a physical education teacher in Huairou district in Beijing, has been working in rural schools for 28 years. In 2013, he started working in a primary school in a remote mountain area as a volunteer, he said during the news conference. When the voluntary period came to end he decided to stay. “My salary was 5,000 yuan a month in 2014. As the subsidies policy has been implemented, I now get about 10,000 yuan a month, which has improved my living conditions,” Cui said. He said he will stay in the rural school for the rest of his working life until retirement."
0,"The region to the north of Beijing's Fifth Ring Road is dominated by Tiantongyuan, an enormous neighborhood reputed to be the largest residential area in Asia that houses approximately 700,000 people. The area, which is home to more than 3 percent of the city's population, mainly migrant workers, is nicknamed ""Sleeper Town"" because a lack of amenities and entertainment facilities mean most of the residents only go there to rest. Located at the end of subway line 5, a major route connecting the downtown to the northern suburbs, Tiantongyuan attracted its huge population as a result of its low property prices and relatively convenient location. However, its dilapidated condition is a major headache for the city and the area faces a host of problems, including a lack of infrastructure, both social and industrial, allied to heavy traffic congestion. Priced at 2,650 yuan per square meter in 1999, Tiantongyuan was built to provide affordable housing. Nearly 20 years later, property prices in the community have risen more than fourteenfold to 38,000 yuan ($5,600) per sq m. Covering 480,000 sq m, Tiantongyuan includes five major communities with 18 subdistricts that were built in 2000. In the first three years of the century, the population quickly rose to more than 100,000. The family of Beijing native Du Bo moved to Tiantongyuan in 2005 because at 5,600 yuan per sq m the area was still relatively cheap. ""Our old home in Haidian district was scheduled for urgent demolition, so we had to find another place to live,"" the 26-year-old said. Though the family would have preferred an apartment in the downtown, Du's parents could not afford to move to such an expensive area. The urgency of the situation meant the family of four, which included his grandfather, had no alternative but to move to the 120-sq-m, three-bedroom apartment in Tiantongyuan. ""Dirty"" and ""chaotic"" were Du's first impressions of the neighborhood. Unlicensed traders blocked the roads, meaning people could not park their cars, and feral cats and dogs often appeared on the streets. As a result, some people simply bought apartments to rent to tenants. Du said he has heard that in a building near his tower block, one bedroom can accommodate eight people. ""It's like a dormitory at college,"" he said.,Despite the deterioration in conditions, the abundance of apartments and relatively low prices continue to attract young and first-time buyers, as well as tenants. Speaking in a range of accents, a substantial number of residents squeeze into buses and the subway every morning and head to work. Chen Mo is one of them. After studying in the capital for seven years, he chose to settle in the city after graduation. In 2001, he took a job with State Grid Corp, the national electricity generator. Initially, Chen rented an apartment in Huilongguan, a crowded community in Changping district, 10 kilometers west of Tiantongyuan's center, that was well-known for its affordable property. Served by subway line 13, Changping's relative ease of access to public transportation attracted Chen, so he decided to buy an apartment there in 2010. After months of research, he discovered that he could buy an apartment of more than 100 sq m in Huilongguan for 30,000 yuan per sq m, which would only be enough for a home of 50 to 60 sq m in other parts of the city. ""Property prices doubled in Huilongguan in just six months, so I made the down payment in 2011 without any hesitation,"" he said. Many others followed suit, so a dense population and heavy traffic congestion quickly became the community's default setting. However, without any industry to provide jobs and with few high-quality schools, many people chose to leave once they had made enough money. Chen and Du are now also considering leaving. Chen was single when he bought his apartment, but since marrying and starting a family, the 38-year-old has moved twice within the community. To avoid the morning rush hour, Chen has to get up before 6 am every day and catch the subway to Xicheng district, in the west of the city, before 7 am. His wife, Zhu Zhu, who also works in Xicheng but drives to her job, has to get up at 5 am to avoid traffic congestion. The 35-year-old said that when she was pregnant and underwent prenatal examinations, the drive to the hospital usually took an hour. ""However, if I encountered a traffic jam, I had to endure a three-hour round trip,"" she said. Regular access to medical services is still a problem. Though the community has six high-quality hospitals and 30 health clinics, Zhu said she doesn't trust the quality of service, so if her son falls ill she takes him to the downtown for treatment. Before buying his apartment, Chen didn't realize that Changping lacked high-quality schools. He is now considering renting an apartment in the downtown when his son, now 3, is old enough to attend primary school. Du has other considerations. Last year, the situation in Tiantongyuan became so bad that he decided to look for a new home in a different neighborhood. He is still looking. ""I am still searching for an affordable apartment,"" said the financial sector management trainee.,To eradicate the problems in the capital's suburb in August, the Beijing government launched a three-year, 20-billion-yuan action plan focusing on 97 projects. However, having since consulted with 17 commissions and bureaus, the aim is now to work on more than 100 projects. Cai Qi, Party secretary of Beijing, said the city's urban planners should look at ways of implementing Tiantongyuan's original functions to improve living standards and provide better, happier homes. The plan is part of a citywide campaign to build the capital into a world-class city in accordance with the Beijing Overall Urban Development Plan published in October 2017. It will run until 2030. Li Ding, associate professor at the School of Sociology and Population Studies at Renmin University of China, has studied Huilongguan for more than five years. He said the upgrade is badly needed, so the action plan should have been formulated earlier. Moreover, as the lack of major infrastructure is not an issue residents can tackle, the local government must assume the responsibility. ""Most Huilongguan residents are highly educated, so their demand for educational and cultural facilities is much higher,"" Li said. Since renovation work began at a 19-hectare sports and cultural park in Huilongguan, Li has noticed changes in the community. ""Some old sports facilities have been demolished and the park has been divided into four zones to provide a modern facility,"" he said. According to the Beijing Municipal Development and Reform Commission, there are plans to build six kindergartens as well as three primary and two secondary schools to satisfy residents' needs.,A younger generation of residents－80 percent of them tenants and many of them migrant workers－now occupies Tiantongyuan. At weekends, a number of community centers on one street in Huilongguan are filled with people. One of the most popular centers is a children's library called ""Happy Book Kid"", whose owner, Wang Yanping, has lived in the community for more than 10 years. As a migrant worker for more than 20 years, the 40-year-old said she always wanted a settled place of her own so she could get to know more people and gain a sense of belonging. She established the library at the end of 2013 with the aim of providing a range of books that children could read and study after school. At weekends, the library is packed as parents bring their children to participate in a range of activities, including drama performances, poetry recitals and handicraft classes. ""If just one kid becomes interested in reading, I will have made a contribution to their life,"" Wang said. ""A rising number of families treat the library as a place to gather, and they love being here."",Li, the professor, is a regular visitor, and he and his wife often bring their 3-year-old daughter to participate in the activities. He has also established a discussion group in Huilongguan in the hope of using people's input to build a better area. ""Everyone has an idea of the kind of life they want to live, and to live in a better community is everyone's dream,"" he said. In an interview with 21st Century Business Herald, Tian Zaiwei, CEO of Shuntiantong Co, the company overseeing Tiantongyuan's redevelopment, said the neighborhood covers the same area as many medium-sized cities overseas. That means there is still a long way to go, because construction and improvement of a city can often take decades or even 100 years. After 20 years, Tiantongyuan has slowly filled its developmental gaps, and despite the lack of infrastructure, the congestion and dense population, it remains an area that many people consider when looking to buy property."
1,"BEIJING - Beijing's GDP was estimated at more than 3 trillion yuan ($444 billion) last year, making it the second Chinese city crossing this threshold following Shanghai. Beijing mayor Chen Jining said Monday the city set its economic growth target at 6-6.5 percent for 2019, compared with last year's target of about 6.5 percent. ""Beijing is in a critical period of urban renewal and high-quality development,"" Chen said while delivering the annual government work report at the meeting of the annual session of the Beijing Municipal People's Congress. The Chinese capital is fostering new momentums for high-quality growth powered by non-capital functions removal, innovation, and further opening-up. The work of relieving Beijing of functions nonessential to its role as the capital has progressed remarkably in 2018, Chen said. A total of 656 manufacturing companies in the city were shut down, and more than 200 markets and logistics centers were relocated last year. In 2019, more than 300 manufacturing firms and 66 markets and logistics centers, usually high-polluting or low-end industries, will be phased out or moved to nearby regions. The removal of non-capital functions from Beijing is part of a greater strategy to integrate the development of Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei for a better economic structure, cleaner environment, and improved public services. Zhao Hong, deputy head of the Beijing Academy of Social Sciences, pointed out that innovation and high-tech sectors could power the high-quality growth. The number of national high-tech enterprises in Beijing reached 25,000 in 2018, up 25 percent year-on-year. On average, 199 innovative startups opened in the city every day, according to the government work report. In 2019, the city government will continue to expand global channels for attracting science and technology talent, encourage universities to beef up the building of innovation centers, and give support to young and innovative entrepreneurs. ""In addition, Beijing can create a more friendly-business environment to tap into the market potential and stimulate high-quality growth,"" Zhao said. Beijing will release new measures involving foreign exchange management reform, cross-border use of the yuan, and investment and financing facilitation in 2019. International financial institutions such as banks, insurers, securities, and fund firms, as well as professional service organizations covering the fields of accountancy, audits, assessments, and credit are welcome to set up regional headquarters or affiliated agencies in Beijing. Last year, Beijing's actual use of foreign capital surpassed $16 billion. Meanwhile, a total of 618 foreign talent have obtained permanent residency. To boost consumption in the night-time economy, Beijing will encourage malls, supermarkets, and convenient stores to extend their opening hours this year, the work report said. Beijing plans to slash its prospect for public budget revenue growth to 4 percent in 2019, down from about 6.5 percent last year. Chen said the capital will continue to cut taxes for small- and micro-enterprises as well as start-ups, in addition to about 18.8 billion yuan of tax cuts in 2018. Xu Zewei, chairman of 91 Technology Group and a deputy to the Beijing Municipal People's Congress, said compared with government subsidies, tax cuts can benefit more companies and save their operating costs. ""Companies can put the money saved into research and development or use it to tap into new markets,"" Xu said."

The forum was the third event of the Tengyun Cultural Forum, which is a campaign launched by Tencent Center for Social Research. The center is dedicated to the promotion of traditional culture, the integration of science and technology and humanities, and stimulation of the cultural creativity among young people in the digital age. Tencent, which is an Internet-based enterprise, strives to promote the integration of science and technology and culture, and to promote the inheritance and innovation of traditional culture with technology, the company says. One of the guests, Ye Shuxian, a scholar of mythology and a professor from Shanghai Jiaotong University, said: ""The origin of a civilization is not based on rationality, science or philosophy, but the belief supported by specific mythological concepts."" The event is also a prelude to the upcoming UP2019 Tencent Conference of New Cultural and Creative Industry, which aims to explore the power of cultural and creative works and excellent IPs as well as their positive impact on the society."
0,"BEIJING - Beijing issued a yellow alert for air pollution Tuesday. Yellow alert means the average daily air quality index (AQI) in the city will exceed 200 for at least two days. Beijing will see its air moderately or seriously polluted from Tuesday night. Cold air and rain on Friday are expected to improve the air quality, according to Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau. China National Environmental Monitoring Center said that the central and southern areas of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei would be affected. Response measures including dust control in construction sites, suspension of construction work and heavy vehicle restrictions will be taken from Wednesday. Under China's four-tier warning system, red is the most severe, followed by orange, yellow and blue."
0,"Every day, Li Yunting collates data related to pollutant levels and the weather forecasts, and issues a prediction about air quality for use by decision makers and the general populace.  ""From the monitoring records, the efforts against air pollution work, especially those in the first eight months, have made me confident about further improvement,"" said Li, who has worked at the Beijing Environmental Monitoring Center for 18 years.  In the first eight months of this year, the average concentration of PM2.5 - hazardous fine particulate matter - in the capital has been 35.5 percent lower than during the same period in 2013, according to data released by the center.  ""The records show that this dramatic decline is the result of measures, such as the closure of polluting plants and reduced coal consumption, along with better weather conditions which dispersed the pollutants,"" she said.  For the bureau's technicians, who collect and analyze the data and weather patterns, smog brings not only worry and concern, but also a heavier workload, because it often triggers emergency responses, such as the suspension of production that are based on their forecasts and analysis of the sources of pollution, she said.  The Beijing authorities began monitoring and researching air pollution more than 10 years ago, developing advanced technologies and forming a team of researchers with deep experience, with the aim of providing in-depth information and accurate forecasts for policymakers.  ""In the past five years, we have attracted more attention. That has resulted in more work and sometimes it is exhausting, but it's worth it when we see more blue skies and win greater acclaim from the public,"" Li said."
0,"BEIJING -- The number of electric buses in Beijing will increase from the current 1,000 to 10,000 by 2020 in an effort to improve the environment, said Beijing Public Transport Group on Wednesday. The proportion of buses purely powered by electricity among the total public transport vehicles will increase from the current 10 percent to 60 percent in three years, said Zhong Qianghua, deputy general manager of the group. Zhong said electric buses create lower emissions and less noise. Each of the vehicles can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 45 tonnes every year, and the vehicles are free from PM2.5 emissions. Recently, two bus routes in Beijing's Yanqing District started using 50 new electric buses. It takes only around 20 minutes to charge a bus, and a single charge can power a bus for 80 kilometers. The two routes can transport 3.45 million people every year, cutting carbon dioxide emissions by more than 1,600 tonnes. Currently the group operates about 1,020 bus routes in Beijing. By 2020, the group will be able to transport about 3.046 billion people per year."
0,"Increasing cultural exchanges across the Taiwan Straits demonstrate the vitality of Chinese culture, Huang Zhixian, president of the All-China Federation of Taiwan Compatriots, said on Tuesday. The hearts of people on both sides of the Straits continued to beat together during the years when contact was banned because they are culturally connected, he said at the opening of the two-day Forum of Chinese Culture that kicked off on Tuesday at Peking University in Beijing. Since the 1980s, communication has resumed and cultural exchanges have increased, he said. He added, however, that the efforts of people agitating for Taiwan independence have intensified in the cultural field. But such political means cannot stand in the way of cross-Straits exchanges, he said at the forum, which was attended by about 300 scholars from both sides of the Straits. In August, the island authority passed a draft on history education that requires, starting next year, that the history curriculum for senior high school students will be divided into three regions - Taiwan, East Asia and the world - abandoning the three current categories: Taiwan, the Chinese mainland and the world. The new proposal suggests that mainland history is ""foreign"", while the history of the island is the history of ""the country"", said Chi Kuang-yu, professor of politics at National Taiwan Normal University of Taiwan. The China content has also been greatly reduced and will no longer be told chronologically by dynastic periods but rather in thematic units, according to the draft. That kind of change ""will poison the minds of the young generation on the island and is intended to make the young people forget their origins, the connection to the mainland"", he said. Zhu Songling, a professor specializing in Taiwan studies at Beijing Union University, said even if the island authority downgrades the Chinese mainland in history education, it cannot change the fact that both sides belong to the Chinese nation. He said the new approach might mislead young people, creating conflicts between what they learn in textbooks and what they see in practice as cross-Straits exchanges deepen."

0,"Although the British snooker champion has had three months off since winning his third World Championship title in May, Selby appears to have maintained his good form, staying on target in a challenge game during a fan-engaging event at a north Beijing club on Friday. Know as a patient, tough competitor, Selby solved all the complex obstacles set up by fans. He even navigated water bottles to pot target balls smoothly, entertaining his fans in the packed billiard hall. The event was organized by World Snooker's sponsor Kunlunshan, a Chinese natural mineral water brand, to promote the cue sport in China by bringing the British start to interact with fans. Selby, one of the world's most decorated snooker players, recently won an online vote launched by Kunlunshan in April, to become the Fans' Player of the Year thanks to strong support from Chinese fans. ""I have visited China many times but this time I came during the off season so I will have more time with the fans and promote the game here, which I feel really excited about,"" Selby said on Friday. Selby will continue his China trip and meet more amateurs selected from the Chinese Folk Billiards Championship, a nationwide grassroots tournament held in nine major cities including Beijing, Guangzhou and Chongqing involving about 25,000 amateurs. Thanks to the brilliant performances of Chinese stars such as Ding Junhui and Liang Wenbo, snooker has garnered an increasing number of fans in China and has shaken off its once niche status to become a popular leisure sport in the country. According to World Snooker, the sport's world governing body, China is scheduled to host four of the 19 ranking tournaments in the 2017-18 season, plus a series of high-profile invitational events.

0,"Areas in Beijing need to improve their electronic parking systems as a number of devices have been shown to be recording the wrong license plates, a Xinhua News Agency magazine reported on Tuesday. The report further said that an app used for parking services takes too long to verify for some users. Three districts in the capital since Jan 1 have rolled out electronic parking meters to improve order on the city's roads. More than 13,000 electronic parking meters have been installed along the roads in Beijing's Dongcheng, Xicheng and Tongzhou districts. A total of 7.97 million electronic car parking service tickets have already been issued for roadside parking tolls in the districts, according to Beijing Municipal Commission of Transport statistics. However, 0.3 percent of tickets have encountered problems. ""It's not a small amount and more than 20,000 car drivers might be affected,"" said Zhao Zhen, director of the static traffic management department of the city's transport commission. By the end of 2019, all roads in Beijing will apply electronic parking tolls through a mobile app. But some car owners said the app sometimes takes more than a week to verify and that the app's design is not user-friendly. Wang Jiong, deputy director of the Beijing Parking Management Center, said the institute had added manpower to investigate and solve bugs in the app. Xicheng district in the capital will also put 30 new monitoring devices into use by the end of June to strengthen the supervision of its electronic parking system, according to Gao Jun, deputy director of the Xicheng traffic police detachment."
0,"For many years, Huang Sizhou, a lawyer in Shenzhen, in the southern province of Guangdong, frequently traveled to Beijing in the north of the country to attend appeal hearings at the Supreme People's Court (the country's top legal chamber). Sometimes, he spent days away from his family.  Now, Huang's traveling days are over. ""The Supreme People's Court has established a circuit court in Guangdong, which means I can help clients resolve disputes and have face-to-face talks with judges from the top court without leaving my hometown,"" said Huang, who specializes in civil and commercial cases.  The first two circuit courts were opened in 2015 to enforce judicial reforms, improve efficiency and provide litigants with better legal services.  The First Circuit Court, in Shenzhen, is responsible for cases from the provinces of Guangdong and Hainan, and the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, while the Second Circuit Court, in Shenyang, capital of Liaoning province, oversees disputes in the northeastern provinces of Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang.  As branches of the country's top legal tribunal, the two courts are further reinforcing the rule of law, which has been promoted by the central leadership since 2014.  Statistics published in March show that in the past two years, the two branches shared 4,721 cases, 4,573 of which had been concluded. Before the circuit courts were established, those cases would have been added to the work of the Supreme People's Court in Beijing.  The success of the move resulted in four more circuit courts being established at the end of last year: in Zhengzhou, Henan province; Nanjing, Jiangsu province; Chongqing municipality; and Xi'an, Shaanxi province.  ""It means the top court's arms have extended across the country,"" said Xu Jiaxin, director of the Supreme People's Court's political department.  He added that the new courts aim to further narrow the gap between the top court and the public by helping to resolve disputes without people having to travel to Beijing: ""They are also the key to unifying standards for case hearings to ensure litigants receive considered, high-quality verdicts, and improving court efficiency.""  One of Huang's clients in Jiangxi province wanted his case to be heard at the circuit court in Shenzhen rather than Beijing, but that wasn't possible because his hometown is not within its jurisdiction.  Things changed on Dec 28. ""His dream came true because the Third Circuit Court was established in Nanjing to hear cases from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi and Shanghai,"" Huang said.  On the same day, the Fourth Circuit Court was established in Zhengzhou, Henan province, covering cases in the provinces of Henan, Shanxi, Hubei and Anhui. On Dec 29, the fifth and sixth branches were opened in Chongqing and Xian respectively to oversee cases in the country's southwestern and northwestern regions.  Meanwhile, the First Circuit Court will soon begin accepting cases from Hunan, and the Supreme People's Court is now responsible for hearing lawsuits from Beijing, Hebei province, Tianjin municipality and the Inner Mongolia autonomous region.  ""The situation that the top court's power diminishes in the country's distant corners has been alleviated, because the new branches mean people nationwide now have easy access to the top court to lodge appeals or report disputes,"" Xu said.  Now every region - central, northeast, northwest, southeast and southwest - has a circuit court. The four latest branches boast improved legal resources and the cities in which they are located are now regarded as regional centers, he added.  ""We stretched our arms out to the western regions because legal services are in great demand as now the country is promoting the Belt and Road Initiative,"" he said. ""Chongqing and Xi'an are relatively developed and have excellent legal facilities, so we selected them as branch locations.""  The Yangtze River Delta in East China is a good example of the new system. ""We've seen a boom in new types of cases. That required us to clarify the related judicial documents and provide unified verdicts in a timely manner, so we chose Nanjing, the closest major center, as the location for the circuit court,"" Xu added.  For central provinces, such as Henan, which have the largest populations and the highest number of appeals against judgments, ""the Fourth Circuit Court in Zhengzhou can satisfy the needs of litigants and nip conflict in the bud"", he said.  According to Huang, because judges from the top court visit litigants' home districts to resolve disputes, the legal process has become smoother. ""We can also provide legal opinions for the circuit court in person. In the past, it was difficult to meet judges from the highest chamber, let alone communicate with them, but now face-to-face talks are a reality.""  Since it was established, the circuit court in Shenzhen has regularly invited legal specialists, lawyers and law professors to visit and interact with local legal officials.  ""That happened at least three times last year. It allows the judges to analyze new judicial interpretations on our behalf and allows us to share questions which may arise while we handle disputes,"" Huang added.  Chen Yang, a lawyer who was involved in a case heard by the Third Circuit Court in January, has experienced the improved efficiency resulting from the dual-track system.  ""My client had a dispute about a contract. We were dismayed to discover that there would be a gap of 680 days between filing the case in Beijing and the first hearing,"" she said. ""However, when we decided to appeal to the top court, the third branch had just opened in Nanjing, and within two weeks, our case had been heard and the appeal was accepted.""  ""What's more, the second trial opened one month later,"" she added. ""If the circuit court hadn't existed, I would have had to spend at least two days in Beijing for the trial. This time, though, the trial only took about 20 minutes in Jiangsu.""  Huang said that before the new courts were established, litigants often complained about having to make repeated, time-consuming visits to Beijing to attend hearings at the Supreme People's Court. They were also unhappy about the length of time it took to reach verdicts. ""I believe the six branches will reduce the number of complaints and make people feel that justice can be dispensed more quickly,"" he said.  The heads of the four new circuit courts are vice-presidents of the top court, while 11 of the country's 36 chief judges hold doctorates in law, according to a statement from the Supreme People's Court.  Senior judges from the top court have been dispatched to the branches. ""However, we're also keen to recruit new staff at lower levels,"" said Xu, from the Supreme People's Court's political department.  Last month, the circuit courts in Nanjing and Zhengzhou advertised jobs on the top court's website, offering positions for clerks, legal officers for administrative affairs and as general staff in legal centers, providing the applicants pass the relevant exams.  ""All the judges dispatched by the top court will work in rotation to prevent judicial corruption, which may sometimes result from long-term stays at the branches,"" he added.  However, Shi Pengpeng, a law professor at the China University of Political Science and Law, said preventing official interference in hearings is not just a job for the courts: ""It will also require the combined efforts of a large number of departments, and a reliable supervision system.""   Since they were established two years ago, the courts had dealt with 4,721 cases, of which 4,573 had been concluded by Jan 31.  By March 31, the court had dealt with 484 cases. Judgments had been handed down in 180 cases.  By March 31, 434 cases, including 157 civil disputes and 18 criminal cases, had been filed at the court. A total of 211 had been concluded.  By March 31, the court had accepted nearly 300 cases, and received more than 7,000 visits from members of the public.  By March 31, the court had heard 315 cases, including 164 civil disputes and 147 administrative cases. It had also received 1,472 public visits and accepted 344 sets of case materials.

Dancers from Ballet Bacouloud' Haiti, a famed folk dance group in the Caribbean country, enthralled audience memberswith a show named  at the Tianqiao Performing Arts Center. Accompanied by powerful rhythms of drums and trumpets - the main instruments of Haitian music, the artists told stories of Haitian people's lives, the Haitian history, culture as well as tales and legends, with a repertoire of 14 programs. Ten Chinese violinists also played on stage, joining hands with Haitian musicians, adding a Chinese flavor into the show. ""They cooperated very well,"" said Zhao Haoran, a Chinese audience from a public relations company.

""Tonight's show was exactly like what people present in my hometown. I never expected to watch it here in Beijing,"" said the 25-year-old woman while swaying to music.,  Ralph Latortue, a representative from the Commercial Development Bureau of Haiti in China, said, ""It's a great chance of communication between Chinese and Haitians. We appreciate the opportunity to bring Haiti culture here, and we're also planning to invite Chinese artists to perform in Haiti in the future."" After Beijing, the dance troupe will tour in eastern Chinese cities of Dezhou and Jinan, both in Shandong province, from August 17 to 20.  is part of the 10th China International Youth Festival that started on August 13. In the upcoming three weeks, people in 12 Chinese cities, including Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, will be offered more than 200 performances by artists from 36 countries and regions, ranging from dances and chamber music to operas and musicals."
1,"Seeing the boom in the bike-sharing business, along with the resulting clutter created by randomly parked bikes, the Beijing municipal government has published a draft guideline for public comment, the top transport official said on Sunday. Zhou Zhengyu, director of the Beijing Municipal Commission of Transport, said that while the city will control the growing number of shared bikes from different companies, it will not impose a numerical cap. Instead, it will let each district government decide its own limit, taking public needs into consideration, as well as the development needs of the companies. ""People in Beijing have accepted the shared bikes well,"" he said. ""This green transportation method has motivated more people to start to ride."" Having seen the popularity of the bikes, the authority decided to suspend the expansion of government-backed public rental bikes. ""The shared bikes from private companies clearly have advantages compared with the public bikes, even though the frequency of public bike use hasn't been affected much by the shared bikes,"" Zhou said. Beijing has 86,000 public rental bikes, stationed mainly near subway stations and residential communities, commission figures show. Because the public bikes have immovable racks on which bikes must be locked, many prefer the shared bikes, which can be picked up and parked at the rider's convenience. At present, Beijing has 700,000 shared bikes from companies including ofo, Mobike and Bluegogo. There are about 11 million registered users, equivalent to nearly half of Beijing's population, the commission said. The rapid growth started in August, and has created a few issues, like overcapacity and traffic disorder. Some users leave bikes randomly without obeying the regulations. And some companies put huge numbers of bikes on the street to protect their market share. The Beijing guideline asks each district government to set a maximum number of shared bikes, then provide that to departments responsible for regulating the companies. It also requires companies to use technology to strengthen the management of illegal parking, in addition to ensuring the mechanical safety of the bikes by conducting regular tests. Users who park illegally several times would be blacklisted, and companies would be barred from providing service to anyone on the list. Lin Lei, 30, a regular user of the shared bikes, said he believes a better-regulated industry will raise the satisfaction level of users. ""In some places, shared bikes create a mess－piles of bikes－because people just throw them after use,"" he said. Yin Dafei, chief scientist in Mobike's big-data department, said the company has technology that can predict the parking patterns of shared bikes, which will help it to organize them and raise the company's operation efficiency."

Recorded in EMI's Abbey Road studio, it reached the top of the British album charts in May of that year and remained there for 30 weeks before being replaced by their second album, . It also started the journey of arguably the most legendary and revolutionary rock bands of all time, brought into being by its four members - Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr - in Liverpool in 1960. Fifty-five years later, from March 22, 2018, 28 famous Beatles albums including    and  have been made available on major Chinese streaming services, such as QQ Music, Kugou and Kuwo.,To mark the 55th anniversary of the release of the band's debut album, a Chinese documentary titled  has been launched on three online streaming music services under Tencent Music Entertainment Group-QQ Music, Kugou and Kuwo. With one episode being streamed online each week, the documentary, which has five episodes, has veteran Chinese singer-songwriters and music critics sharing their memories of the Beatles and discussing the bands enduring influence. An exhibition, titled is currently under way at the Today Art Museum in Beijing. Kicking off on March 24 and running until May 27, the exhibition displays posters, newspaper articles, album cover art, famous quotes, videos, audio clips and more than a hundred photos of the Beatles, from behind-the-scene shots to live shows, spanning from 1963 to 1972 and shot by photographers from Britain's The Mirror newspaper. ""The first time I read about the Beatles was in a youth magazine in the 1980s when I was a student at the Central Academy of Drama in Beijing,"" recalls renowned music critic Zhang Youdai in Beijing at the exhibition's opening ceremony. ""Their name was literally translated into Chinese as . The article said that the band influenced a whole generation of young people in the 1960s and I was curious about them and their music."",Then Zhang asked one of his classmates, a Japanese student, to buy him a cassette during a trip to Hong Kong at that time. Unfortunately, his classmate bought a cassette by a band from the Philippines covering Beatles' songs. ""When my Japanese classmate finally bought me the legal recording of the Beatles, I listened to their songs and realized why they influenced so many people,"" says Zhang. ""They invented a new sound for a rock band. I particular enjoyed their impeccable vocal harmonies."" As he grew up, Zhang became a big fan of the Beatles and bought the band's albums on his travels around the world. One of his favorite songs from the band is called which was written by Lennon and McCartney and was released as a single from their album   in 1969. ""I particularly like the lyrics: 'Boy, you're gonna carry that weight, Carry that weight a long time'. When I listened to that song in my 20s, I was overwhelmed then and I am overwhelmed even today,"" says Zhang. ""Undoubtedly, they are one of the greatest bands in the world and their legacy can still be felt today around the world."",Besides Chinese fans, the Beatles have also been a great inspiration for Chinese singer-songwriters. Beijing-based indie band,  traveled to London to record their new album, titled at Abbey Road Studios last year, as a tribute to the Beatles. They have collaborated with Scottish musician and producer Howard Bernstein, professionally known as Howie B, who has worked with artists like U2. The four members of the band also took a picture outside the studio, imitating the cover photo of the Beatles Abbey Road album, which is regarded as one of the most iconic images of pop history. ""There were lots of tourists taking photos on the road. Because of the Beatles, people make the pilgrimage to London to follow in their footsteps. We were deeply impressed,"" says Kong Yang, the band's lead vocalist. ""When we were working in the Abbey Road Studio, we felt close to not only the Beatles but also to George Martin, who produced many of the Beatles' classic albums,"" adds guitarist Huang Zijun. ""Producing an album is like doing experiment in a lab. It's the achievement of all four members of the Beatles and George Martin."" The band was founded by lead vocalist Kong and guitarist Huang when they were about 16 years old. In 2005, they moved from their hometown, Liuzhou, in South China's Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, to the capital to pursue their music dream. So far, they have released eight studio albums. ""We admire the Beatles' creative songwriting, which evolved along with their personal growth. It's amazing to think that 50 years later we are looking back on their music, which is still vibrant and pioneering,"" says Kong."
0,"Tenants in rented properties in Beijing can now send their children to schools in their own neighborhood as part of a recent effort by the authorities to improve education equality. Primary schools previously could only accept the children of local homeowners. But that regulation has been lifted to include renters who hold household registration－or hukou－in another part of the capital. The rule change is aimed at providing young couples more options in their children's education, according to Feng Hongrong, deputy director of Beijing's Education Commission. To be eligible, however, one parent must have had a stable job within the metropolitan district in which they rent, such as Haidian or Chaoyang, for more than three consecutive years. Chu Zhaohui, a senior researcher at the National Institute of Education, said the regulation is convenient for young Beijing residents with hukou, as it gives their children easier access to schools. However, he warned that the policy could put more pressure on Haidian and Xicheng districts, which have a lot of highly regarded primary schools. ""It could also see people rent homes in places with good schools to increase their options,"" he said. In addition to helping renters, the city government has said that quality primary schools that have some vacant seats will now accept pupils from nearby school districts through a computer-generated lottery operated by the education commission. It means there will be more choices, as some schools have good resources but the surrounding area has a shortage of students, Feng said. ""In a way, it guarantees fairness,"" he said. Chu, the researcher, said: ""The quality of each primary school will become more balanced if this is promoted over several years."" He said he has advised the education commission to apply the same lottery system to high-quality middle schools and high schools. China's law on compulsory education, introduced in 2006, states that governments should provide school-age students access to education in the place where they hold hukou. In 2014, Beijing issued regulations allowing pupils to enter primary schools near their homes, as a way to balance the development of primary and secondary schools and distribute education resources more fairly. The boundaries of Beijing's school districts are changed every year, which according to authorities is to prevent property prices around quality schools from overheating."

Three years and more than 40 revisions later, these songs will be performed during the upcoming Shi Jing Cai Wei musical at the Tianqiao Performing Arts Center in Beijing on Oct 20 and 21. The musical will feature both traditional Chinese musical instruments and Western string instruments. ""I have always been fascinated with Chinese poetry, especially the rhythm of the lines. They are like songs to me and I want to display the lines onstage musically,"" says Zou, who studied at the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing with renowned Chinese composer Ye Xiaogang. ""It's challenging to write a musical based on the poem which only has eight lines. Chinese poets express deeper meaning with simple words."" Zou, who has been teaching at the Central Conservatory of Music after obtaining his master's degree in 2001, had help from songwriter Liang Mang, who wrote lyrics for his songs in the musical. Chinese singers Li Weipeng and Jiang Qianru play the leading roles in the musical. The two musicians graduated from the musical performance department of Shanghai Conservatory of Music and have performed in a number of Chinese musicals, including Music Up and The Moon and Sixpence. According to the musical's producer Dai Xiaolan, Classic of Poetry showcases traditional Chinese culture from every aspect, such as farming, marriage and old customs."
1,"As the sharing economy in China thrives and gives rise to a wide range of new businesses, competition in the domestic market is getting fiercer, especially in the bike-sharing sector. Bluegogo International Inc, which used to rank as one of the top three Chinese bike-sharing companies, has gone bankrupt and reportedly owes nearly 200 million yuan ($30 million) to bicycle makers. On Nov 16, Bluegogo founder Li Gang admitted in a post on social networking platform WeChat that the company has faced severe operation problems. In October, China's first listed bike-sharing firm, Changzhou Youon Public Bicycle System Co Ltd, said it would acquire Shanghai-based bike rental brand Hellobike, as it attempts to gain more strength to compete with other major domestic bike-sharing companies. The move also marked the first merger in China's bike-sharing sector. Zhang Xu, a Beijing-based internet analyst, said the dominance of bike-sharing giants Ofo and Mobike has left little room for the further development of smaller bike-sharing companies. ""For small-sized bike sharing firms, the winter is coming. And we will see a new round of reshuffling in the industry,"" Zhang added. The bike-sharing frenzy started from and has boomed in China, with dozens of startups providing colorful shared bikes on the streets to enable environmentally friendly, convenient short trips. In July, the Ministry of Transport reported that China had more than 16 million shared bikes, posing serious challenges to city management for local governments. The flood of shared bikes across the nation has caused traffic chaos and safety concerns in urban areas. Earlier this year, 12 major cities across China introduced bans on new shared bikes. Guo Jinzhi, chairwoman of the Beijing Bicycle Industry Association, said companies should have taken that into account at the very beginning. ""Companies need to learn a lesson. The key is to better meet consumers' needs and to find solutions to adapt to the changing environment,"" she said. With a wide range of products and services flooding into the blossoming sharing economy, similar problems are popping up. Can all products for sale also be sharable? According to a report in Shanghai-based ThePaper.cn, one shared-umbrella investor is complaining that of the nearly 300,000 umbrellas their company deployed in more than 10 cities across southeastern China, almost none can now be found. The complaint may illustrate a point emphasized by Zhang, who says the sharing model does not work in every situation. ""Sharing startups need to consider how to actually meet consumers' specific needs and to share suitable items. And they also need to consider the maintenance"" for those items, he added."
0,"Beijing's Yanqing district plans to help more than 20,000 primary and secondary school students master skiing and skating skills over the next three years, a move designed to spur enthusiasm among the district's residents for the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games and beyond. Set to run from Feb 4 to 20 in 2022, the Winter Olympics will be held in Beijing and co-host city Zhangjiakou in adjacent Hebei province in less than 1,000 days. Yanqing, 74 kilometers northwest of central Beijing, will host several events, including Alpine skiing, bobsled, skeleton and luge. So far, up to 14,000 students in the district have taken skating and skiing lessons, said Zheng Shiyong, deputy director of Yanqing district's education commission. ""We will continue supporting and encouraging more people to participate in winter sports,"" he said, adding that around 17,000 students will experience winter activities by the end of this year. Some professional winter sports activities have also been designed into the district's education plans, with more professional instruction to students, according to Zheng. The district's education authorities also cooperated with its sports bureau to make winter ice and snow sports available to all residents in the area. ""We will have 110,000 people participating in winter ice and snow activities by 2022 in Yanqing,"" said Ma Zhiyong, deputy director of the sports bureau. So far, more than 47,000 people have received skating and skiing training and the number will continue to rise, with expectations of 70,000 enrolled by the end of this year, he added. He also said Yanqing has built more ski runs over the last two years, based on seasonal features and site conditions. Some important events and testing activities are expected to be held in Yanqing - for example, the 14th National Winter Games Alpine skiing speed events in 2020. Zheng, the deputy commissioner, said schools in Yanqing also created some outdoor ice rinks when winter weather conditions allowed, while in summer, manmade ice would be a good choice for campuses to open up skating practice. Yanqing will put more effort into increasing the number of qualified winter sports instructors, improving school curriculum and hastening construction of winter sports venues to add more flavor to the upcoming Winter Olympics in China, he said."
0,"Preparations for the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games have reached a key phase in which the construction of most venues has started and the focus has shifted to operations and management of the venues. ""Good operation of the venues is the key to ensure the Games go smoothly, "" Zhang Jiandong, a vice-mayor of Beijing and executive vice-president of the Olympic organizing committee, said on Thursday during the ongoing meetings of the 13th National People's Congress, the country's top legislative body. Zhang sees 2019 as a key year to prepare for the 2022 Winter Olympics for both Beijing and Zhangjiakou, Hebei province, the two co-hosts. ""In this year, we will operate the venues on a trial basis to know its conditions and make plans on how to equip them with appropriate facilities and equipment,"" he said. Meanwhile, the construction and renovation of venues will continue, including building ski runs and snow-making systems at an Alpine skiing center in Yanqing, a district in the city's northwestern suburbs, and renovating two major stadiums in Beijing, Zhang said. ""The center for Alpine skiing will meet the requirements for holding test competitions in October, while other venues will reach that stage next year,"" he said. Starting in February 2020, a series of 20 test events for the Winter Games will be scheduled, running through the first half of 2021. Seven of those will be held in Zhangjiakou. Zhangjiakou, which will host most snow events in 2022, has begun construction on 65 projects related to the Games, including venues and supporting infrastructure, said Wu Weidong, mayor of Zhangjiakou and an NPC deputy. To reduce the impact of changing weather on competitions, especially the ski events that are easily influenced by weather, authorities are building multiple meteorological stations in Yanqing and Zhangjiakou, to provide precise weather forecasts. ""The meteorological data will be monitored every 10 minutes and every 100 meters,"" Zhang said, adding that the work is underway as requested by the International Olympic Committee. All venues for the Games have been ordered to use clean energy, ""as we must fulfill our promise to host a green and sustainable Winter Olympics"", Zhang said."
0,"The surviving remnants of columns and gates in Beijing's Yuanmingyuan-or Old Summer Palace-will be reinforced to prevent them from collapsing, park officials said on Wednesday. The ruins have been preserved for nearly 160 years as a symbol of the nation's collective pain after they were destroyed by foreign military forces in the mid-19th century. Foundations of the stone remnants in the ruins of Yuanying Guan (Immense Ocean Observatory) will be strengthened as part of the project, which will last until late September, according to the administrative office of Yuanmingyuan Ruins Park. Yuanying Guan, which covers 1,465 square meters is a key site in the Xiyang Lou (Western Mansions) area of Yuanmingyuan. Its construction lasted from 1759 to 1783 during the reign of Emperor Qianlong in the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). Construction of Yuanmingyuan began in 1707 and continued for more than a century. Spectacularly beautiful at its peak, it is often referred to as ""the garden of gardens"", with its lush landscapes dotted with numerous temples, palaces and pavilions. Its 350-hectare area is about five times that of the Forbidden City in central Beijing. Besides functioning as an imperial resort, it was also a place where four Qing emperors (Qianlong, Jiaqing, Daoguang and Xianfeng) often handled affairs of state until 1860, when it was wrecked by invading Anglo-French expeditionary forces during the Second Opium War (1856-60). ""Yuanmingyuan is the zenith of Chinese gardens,"" said Liu Xiaodong, director of planning department of the administrative office. ""Xiyang Lou is a perfect combination of European architecture and Chinese skills-an example of cultural communication between the West and China."" Over time, rain, freezing and looting (villagers often took materials from the ruins to build their own houses during the 20th century's social upheavals) have made the few standing columns unstable. ""The bricks in the foundation of Yuanying Guan have disappeared, exposing the earth,"" Liu said. ""Thick vegetation is another threat."" Some foundations have collapsed. Liu said that if this situation continues, the stone columns themselves, no longer adequately supported, will be in danger. According to Qin Hai, an engineer at Tsinghua University's Architectural Design and Research Institute, the original foundation will be restored. ""Traditional skills will be used in renovation,"" he said. The bricks, for instance, are made of earth, sand, sticky rice, and lime. A new drainage system will be designed for the site to minimize the impact of rain, but the principle of minimum intervention will be followed for all cultural relics, he added. Liu, the planning director, said further laboratory analysis is needed to decide whether to take additional measures to repair the upright columns in the next phase of work. Yuanying Guan was a villa that belonged to one of Qianlong's favorite concubines. According to historical records, it featured 1,206 pieces of colored glass, which are depicted in Western paintings. As most wooden architecture in Yuanmingyuan was burned during the military vandalization in 1860, the surviving stone components of Yuanying Guan have become the most recognizable icons of Yuanmingyuan for Chinese people. For a long time, the style of the ruins gave the general public an incorrect impression that Yuanmingyuan was a European-style garden. However, large-scale archaeological excavations all over Yuanmingyuan in recent years have gradually unveiled a panoramic facade from underground. ""Everyone sees Yuanying Guan in their school textbooks,"" Liu said. ""It is also used as the logo of our park. Its cultural and historical significance is great, although it represents only a very small part of Yuanmingyuan. ""What we're doing is prevent potential hazards in the future. If the columns really collapsed, the loss would be irreversible."" The area will not be closed during the renovation, he said."
1,"Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts expressed deep concern on Monday over possible tit-for-tat tariffs between China and the United States, but is optimistic that a negotiated solution can be found. The governor, a businessman-turned-politician, said that the tariffs proposed by the Trump administration against China are ""certainly a cause for concern among farmers and ranchers"". Nebraska has been caught in the crossfire of a potential tariff war between the two countries, with Chinese retaliatory tariffs targeting a number of US agriculture products following the US' imposition of steel and aluminum tariffs in the name of national security and a threat to slap tariffs on $150 billion in Chinese imports under Section 301 of US Trade Act of 1974. ""Agriculture is the largest industry in Nebraska. It's about 20 percent of the overall state economy, and one in four jobs in Nebraska is tied back to agriculture,"" Ricketts said on Monday. He said there is concern when China is talking about potential tariffs and people in Nebraska are worried that something will happen with the tariffs. ""That brings uncertainty,"" said Ricketts, who traveled to China in 2015 and 2016. ""Now the good news is we got time to work this out,"" said Ricketts, a Republican who became governor in 2015. Noting that it's the beginning of the planting season, Ricketts said there is some time to conclude a trade negotiation with China. ""That's really what we are encouraging the administration to do. We want to get this trade negotiation done so we can continue to enjoy the market access in China and that mutually beneficial relationship through trade,"" he said. Ricketts' talk came three days after a senior US team led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin concluded two days of talks in Beijing on bilateral trade and investment issues. The 53-year-old Ricketts, a part-owner of the Chicago Cubs baseball team and whose father Joe Ricketts is the founder of brokerage firm TD Ameritrade, said there are opportunities for Nebraska to further expand into the Chinese market, citing China's resumption last year of US beef imports. China lifted its ban on US beef imports imposed about 14 years ago upon concern over mad cow disease. Nebraska is the top US beef-exporting state and was the fifth-largest pork exporter in 2017. China is Nebraska's second-largest goods-export market in 2017 after Canada and was its third-largest services-export market in 2016, trailing Canada and the United Kingdom. Oilseeds, grains and meat products are Nebraska's largest export items to China, according to a report by the US-China Business Council on April 30."

Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, made the call when joining a voluntary tree planting activity in Beijing. Leading officials at various levels should lead other officials and the public to plant trees voluntarily and treat the ecological environment as important as their lives, Xi said. Other Chinese leaders including Li Keqiang, Li Zhanshu, Wang Yang, Wang Huning, Zhao Leji, Han Zheng, and Wang Qishan also attended the event held at a large green area in the eastern suburbs of Beijing. The president carried water with some students while asking them about their studies and physical training and urging them to raise the awareness of environmental protection. Stating that afforestation has long been a fine tradition of the Chinese nation, Xi said that ""we plant trees here to fulfill our legal duties."" Monday's tree planting event was also a concrete action in building a beautiful China, advancing ecological conservation and improving people's livelihoods, he said. Equal importance should be given to both quality and quantity in land greening programs while taking a greening development path that is scientific, ecological, and frugal. Xi urged leading officials to continuously expand forest areas, and improve the quality of forests and the ecological system and its stability. They should do a good job in land greening and enrich their ways of performing duties in planting trees voluntarily, Xi said."

On Aug 3, Lin's wife, singer-actress Kiki Ding, gave birth to their son and the news was announced on his Sina Weibo account which has more than 11 million followers. On Aug 5, Lin released Flame In the Brook in cooperation with the Beijing I Hear U Charity Fund and Chinese music streaming service Net-Ease Cloud Music. Each song download costs 3 yuan ($44 cents), and the money raised is donated to the charity fund. More than 1.2 million yuan has been raised so far. Established in 2012, Beijing I Hear U Charity Fund offers help to hearing-impaired children by providing free cochlear implants and training the parents of hearing-impaired children. As of January 2018, 466 hearing-impaired children have received cochlear implant surgery. ""I have changed a lot since becoming a father, especially the way I see the world and my connection with children,"" said the 31-year-old when he held a mini concert in Beijing on Aug 29. The concert, which was also held in Shanghai on Aug 31, was part of the fundraising project. ""I am a lucky father because my son is healthy. But not all the families are lucky. I want to raise money for hearing-impaired children who with cochlear implants may recover from their hearing loss,"" adds Lin. The singer-songwriter rose to fame after winning Taiwan's reality TV singing competition One Million Star in 2007. He has released six studio albums and garnered a large fan base in Asia. Lin says that there are many things he loves about his musical career, and one of his favorite parts is the messages he delivers through his music.

At a meeting Wednesday, Li Yanhong, Baidu's CEO, live streamed while riding in a Baidu self-driving car on Beijing's fifth ring road.  The video went viral on social media, and caught the attention of traffic police. The public has since debated whether driverless cars should be allowed on the streets, as there are no clear regulations or laws covering their use.  Traffic police said they support technological innovation in driverless vehicles, but will investigate possible violations of existing traffic laws.

The search engine giant said in 2016 that it plans to mass-produce driverless cars in five years."
0,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration plans to shorten the length of validity for some visas issued to Chinese citizens, the State Department said Tuesday, as President Donald Trump works to counter alleged theft of US intellectual property by Beijing. The changes begin June 11. The State Department said that under the new policy, US consular officers may limit how long visas are valid, rather than the usual practice of issuing them for the maximum possible length. The State Department did not provide specifics. But a US official said that according to instructions sent to US embassies and consulates, Chinese graduate students will be limited to one-year visas if they are studying in fields like robotics, aviation and high-tech manufacturing. China identified those areas as priorities in its ""Made in China"" 2025 manufacturing plan. The instructions also say that Chinese citizens seeking visas will need special clearance from multiple US agencies if they work as researchers or managers for companies on a US Commerce Department list of entities requiring higher scrutiny. Those clearances are expected to take months for each visa application, the official said. The official wasn't authorized to comment publicly and requested anonymity. The application process itself won't change, the State Department said. The changes come as Trump seeks to crack down on China's trade practices, especially those related to cutting-edge industries that Beijing wants to dominate. On Tuesday, Trump renewed his threat to place 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese goods, in retaliation for what his administration says are China's unfair trade practices. The changes were foreshadowed in Trump's national security strategy issued in December. That document said the US would review and tighten visa procedures ""to reduce economic theft by non-traditional intelligence collectors."" It specifically mentioned possible restrictions on visas for foreign students studying science, technology, engineering and mathematics. AP"
1,"More than 30 central State-owned enterprises from the power, infrastructure and transportation industries have made plans to seize business opportunities expected from the planned creation of the Xiongan New Area in Hebei province, according to the website of the country's top SOE regulator on Monday. Central SOEs including China Telecommunications Corp, China Eastern Airlines, China National Machinery Industry Corp and China Energy Engineering Corp Ltd have all held top management meetings to discuss plans to develop new areas, according to the website of the State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission. To ensure sufficient clean energy supplies, China National Offshore Oil Corp said it will build a branch liquefied natural gas pipeline to the Xiongan New Area, stretching from its LNG supply network connecting its production base in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region to consumption markets in northern China. ""The new area will certainly bring in people, capital and consumer goods, which requires the companies to build hospitals, industrial parks, roads, airports, energy and water-supply facilities,"" said Lu Huapu, a professor at Tsinghua University and a member of the expert committee advising on the integrated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. Lu said central SOEs, particularly in infrastructure, telecommunications and transportation, are not only expected to be the first batch to move their headquarters and subsidiaries to the new area, but also the first group of project contractors to build the infrastructure of the area. Liu Qitao, chairman of China Communications Construction Co, said: ""Buildings, public transportation, parking, traffic management and logistics should all be supported by smart systems."" The new area has also brought growth opportunities to financial institutions and companies. China Construction Bank will establish a leading group to coordinate the company's business in the new area in its headquarters in Beijing, as well as setting up a regional branch in the area. China Merchants Group will also support the Xiongan New Area financially in all aspects, including bank loans, bonds, financing, public-private partnership and public listing business. For central SOEs, carrying out big-ticket projects in the new area is more convenient than conducting similar businesses in overseas markets, it would be easy for them to gain financial and policy support in the domestic market and there are fewer risks,"" said Li Jin, chief researcher at the Beijing-based China Enterprise Research Institute."

In early June, the Ministry of Transport conducted a field survey in Xiongan, which included visiting sites along the two canals. The team was headed by Chen Shengying, head of the ministry's transport planning and research institute. About two weeks later, the provincial transport authority sent a team to Beijing to discuss Xiongan's water transport blueprint.  Tang Jianxin, head of the team, said that the short-term, mid-term and long-term plans for water transportation in Xiongan New Area should be implemented as soon as possible. He also hoped that a three-year plan would be drafted soon and be included in the 13th Five-Year Plan of the Ministry of Transport. Historically Baoding was connected by waterway via Baiyangdian to Tianjin. Inland water transport from Baoding to Tianjin started in the Ming and Qing dynasties (1368-1911), from Baoding through Fuhe River to Baiyangdian Lake, and finally joined the Haihe River in Tianjin.  Fuhe River, Baiyangdian Lake, Daqing River were important inland shipping channels between Tianjin and Baoding for hundreds of years during the Ming and Qing dynasties."
0,"Ding Yi performed as Alfredo Germon, the lead male role in Giuseppe Verdi's opera La Traviata, at the Sydney Opera House in 2002. As the first Chinese tenor known to have sung at the cultural landmark in Australia, the role also led him to other performances there, such as in masterpieces   . Today when Ding looks back upon that time, he not just recalls his excitement and pride but also the contribution of his teacher, Shen Xiang, the late tenor and vocal music educator, from whom he had learned opera in the late 1980s. ""La Traviata was the first opera I learned with Shen. It brought back lots of memories of him when I performed in Sydney,"" says Ding. In early 1980s, when Ding, now 56, was a teacher at the Xi'an Conservatory of Music in Shaanxi province, Shen was teaching at the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing. ""Shen was a famous teacher and I didn't expect I would become his last student,"" Ding says. ""He not only trained me to use my voice to sing but also corrected my diction, because he spoke four languages-English, French, Italian and German."" During Spring Festival in February, Ding visited Shen's 95-year-old widow, Li Jinwei, a veteran soprano and music educator, and they talked about bringing together other students of Shen for a concert in tribute to their teacher on the 25th anniversary of his death this year. On Friday, some 54 singers, including veterans such as Yin Xiumei, Yu Junjian and Yan Weiwen, and young students from the choir of Beijing-based China Conservatory of Music, where Ding teaches, will perform at the concert, with repertories of popular Chinese folk songs and classic arias from operas, including   and  .,Ding will perform at the concert, too. ""I hope the concert will not only commemorate Shen but also inspire young music students in general,"" says Ding. Born in Tianjin, Shen enrolled to study English language and literature at Yenching University in 1940, and also learned music there. In the following year, he went to study English literature at St. John's University of Shanghai and was also admitted to the Shanghai National Music Academy to learn vocals. In 1944, he was expelled from the school because he refused to sing in a fund-raising concert for the Japanese army, which had then occupied Shanghai. Later the same year, at age 23, Shen held his first solo concert in Shanghai, which was a success. Shen was among those who laid the foundation of vocal music education in China and helped Chinese singers get international exposure. In 1984, he led a delegation to the Finnish Miriam Hailin First International Vocal Competition, where his student, mezzo-soprano Liang Ning, won the first prize in the women's group. Then, in 1985, at the second BBC Cardiff Singer of the World Competition, bass Liu Yue won the third place. Shen's other award-winning students include baritone Cheng Da, who won the third place in the International Vocal Competition held in Chile in 1989, and tenor Hei Haitao, who won the first prize in the Verdi International Vocal Competition in 1991. Shen himself also got called to judge international vocal competitions. Speaking about his teacher, mezzo-soprano Guan Mucun says: ""He has said that emotions should come first for a singer and then techniques, such as breathing, resonance and pronunciation. ""It is a valuable idea that we should share with our young singers today."" 7:30 pm, May 4. Poly Theater, 14 Dongzhimen Nandajie, Dongcheng district, Beijing."

Co-organized by the conference's news center and the Beijing Information Office, the tour took in the featured horticulture and iconic architecture of China and its capital, as well as the diverse horticulture featured in countries around the world. More than 60 reporters from 50 media outlets of 30 countries including Pakistan, Afghanistan, Costa Rica and Argentina joined the tour. With the theme of ""live green, live better"", the 503-hectare horticultural expo opened on April 29 and will run until Oct 7. More than 80 countries and international organizations have built 41 outdoor exhibition areas, comprised of 34 independent exhibition parks and seven jointly-built exhibition parks. The Chinese Pavilion, which covers 15,000 square meters, is a major landmark at the expo, where 31 provincial regions from the Chinese mainland have displayed their distinct cultures ranging from Beijing's traditions, Tianjin's villa buildings and the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region's Silk Road culture to Sichuan province's bamboo culture. Sone Thaw Tar Win Pyae, a journalist from Myanmar International Radio, said the expo is an ideal venue to see a city and a country's landscape. ""This is my second time in China, but the first time for me to take part in such an activity. It is amazing,"" she said. ""I'm really impressed by the Chinese Pavilion. The Shaanxi section also reminds me of my first visit to Xi'an."",Covering an area of 12,770 sq m, the International Pavilion has four exhibition areas, displaying various horticultural cultures including eco-themed wall displays, mobile gardens, flora competitions and exhibitions of countries around the world. Muhammad Imran, a journalist from Dawn News TV, said he could feel China's fast economic development and environmental protection from the expo visit. ""It is an enjoyable experience to see so many flowers from around the world in the International Pavilion,"" Muhammad said. ""I'm quite excited to find my country Pakistan also exhibiting our culture and products in the pavilion."" Ye Dahua, deputy head of the Beijing International Horticultural Exhibition Coordination Bureau, said the expo is one of the biggest events in the world. To date, the expo has received 800,000 visits, according to Ye. In addition to the horticulture exhibitions, the expo is hosting activities, such as a lighting show and robot performance. Advanced technologies including 5G, unmanned aerial vehicles and self-driving cars are also being showcased. ""The expo has attracted 110 countries to display their gardening culture, and it has gathered cultures around the world to provide visitors with a visual feast,"" Ye said."
0,"China is willing to expand common interests and properly settle differences with the Philippines to consolidate public support for their ties getting back to a sound track, Premier Li Keqiang said on Friday. Li made the remarks when meeting with Pantaleon Alvarez, speaker of the House of Representatives of the Philippines, in Beijing. Li said that a good neighbor friendship between the two countries meets the fundamental interests of both peoples and contributes to regional peace and stability. He said China is ready to deepen mutual trust and communication with the Philippines to sustain a healthy and sound growth of ties. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Li said China is ready to support the work of the Philippines, which holds the rotating chairmanship of the ASEAN this year, and work with all parties to improve China-ASEAN ties as well as regional cooperation. Alvarez said the Philippine legislative body supports the efforts of President Rodrigo Duterte in improving and developing ties with China. He said the two countries' consolidated cooperation has resulted in many new achievements, and this will contribute to cooperation with and consensus among Asian countries. Alvarez said he welcomes Li to the Philippines this year for the Leaders' Meetings on East Asia Cooperation. Ties between the two countries have continued to improve since Duterte's visit to China in October. The Philippine embassy in China has seen a 200 percent increase in visa applications for tourism and business, Ambassador Jose Santiago Santa Romana said, according to The Philippine Star. The ambassador said there had been a decline in the number of Chinese tourists but things have changed since Beijing lifted all travel advisories. He added that the Philippine government aims to double tourism arrivals this year. ""(We) will hit 1 million (arrivals) this year, so we are just scratching the surface,"" the ambassador said, noting that the nation's consulates in China are now deluged with visa applications. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Friday: ""I think it's a good thing that the number of Chinese people visiting the Philippines is increasing rapidly."" The improvement in ties ""has provided a good political environment for nongovernmental exchanges between the two countries,"" Hua said. ""In turn, strengthened friendly exchanges between the two peoples will definitely promote bilateral understanding and trust, consolidate public support for neighborly and friendly bilateral relations, and accumulate more positive energy for healthy and steady development of bilateral ties,"" she said. The two countries and their people will enjoy more concrete benefits as the two countries keep advancing their pragmatic cooperation in different fields, Hua said."

1,"Overseas expansion seems to be the new buzzword for Chinese internet startups as the industry looks to reap the rewards of the rapid development in the last two decades. The huge market potential also saw the emergence of Chinese internet behemoths like Baidu Inc, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and Tencent Holdings Ltd.  Unlike the internet giants which are focused on the domestic market, startups are looking to overseas expansion. These include bike-sharing platforms like Mobike Technology Co and Ofo Inc, tool and photography app developer Meitu Inc and live-streaming platform Yixia Tech.  What is of interest, though is that most of the founders of these firms are from the post-80s and post-90s generation, who are more clued on to the global markets.  Song Yuheng, an analyst at internet startup service provider 36Kr said in a report: ""China is now at the forefront of mobile internet development, which is fast emerging as a driver of economic growth.""  International expansion has become a critical component in the growth strategy for Chinese internet entrepreneurs, as well as a golden opportunity to export industries with competitive advantages to foreign countries, the report said.  Bike-sharing startup Mobike is a typical example. Currently, its orange-hued dockless bikes can be found in 200 global cities, with the company owning 7 million bikes, as well as having over 200 million registered users, according to the company.  Li Yuxian, vice-president of Mobike said the company aims to operate in more cities around the world by the end of the year.  Apart from China, the firm's cycles can be found in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, South Korea, Japan, England, Italy and the United States. Last month, it announced its operations in Berlin, Germany.  For now, even profit has been put on hold as the company continues its global push.  ""If we want to make money, we can, but making money is not our top priority,"" said Hu Weiwei, co-founder and president of Mobike. ""Profit is not the most important goal for us at the moment. We are focused on market expansion,"" she said.  Prior to entering a new city, Mobike said it will first conduct a detailed survey of the urban environment and communicate with the local government and transportation management departments to create a development plan.  The reason for its internationalization strategy is obvious. By July, major Chinese cities had reached a saturation point. There were up to 70 bike-sharing brands with 16 million cycles on the roads for a customer base of about 130 million, according to data from the Ministry of Transport.  Mobike's rival Ofo has also accelerated its expansion in overseas markets. It has more than 10 million bikes in 13 countries and in September officially launched services in the Czech Republic, Italy, Russia and the Netherlands.  Founded in 2014, the Beijing-based company is valued at more than $2 billion after raising $700 million in its latest round of financing in July.  The company aims to roll out 20 million bikes in 200 cities across the world by the end of the year after moving into markets in the United States, the United Kingdom, Singapore, Kazakhstan, Thailand, Malaysia, Japan and Austria.  ""Our platform was created with the ambition of improving the environment globally by introducing low-carbon transportation to urban dwellers,"" said Dai Wei, founder and CEO of Ofo.  Statistics from Beijing-based market consultancy iResearch showed that Chinese internet companies have expanded their presence in Japan, South Korea, Europe, the United States, Southeast Asia, Latin America, Middle East and North Africa. The number of these enterprises has surpassed 6,000, with over 10,000 products in overseas markets.  As a global mobile internet platform and innovator in mobile video and photography, Meitu's apps are used by more than 450 million monthly active users worldwide, generating more than 6 billion photos and videos each month. The company's internationalization has highlighted the huge market potential for Chinese mobile apps outside the country.  Its photo and video editing apps use patented facial recognition and machine learning algorithms to map each user's facial features, offering a precise and natural virtual makeup application and retouching for each user's unique skin tone and facial structure.  Established in 2008, the Xiamen-based company made its debut on the Hong Kong bourse last December. Currently, it has expanded into 26 countries and has more than 10 million active users in countries like India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia and Thailand.  The company is also stepping up efforts to gain more overseas users, said its chairman Cai Wensheng, adding the expansion will entail opening new offices, possibly in Europe, and offering localized versions of its products.  ""It is the best time for online video and entertainment industry to go global as the contents are interlinked,"" said Han Kun, CEO of Yixia Tech, the provider of the live streaming application Yizhibo."
1,"From the revamp of landscape lighting along a 20-kilometer section of the Huangpu River, to the training of 5,000 volunteers ready to greet the crowds, Shanghai is ready to impress the world with the inaugural China International Import Expo. With the slogan New Era, Shared Future, the world's first import-themed national-level expo is scheduled to open on Nov 5. The event is set to gather more than 3,000 exhibitors from over 130 countries, as well as political dignitaries, business leaders and heads of international organizations from around 150 countries and regions. ""We are ready to work with all relevant parties and make concerted efforts to ensure the first China International Import Expo is a great success and a first-class international event,"" Vice-Minister of Commerce Fu Ziying told a news conference in Beijing earlier this week. Running at the National Exhibition and Convention Center (Shanghai) until Nov 10, the CIIE is foremost an exhibition to strengthen business ties and provide foreign companies wider access to the immense Chinese market. The latest figures from the Ministry of Commerce show that a total of 82 countries and three international organizations will showcase their economic and trade achievements as well as featured products in a combined exhibition area of 30,000 square meters at the Country Pavilion for Trade and Investment at the expo. Twelve guest of honor countries will have their own characteristic pavilions, including the United Kingdom, Russia, Germany, Canada, South Africa and Pakistan. ""The UK is very excited about the possibilities the CIIE presents,"" said James Sassoon, chairman of the China-Britain Business Council, during an interview with the CIIE Bureau. ""So it has very good commitment from the government and business. And it's because we want to show off the best we have, whether it's in automotive, tourism, healthcare or creative industry, there is so much that the UK has to present right across the board,"" he said. At the Enterprise and Business Exhibition, a long list of Fortune Global 500 businesses, among other overseas companies, will show off their eye-catching new products and state-of-the-art technologies over a total booth area of 270,000 sq m. The area, already expanded twice from the original plans, will be equivalent to the size of 38 football pitches and can house more than 160,000 domestic and international buyers. ""CIIE, with strong support from the top Chinese leadership, will be a unique platform to guarantee a more open environment for international participation in China's economic growth by importing more of the latest technologies and ideas,"" said Kjeld Stark, president of Danfoss China. Danish multinational Danfoss Group is a global leader in providing green solutions for the climate, energy, food and infrastructure sectors. ""CIIE is a good indicator that China will accelerate its development by adopting Western technologies at a faster pace. This gives us more confidence in China's economy,"" he said. Meanwhile, Bayer's exhibits at CIIE will focus on health and nutrition, showcasing some of the German multinational company's latest research results and development concepts in pharmaceuticals, consumer health, crop science and animal health businesses. ""CIIE is a signature event for the Chinese government that highlights and supports China's policy and aim of further opening-up to the world,"" said Celina Chew, president of Bayer Group China. ""We expect to meet representatives of many diverse and exciting countries, companies, businesses and organizations with an interest in China, and look forward to exchanging ideas and finding opportunities for collaboration,"" she said.,Besides bustling business exchanges, the expo will serve as a platform for strengthening partnership in international free trade, while acting as a confidence booster for economic globalization and a countermeasure against protectionism. According to the Ministry of Commerce, the expo will feature a forum on the global economy and trade, with a star-studded lineup to provide their thoughts on shared prosperity. The Hongqiao International Economic and Trade Forum, with the theme ""spurring new vitality of global trade, creating an open and win-win scenario"", will be attended by over 2,000 government officials, international organization leaders, renowned entrepreneurs and academics from over 130 countries and regions. Speakers and panelists will include Alibaba's Jack Ma, Microsoft co-founder and TerraPower Chairman Bill Gates, and Angel Gurria, secretary-general of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The forum's three parallel sessions, focusing on trade and opening-up, trade and innovation, and trade and investment, respectively, will discuss major issues such as the new impetus for economic globalization, and the liberalization and facilitation of trade and investment. With only three days to go before the most significant event to follow the 2010 World Expo, Shanghai has been fine-tuning preparations for the upcoming import expo and is ready to welcome guests from across the world. Publicity covering the CIIE can be seen in almost every corner of the financial metropolis, and the new look Shanghai has put on for the expo has become the talk of the town. Light decorations have been added to a 20-km stretch of the city's signature Huangpu River, as well as four bridges that span it. Hundreds of thousands of pots of flowers now adorn the city. Shanghai has also trained 5,000 volunteers, who will offer various services including translation. At Shanghai Pudong International Airport, round-the-clock foreign language translation services have been put in place since late September. ""More than 20 volunteers who can speak a total of 12 foreign languages, including English, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, Russian, French, Arabian and Italian, are ready to offer help to our foreign visitors,"" said Shi Zhiying from the service center team at Pudong airport. To ease road traffic congestion and ensure the smooth running of the expo, the municipal government has announced plans to move two working days. The first two days of the expo, Nov 5 and 6, have been designated public holidays, with Nov 3 and 11 set as working days to compensate. Shanghai residents said they are looking forward to the positive changes that the event is expected to bring. ""Many foreign brands have entered China for the first time at the expo, and that is a good business opportunity,"" said Yang Xiaolan, a student at Shanghai International Studies University. ""I hope the expo can create more jobs for Shanghai and the whole country."" Wu Yanwen, a senior student at Tongji University, said: ""With CIIE, Shanghai residents will be exposed to more imported items, thus having a wider choice of quality products. I also hope more people can learn more about Shanghai and Chinese culture, and how we are marching toward the 'Chinese dream'."""
1,"Walking down memory lane, he recalled visits to the Longchamp workshops in western France and his grandmother's store on the Champs-Elysees in Paris. ""There were family discussions about new ideas, and later trips with his father to exhibitions and trade fairs around the world,"" a profile supplied by the company stated. Today, Cassegrain is the chief executive officer of the world-famous family-owned French fashion house in Paris. And he confessed that he never considered doing anything else. With about 1,500 retail outlets and businesses in 80 countries, Longchamp is a global blue-chip brand with a wide range of luxury collections, including handbags, luggage, accessories, shoes and ready-to-wear clothing. Annual sales for the group reached 566 million euros ($633 million) in 2015, the latest financial figures the company released. This was an increase of 14 percent compared to 2014. In China, local sales jumped by 30 percent during the same period, although the company did not release detailed numbers. ""We plan to open more stores in China to expand our presence,"" Cassegrain said. ""The Chinese economy is growing, and more and more people want to buy luxury products."" Back in April, the company opened its flagship store in China at the Kerry Center in the heart of Shanghai. This marked an important milestone for the group. ""We are confident about Longchamp's prospects in China,"" he said. In a far-reaching interview with China Daily, Cassegrain talked about the company's growth strategy, his management philosophy and his passion for skiing. We still have a lot of potential for growth. So far, we have 18 stores in China, but there is potential for us to open more at new locations. There are still cities where we are not present and where we could consider opening an outlet. In general, the Chinese economy is still growing, and there are more and more people here who have achieved a financial level where they can buy luxury European brands. I think for Longchamp there are a lot of opportunities. We will continue to grow in the years ahead. The new store we opened on Nanjing West Road of Shanghai is a big investment and a significant step for the brand. In October, we will open a new store in Beijing at a landmark shopping mall on Wangfujing Street. We are considering opening stores in second-tier cities that we are not present in, such as Changsha, in the coming months. I think our brand is unique and that means we will be able to reach a wide range of people. We are not a niche brand, so we don't focus on a specific category of client. Our customers in Europe can be teenagers, mothers, grandmothers or entire families. It is difficult to pinpoint a precise category for our products. One of the reasons for our success is that we can sell to a large variety of people. The Longchamp range is very broad, with a lot of colors, shapes and price ranges. How do we reach them? First, we open a store in the right location, to advertise our brand to the public. I think that is very important. Moreover, we have to use all the communication methods that we can, including newspapers, magazines and online channels, such as WeChat. The only official channel is through our Longchamp WeChat account. We don't sell any products on the platforms that you mentioned above. We want to develop online channels and have already sold a lot of our products via the internet in the United States and Europe. It is our plan to continue developing our online sales channel in China. The biggest opportunity is the market and the consumer. China is a huge market and there are a lot of opportunities for us. So far, we have only scratched the surface. I think we still have a lot of potential as there are so many people here that don't know our brand. The challenge is that we need to adapt to the way business works here and how to communicate with our customers. Another challenge is to get good store locations. You need to be very patient. We spent five years looking for the location of the store on Nanjing West Road in Shanghai. It is true that a lot of Chinese customers buy products overseas. As the market is becoming more mature, the goal of our company is to sell more here. We want to bring more business to China-that is our strategy. I am very confident with our business in China. The market is still growing as people's income levels rise. Well, to be honest, it is not just about big achievements. I believe I can make a small one every day before I go home in the evening. The plan at Longchamp is to work as a team and to achieve as a team. A great deal is about trial and error. We try many things and very often we failed. But it doesn't matter as we move on to something else and we try to learn from our mistakes. You must retain a balance between control and freedom. China is a very specific market, so we trust our local team to do the right things. We want to give them freedom and control in line with the brand value. As long as the brand value and image are respected, we offer a lot of freedom. We need our local teams to be independent, so they are able to manage by themselves. My sister is the creative director and her team are always looking for fresh ideas. It could come from anywhere such as a painting. The creative process is very mysterious and ongoing. She is never on vacation and is always dreaming up new ideas. I enjoy skiing very much. It is my favorite hobby, but then I like most sports.

0,"HONG KONG -- The mutational mechanism of a rare and deadly brain cancer has been uncovered by scientists from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, providing new therapeutic lead to the disease. Starting off at nerve cells around the spine and brain, lower-grade glioma (LGG) is the early form of sGBM -- one of the deadliest brain cancers. While sGBM can be treated with surgery or an oral chemotherapy drug, most of these malign tumors would mutate and return with mortality rate reaching almost 100 percent. In their latest study made public on Monday, the team led by Wang Jiguang, assistant professor at the university's Division of Life Science and Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, analyzed and integrated the genomic data of 188 sGBM patients, including newly collected samples from Chinese mainland and South Korean patients. The study found that about 14 percent of the sampled sGBM patients displayed mutations in this gene. Taking reference from this discovery, the university's collaborators, Jiang Tao and his team from Beijing Neurosurgical Institute and Beijing Tiantan Hospital, identified a drug molecule named PLB-1001 that can reach the tumors in the brain. The molecule shows remarkable potency in selectively targeting sGBM tumors and those displaying further gene mutations. The clinical trial of PLB-1001 on 18 recurrent patients at late cancer stage returned with a partial positive response in two patients. After being prescribed a daily dosage ranging from 50 to 300 mg at Beijing Tiantan Hospital, the two patients experienced significant tumor shrinkage, with relieved symptoms and little side effects, lasting for more than 12 weeks. The outcome of this clinical trial is significant in a sense that it furthers the knowledge about sGBM treatment, Wang said, adding that developing computational models on cancer evolution helps predict cancer cells' future behavior and prioritize treatment options. Wang said more studies on PLB-1001 are needed to see if it can be used in conjunction with other drugs in achieving more persistent results. The findings were published in scientific journal Cell on Nov 29."
1,"Zhang Hui, a clerk working at a technology company in Yizhuang, a southern suburb of Beijing, likes to go straight from work to a newly opened fresh food supermarket－7Fresh－where she chooses her favorite seafood dish, say, lobster or crab. She doesn't take the food home, but asks restaurant staff to cook the seafood on-site for her and eats at a dining area of the supermarket near her company. ""The supermarket impressed me a lot as I have never had such an experience before. If I am not willing to go out to dine, I can order online through an app and have it delivered within half an hour. Apart from seafood, I can choose meat, fruit, vegetables, dairy, bakery, wine and even flowers,"" Zhang said. The brick-and-mortar store is the first offline fresh food supermarket owned by Chinese e-commerce giant JD. Covering an area of 4,000 square meters, it started official operations on Jan 4. The rapidly growing number of China's high-income consumers has become a key driver of premium brands and other high-quality food products, especially imported meat and freshly caught seafood. Major e-commerce companies have tapped into the fresh food sector, opening such supermarkets as well as investing in the supply chain and logistics infrastructure. These stores integrate the online and offline worlds with logistics and data, enabling customers to shop, order groceries for home delivery and eat in-store－a one-stop food center experience. Various options are offered, including frozen seafood, meat, fruit and flowers. Although experts said the fresh food supermarket is still in an initial stage and needs time to see whether the brick-and-mortar store can make a profit, the new model is already changing China's traditional retail sector. ""Fresh food is the most demanding category in e-commerce, and covers a range of fields including logistics, finance and users operation. But at the same time, it has huge market potential,"" said Lyu Haoze, an analyst of China E-Commerce Research Center. Lyu added the online fresh food sector has entered a phase of reshuffling, and surviving enterprises are likely to see explosive growth. Wang Xiaosong, the JD senior vice-president who runs 7Fresh, said the company will open more than 1,000 such stores across the country in the next three to five years. Seventy-five percent of the products sold at the store are fresh products. As Chinese consumers are increasingly concerned about food safety and the product supply chains, JD said it has taken a series of measures to ensure the product quality. ""We have a special procurement team to source products from all over the world directly and ensure the quality of the products,"" Wang said. They also have a product quality control team to verify the qualification of suppliers, and do a spot check on all products before they are put on the shelves, he added. ""For the traditional supermarkets, inventory turnover rate is more than 30 days. For us, it is shortened to fewer than four days－guaranteeing freshness of all products sold in the store,"" Wang said. In January 2016, JD launched JD Fresh as an independent fresh food business unit. The fresh food supermarket leverages JD's nationwide cold-chain logistics network, ensuring that all of its fresh products are transported in frozen or refrigerator trucks. The whole process will be monitored. According to market research company iResearch Consulting Group, China's fresh food retail market is developing rapidly, with a growth rate of more than 50 percent each year on average. The transaction volume of China's online fresh food market reached about 139.13 billion yuan ($21.6 billion) in 2017, an increase of 59.7 percent. Hema Xiansheng, a fresh food chain invested by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, is also likely to reshape the landscape of China's retail industry. As a pioneering example of Alibaba's ""new retail"" strategy, which integrates online with offline shopping and provides a refreshing shopping experience, Hema will offer 24/7 services after the coming Spring Festival starting on Feb 16. ""Consumers could not only buy fresh food from us, but also adult products, maternal, baby and female necessities, and other daily household products,"" said Hou Yi, CEO of Hema, at the second new retail summit in Shanghai held Jan 10-11. On Jan 3, Hou said Hema will open 30 fresh food supermarkets throughout Beijing this year. The company claims that customers within a three-kilometer radius of a store can have their shopping items delivered within 30 minutes. The online giant has opened five stores in Beijing and will concentrate more on the Beijing market apart from expanding its business across China, according to Hou. It opened its first offline store in Shanghai two years ago. ""Only when the online giants continue to expand and operate a certain number of fresh food supermarkets can we discuss the profitability issue,"" said Lu Zhenwang, CEO of Wanqing Consultancy in Shanghai, adding the cost of warehousing, cold chain transportation and supply chain construction is very high. Chinese consumers are pursuing a high-quality lifestyle along with the consumption upgrades. However, the shelf life of fresh food is short, so the cold chain logistics plays an important role in this sector, Lu said, adding that quality control of the fresh food is also significant. Lyu added that the appearance and expansion of fresh food supermarkets will inevitably grab the market share of traditional stores, gaining favor from a new generation of young consumers. ""This will force the traditional supermarkets such as Walmart and Carrefour to transform, expanding their services online."""
1,"In recent years, I've seen so many innovations in China's internet industry. And it has made a huge difference across the world. I believe China will become the online linchpin, leading a number of revolutionary transformations in the sharing economy, transportation and artificial intelligence. The most interesting development is how people take things online and then apply them offline again to change existing industries. The artificial intelligence technology behind ride-sharing is now being used to help taxi companies and bus operators to revolutionize the way they manage drivers, and vehicles. Traffic lights have existed for centuries but now Didi scientists are using big data analytics to manage them real time. Technology is not only about expensive gadgets but a life necessity such as affordable, on-demand mobility for everyone. The ability of technology is to bridge gaps and be a force of inclusion rather than exclusion. This is the trend that will carry China and the rest of the world toward a more interconnected and shared future. : China's internet technology and applications have evolved alongside the rapid development of the country's economy. Our mobile internet technology and apps are currently leading the world. We are also innovators in the internet field. The most innovative products may come from the areas of artificial intelligence, or AI, and mobile video. As AI technology sweeps across the world, countries are introducing new laws and policies to secure the development of this industry. Additionally, mobile videos, especially short ones, have experienced high speed development. : The so-called ""Copy to China"" model has seen a distinct shift in recent years. In fact, in sectors like fintech, China has the scale and technology to lead innovation globally. The prevalence of mobile payments has unlocked new economic opportunities for people and small businesses. Nowadays, four Chinese consumers in five will tell you that they are comfortable going out with only their smartphones and no cash. People, including the elderly, buy groceries from street vendors by scanning a printed QR code using their mobile phones. You just don't see this in other parts of the world. In addition to bringing convenience for buyers, mobile payment has also helped street vendors address the long standing issue of fake bank notes. Another area that China is well positioned to compete globally is the application of AI to transform traditional businesses. The tangible benefit of applying AI to services has the power of dramatically increasing productivity. This in turn will give people greater access. : Powerful internet countries have many similar traits, but I think the most important ones are being inclusive and forward-looking. Didi's rapid growth in China proves how important these characteristics can be. For example, when the rest of the world was bickering about whether online ride-hailing and ride-sharing was legal or not, China became the first country to give it the all clear on a national basis. It was a huge step for a country with the vision to see the coming revolution in transport. With ride-sharing, electric vehicles and autonomous driving, China will lead the next wave in transportation across the world. : As far as I am concerned, internet power should have the following characteristics, such as a large population and a well-equipped network infrastructure. It should also be strong scientifically with innovation capability and a pool of internet talent. A good capital environment is another important part. China has nearly all those characteristics. But the country still needs to grasp the coming opportunities, meet the needs of consumers and sustain innovation. : A country with a strong internet sector needs many ingredients. China luckily has most of them, such as good internet infrastructure and a vast talent pool for the sector. It also has a large savvy population and a high mobile internet penetration rate, as well as supportive government policies. When you have all of those ingredients, it is only natural to see cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hangzhou become talent magnets globally. The challenge is how you make the overall environment even more attractive to innovation. We need more collaboration between academia and industry to accelerate the process from research and development to application of new technologies. That will be the key to success. : Yes, of course. China is the world's largest and probably the most complex internet market. Tech companies can gain rich insight and develop advanced technological capabilities here, which will help them go further. Take Didi as an example. The intensity of traffic congestions and mobility inefficiency in China is unparalleled. The services we have developed to deal with these problems can be used elsewhere. We have managed to introduce quite a few services, which we have created for China's market, to the wider international communities. Our minibus and hitch programs have been adopted respectively by our partners in Brazil and Southeast Asia, where they can perfectly meet local demands. : Yes, of course. One of the most important experiences gained from China's sustained internet development has been innovation. Whether it is the portal era, the e-commerce era or the era of the shared economy, innovation has always been a driving force for development. : Definitely. A large percentage of people are underserved in terms of financial services, especially in developing markets. Digital payment systems can greatly reduce the cost of serving customers, especially with basic financial services, such as savings accounts, and even wealth management. Ant Financial's technology capability and experience in providing digital financial services in China have stood the test of time and scale. For example, we processed 256,000 transactions per second during the peak of the Singles Day shopping festival. By working with our global partners, we are confident that the same technological capability can be leveraged in other parts of the world to make financial services more inclusive. It will give people equal opportunities. : One of the greatest revolutions is the integration of the three internets. That is the internet of information, the internet of energy, and the internet of transportation. This revolution is not only the result of technological advancement, but an inevitable choice to change a centuries old unsustainable model of development. Integration will change this. Cars will not be owned but shared. Energy produced in an eco-friendly way will be connected to a web of charging stations. Transportation will be arranged and deployed on big data-powered platforms. Parking lots will make way for schools and green spaces. The entire landscape of cities will be changed for the better. : During the past few years, China's internet industry has gone through many changes and innovations. These include online to offline, or O2O, the shared economy, mobile live broadcasts and short video. Changes will affect our future since all of them are based on meeting people's needs. : Mobile payments moving into more offline areas and covering more geographical regions became an important change this year. The trend will dramatically change our lives and the real economy. We are already seeing rapid growth in the shared economy sector, such as bikes and home stay. And mobile payments are helping this industry grow. : Didi caters for 25 million rides a day. Every single one is arranged, deployed and completed by the power of AI. Didi is fully committed to big data, machine learning and artificial intelligence, which can continuously improve the efficiency of our platform. Every day, we process 20 billion routing requests and deal with 15 billion location points. Didi's AI capabilities are based on the enormous amount of data. By analyzing the behavior and locations of our users - both the drivers and the passengers - we are getting better at deploying capacities. : Artificial intelligence is affecting all industries and Yixia is no exception. We have already been applying this technology on our Miaopai and Yizhibo platforms. In October, we cooperated with SenseTime and Star VC in exploring video advertisements using artificial intelligence and augmented reality in our content. The technology will also be applied to our Miaopai and Yizhibo platforms. : AI is one of the pillars of our BASIC strategy - namely Blockchain, AI, Security, Internet of Things and Cloud Computing. The technology has tremendous potential to increase productivity, which is something we must continue to improve, so people can access more products and service. Our AI capabilities include voice recognition, natural language processing and image recognition. We are already applying and constantly exploring new ways to use this technology in our products and services. For example, our AI powered real-time risk management platform, AlphaRisk, reduces fraud on Alipay with a loss rate of one in 1 million. Another example of an AI application is the intelligent assistant within our Alipay app. It is able to handle interactions with a user by answering questions like a human being. : The integration of three internets, namely the internet of information, the internet of energy and the internet of transportation, will transform the landscape of cities. : Short video is hot within the internet industry and this trend will continue. With the development of the mobile internet, traditional image-text methods will give way to vivid, short videos. This is because video meets the needs of consumers looking for information. The trend also gives us an advantage as Miaopai is now one of China's most successful short video platforms. According to the latest data from QuestMobile, the leading big data service provider, our monthly user scale has exceeded 310 million for two consecutive months. : Technologies, such as the internet of things, blockchain and biometrics, are going to expand quickly with wide application. Blockchain allows an online ledger to be open to public scrutiny, creating a level of trust that was not there before. We are already piloting the application of blockchain in areas such as philanthropy and mutual insurance, so as to foster more trust-based growth."
1,"Beijing-Shanghai High-Speed Railway Co Ltd, a unit of China Railway Corp and the company that runs the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway, is planning to raise funds through an initial public offering on the A-share market, it said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday. Launched in 2011, the Beijing-Shanghai railway line is one of China's most profitable high-speed routes. The public float is seen as a significant step in the State-owned enterprise's efforts to promote mixed ownership reforms and optimize its capital structure. Company officials expect to complete the preparatory listing work by the end of this year. The Beijing-Shanghai High-Speed Railway is 1,318 kilometers long and spans seven provinces and municipalities including Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong and Jiangsu. It is regarded as the country's premium transportation asset and has since its start in 2011 hosted 940 million trips. A spokesperson for China Railway emphasized that by raising funds from the market, the company will be able to securitize its assets. Securitization is the practice of pooling various types of contractual debt, such as mortgages, and selling their related cash flows to third-party investors as securities. ""It will increase funding for the transportation business, boost socioeconomic efficiency, services and help State-owned railway enterprises establish a market-oriented operating system,"" the spokesperson said. China Railway has been actively engaging in securitization and optimization of its assets. Last April, the company signed a strategic cooperation agreement with the Shanghai Stock Exchange for railway construction bonds, railway capital securitization and plans for its subsidiaries to go public. Earlier this month, China Railway Special Cargo Services Co Ltd, another subsidiary of China Railway, completed its share transfer, another significant push in its mixed ownership reform. Zhao Jian, a professor at Beijing Jiaotong University, said such steps were necessary to ease the financing constraints in railway construction. ""For example, profitable companies such as the Beijing-Shanghai High-Speed Railway Co Ltd can go public and become financing platforms for China Railway,"" he said. ""There are a number of premium assets in the country's railway system, such as the commercial properties around railway stations and railway projects for resource transportation,"" said Xu Weihong, chief economist of AVIC Securities. ""Profitable assets can be securitized so as to lower China Railway's debt ratio,"" he said."
0,"The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said on Friday that 74 outbreaks of African swine fever have been reported in 47 cities in 20 provincial-level areas, with the latest one confirmed on Friday morning in Beijing's Fangshan district. Since 90 percent of Beijing’s pork comes from other areas, the new outbreak will not impact the supply of pork in the city,Feng Zhongwu, head of the ministry's animal husbandry and veterinary department, told a news conference on Friday. He said that since the first outbreak occurred in Shenyang, Liaoning province, on Aug 1, China had culled 600,000 pigs to curb the spread of the contagious disease as of Thursday. African swine fever is a highly contagious, viral disease that infects pigs. It does not affect humans or other animal species. Quarantine orders have been lifted in 24 areas in seven affected provinces, Feng said, including all quarantined areas in Henan and Jiangsu provinces. ""The epidemic features a dispersive pattern, but we have contained the spread through effective prevention and disease-control measures,"" he said, adding that the chance of a sudden surge in outbreaks across the nation was slim. The ministry has banned feeding pigs with kitchen waste since the end of August, and ramped up its supervision of livestock transport. Research released on Friday showed that 46 percent of outbreaks have been caused by people or vehicles carrying and spreading the disease to pigs, and 23 cases occurred as a result of feeding kitchen leftovers to pigs, Huang Baoxu, deputy director of the China Animal Health and Epidemiology Center, told the news conference. He added that the virus found in China was likely to have originated in Georgia, Russia or Poland, as analysis of the virus’ genome sequence suggested a 99.95 percent similarity between it and the strains in those three countries. Investigations to determine the origin of the epidemic are ongoing, he said."
1,"Stocks related to the Xiongan New Area in North China's Hebei province are seeing a fresh uptrend as construction for the zone pushes ahead. Shares of 15 companies involved in the Xiongan area's development, including those in environmental protection, mechanical engineering and construction materials, surged by the 10 percent upside limit on March 8, according to a report by Shenzhen Economic Daily. About 34 percent of 79 Xiongan-related shares rose by more than 5 percent, Chongqing Economic Times reported. The strong performance came right on the day when Chen Gang, Party chief of Xiongan, spoke about the progress made in the new area at the two sessions in Beijing. On March 12, several Xiongan-related stocks also surged with some of them hitting the daily limit, the finance section of Sina reported. The share price increases were also seen last month. On Feb 22, the first trading day after the Spring Festival holiday, shares in several listed companies, including Hebei-based Tangshan Jidong Cement, Beijing Hanjian Heshan Pipeline Co, and CSD Water Service climbed by the daily limit, Chongqing Economic Times reported. The planning and construction of the Xiongan New Area, a new economic zone about 100 kilometers southwest of Beijing, have been steadily progressing since the area was established on April 1 last year to help spare Beijing of functions unrelated to its status as national capital. About a year later, the planning brief of Xiongan was almost completed, according to He Lifeng, minister of the National Development and Reform Commission, the country's top economic planner. Some projects, such as the intercity railway between Beijing and Xiongan, and the afforestation project, have already started, He said on March 6 during a news conference on the sidelines of the first session of the 13th National People's Congress. Investors were cheered by the positive news in the area, but their enthusiasm for Xiongan should not be blind, Huang Cendong, an analyst with Sinolink Securities, was quoted as saying in a report in Shenzhen Economic Daily. Huang said shares related to Xiongan are at present mostly themed speculation and companies that will successfully participate in the building of the area in the future may be sought after in the stock market. Last year, after central authorities announced the establishment of the new area, the share prices of certain companies rose for several successive days, settling in a significantly higher territory. These companies are either located in the counties that are earmarked for Xiongan or involved in the area's transportation, construction materials and infrastructure construction. However, such stocks, known as ""Xiongan concept stocks"", cooled after securities supervision authorities subsequently enhanced measures to prevent financial risks. Shenzhen Economic Daily's report said after development policies in the new area are nailed down, listed companies will have opportunities to realize their value, rather than just conceptual investment."
0,"In 2012, tons of recyclable wastes were disposed every day in several waste disposal hubs in Beijing's suburbs. People who worked there usually lived in shacks of few square meters in a dirty and stinky environment. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in November that year, Beijing has adopted measures to clean these disposal hubs so as to echo the national strategy of enhancing ecological civilization.,  In 2017, China Daily returned to the villages and compared the current situation with photos taken five years ago. Meadows and lines of seedlings have taken the place of the waste areas. New disposal hubs have been built in planned areas outside Beijing and equipped with new technology and infrastructure that makes recycling more eco-friendly and efficient. With a better environment, the transformation of waste disposal villages will contribute to Beijing's environmental improvement and help get rid of its non-capital functions."
1,"If all Chinese people secured lower-cost or free internet access, the internet industry could see exponential growth in market scale, analysts said. ""As more Chinese people enjoy the convenience of surfing the internet, free access to the internet has become increasingly important,"" said Zhang Fayou, an IT industry insider and co-founder of LinkSure Network, at a forum during the ongoing Fifth World Internet Conference. ""Through leveraging advanced technologies, including big data, users in the country are now able to access free Wi-Fi in all kinds of places. Chinese wisdom is bringing benefits to people from both urban and rural areas, and even overseas,"" said Zhang. The internet industry in the world's second-largest economy has seen rapid growth over the last five years. From shopping and dining to housing and financing, over 800 million Chinese people are active in cyberspace today, boosting the development of internet-related businesses. Nine of the world's top 20 high-market-value internet giants are Chinese, while five years ago, only two made the list, according to the Internet Trends report released by Mary Meeker, a partner at venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers. Data from market consultancy International Data Corp show China's internet industry market scale grew by 97.8 percent in the first quarter of this year. However, nearly half of the population still has little or limited access to the web, and many live in rural or poorer areas. Wang Li, who works at an internet company in Beijing, said in his hometown, a village of Nanyang in Henan province, only one family in three has Wi-Fi connectivity. ""Every time I return home during Spring Festival, it could cost several hundred yuan to use mobile data, just for a week,"" he said. He added that most of the rural residents there are older people, who do not have much interest in using the internet. At the end of 2017, internet penetration in rural areas was 35.4 percent, compared with 71 percent in urban areas, according to data from the China Internet Network Information Center. Tian Li, director of the Internet Development Research Institution of Peking University, told People's Daily that companies are less interested in these regions due to the poor infrastructure and farmers' low internet adoption. But this is changing. According to a report by the China International Electronic Commerce Center in October, online shoppers living in villages spent over 632.2 billion yuan ($91 billion) nationwide from January to June, up 34.4 percent year-on-year. Internet giants are scrambling to outpace each other in the race to acquire vast user bases, as the surest means to increasing their market value. Ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing has built the largest online traffic network by serving 450 million passengers. Ant Financial, a 4-year-old startup, is now known as the world's largest third-party payments platform, valued at $155 billion. The estimated value of China's largest on-demand online service provider Meituan-Dianping has reached about $60 billion. The question experts are now asking is: how much larger could the market grow if barriers to accessing the internet were lowered, or even removed entirely? ""The internet is playing an increasingly important role in modern life. It has become a public facility,"" said Wang Zhe, an economics lecturer at Macquarie University. ""More cities are providing free internet access for residents. Companies are also beginning to work on products such as sharing networks."" Free Wi-Fi services are already widely available in public areas such as railway and subway stations, restaurants, stores and exhibition centers. Wang Li from Nanyang said he tends to use public internet-sharing software, such as Wi-Fi Master Key, while watching videos to save money. ""At first I saw some of my friends were using the internet for free. I asked them how to do it, then I tried it myself."" In 2013, LinkSure Network became one of the first providers of free public internet access services with Wi-Fi Master Key, which now has more than 900 million users worldwide. ""The lower the price, the higher the demand. When the cost of using the internet radically decreases, people will become more willing to join and spend more time reading the news, searching for information, doing their shopping and playing games online,"" said Zhang from LinkSure Network. About 20 percent of its customers are first-time netizens, and their average time online is 1.7 times higher than non-customers, according to the company. Chen Zhaoxiong, vice-minister of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, told Xinhua News Agency that the government will encourage free internet services in more public spaces. Such services are common in the West. According to Luigi Gambardella, president of ChinaEU, the EU's WiFi4EU initiative is supported by millions of euros and aims to expand free high-speed wireless internet connections in public spaces, such as hospitals, libraries and public squares. ""Free internet access in public areas plays a key role in improving economic growth, social mobility, computer literacy and education,"" Gambardella said. ""Wi-Fi hot spots could help China to improve its internet penetration rate, which still lags behind North America (at 95 percent) and Europe (at 85.2 percent),"" he said. According to Gambardella, universal free internet access may still be a dream, but providing free connection in public places, particularly in rural areas, should be on the political agenda. ""I believe free Wi-Fi hot spots will boost social development and bring economic benefits."" Wang Zhe of Macquarie University said free internet access would significantly expand the number of netizens, creating more demand. ""Users in rural areas would demonstrate their unique characteristics, which would help make the internet industry more diverse and balanced,"" he said. ""In general, it would enlarge the whole scale of the internet industry."" But such a move would also reduce the profit of traditional telecom carriers, he said. Li Daxiao, chief economist at Shenzhen-based Yingda Securities, said scrapping the traditional profit model of charging for internet access could be offset by the greater business potential of a larger user base, for example via advertisement revenue. ""Using WeChat, reading e-mails and listening to the radio doesn't require payment, but the value behind those businesses is substantial,"" he said. ""Monetizing the internet is not as simple as buying services."" If universal free internet access became a reality, China would accelerate to first place in the global internet industry, with strengthened competitiveness based on higher network traffic, he said. The challenges are how to popularize the internet in remote areas and improve connectivity in less-populated regions, such as high mountains and grassland, Li said. The safety of personal information while using shared internet services is also a cause for concern for customers. Zhu Huandong, a legal specialist in Jiangsu province, said he used to log into free internet services at libraries on campus. ""I was worried whether others could see and even copy my essays,"" he said. Now, he said he hardly uses free Wi-Fi in public areas. Every month, he pays 186 yuan to enjoy mobile internet with no network limitation. But many are not as cautious as Zhu. He Ni, a 30-year-old online retail worker in Hunan province, said she is not afraid as long as there are no requests for passwords. ""If there was free internet everywhere, of course I would use it."""
0,"In one week, Shanghai will start enforcing its first regulation on domestic waste management, joining other large Chinese cities piloting a shift to make garbage classification compulsory, instead of voluntary. Since the beginning of this century, China has encouraged people to sort household garbage voluntarily. While more people have realized the importance of garbage classification, the effect was not so great in terms of collection. Shanghai's regulation requires people to sort trash into four categories - dry garbage, wet garbage (kitchen waste), recyclables and hazardous waste. Individuals who fail to do so may be fined up to 200 yuan ($29.11), while companies and institutions face fines of up to 50,000 yuan. Liu Xinyu, a researcher with the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, said that the significance of this legislation is to transform the past voluntary action into the compulsory action of every citizen. Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Hangzhou have enacted or revised regulations on garbage classification to enhance the guidance of people's actions, strengthen classification in the whole process and supervise law enforcement. At a meeting of the Beijing Municipal People's Congress at the end of May, representatives have proposed revisions to the city's regulation on domestic waste, adding more punishments for offenses. Wu Xiangyang, a researcher with the Beijing Academy of Social Sciences, said that garbage classification work was not so ideal in the past because of the lack of forceful measures, and the revision will place restrictions on people's behavior. Guangzhou put into practice its regulation on garbage classification starting July 1 last year. In August, one resident became the first to be fined 200 yuan for violating the regulation. While large cities piloted the forceful measures, the central authority has recently issued a notice to ask all cities at the prefecture level and above to start work on the promotion of household garbage classification this year. The 46 cities currently involved in a household garbage classification pilot program should set up a system to classify and dispose of their household garbage by 2020, the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development said. By 2022, every city at the prefecture level and above should have at least one district where all household garbage is classified, and by 2025 they should have their own household garbage sorting and disposal systems."

0,"A new transit card that works on public transport in 190 Chinese cities was issued on Monday in Shijiazhuang, capital of northern China's Hebei province. The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Interoperability Card is designed for use on all bus and subway systems in Beijing, Tianjin and all 11 cities in Hebei, aiming to provide convenience for passengers and better regional integration. Beijing and Tianjin have also issued such cards. They can also be used in cities that have joined a nationwide traffic pass union, which had 190 members in 2017 and will be expanded to more than 220 cities by the end of this year, said Li Yang, deputy manager of State-owned Shijiazhuang Smart Card Science and Technology Co, which issued the latest card. Passengers with the card can enjoy the same discount policies as local citizens when taking public transport in a certain city, Li said. ""The card can spare the trouble of buying new transit cards or tickets when a person goes to another city,"" Li said. Wang Yuling, an official from the Hebei Development and Reform Commission's Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei integrated development office, said coordination of regional development in recent years has driven a growing number of business people and workers to travel between Beijing, Tianjin and cities in Hebei. ""Easy payment methods for public transport can make business trips more convenient and save time, thus encouraging people to be more actively involved in and make contributions to the coordinated development of the region,"" Wang said. Xiao Ya, a regional manager at a recruitment company in Shijiazhuang, said she is always on business trips to different cities in China, especially to Beijing and Tianjin, and used to carry different cards in her purse for buses or subways. ""Each time, before I left for a business trip, I had to find and take the exact traffic card of my destination city,"" Xiao said. ""Now I just need one card no matter where I go."" The card will be sold only in Shijiazhuang, but it can be recharged in other cities where it works and will be rechargeable online in the future. Many cities in the union have issued such cards. More than 13 million cards that can be used in different cities have been sold, a Ministry of Transport spokesman said in March. The ministry aims to expand the union to cover public transport in rural areas by 2020."
0,"BEIJING - Uichiro Niwa, the Japanese ambassador to China, said the people of China and Japan should learn more about the current situation in each other's country rather than get entangled in the past if they want to forge stronger relations. Calling attention to the survey results, the ambassador said sincere communication is needed if the relationship is to improve. The ties between the two countries were damaged when Chinese and Japanese vessels collided in September. The ties improved, though, when China offered to help Japan recover from the large earthquake that struck in March. ""These events give us more reason for our two countries to work for friendship... This is the right time to strengthen our ties with action and determination,"" Niwa said. The survey, conducted annually prior to the Beijing-Tokyo Forum, found that people's attitudes in China and Japan have changed largely because of the history of Japan's aggression in China and because of territorial disputes over the Diaoyu Islands in the East China Sea. Before returning to Beijing late on Saturday to attend the forum's opening ceremony on Sunday, Niwa had just wound up a four-day visit to the Tibet autonomous region. In Tibet, he met with the Tibetan chairman, toured Buddhist temples and talked with ordinary people. He said the trip was aimed at getting to know the ethnic groups in China better.  According to the Japanese embassy in Beijing, Niwa is the first Japanese ambassador to visit Tibet in at least 10 years. In the year since he took office, Niwa has traveled to several places in China, including Nanjing, where many citizens were slaughtered by invading Japanese troops during 1937 and 1945. ""I am trying to visit everywhere in China and hope to help more Chinese people understand Japan,"" Niwa said. ""I believe if I persevere for 10 years, the ties between Japan and China will surely improve,"" Niwa said. Niwa, a Japanese businessman with extensive experience in China, first came to China in the 1980s. Niwa became the ambassador to China in 2010 at the age of 71 and is the first Japanese civilian who was picked to be an ambassador after the war.  Calls for better ties with China also came from another incumbent Japanese cabinet member at the forum. Renho Murata, minister of administrative reform, said she and her colleagues will strive to ensure the ties between the countries are strengthened. The 42-year-old Murata is the first Japanese cabinet member with Chinese origins. Her father was a merchant from Taiwan and her mother was Japanese.  Renho studied Chinese for two years at Peking University and is now working to improve communications between China and Japan. Renho pledged that more Japanese people will visit China to gain a better understanding of it. Renho said it is important that people recognize that today there is a new China and a new Japan rather than getting stuck in the past."
0,"Chinese actor Ge You has won a lawsuit against a travel company that used his image without permission. The image used by the company was taken from the sitcom  and shows Ge lazing on a couch. The photograph has also become a Chinese Internet meme known as ""Ge You-esque slouching"" and is used by netizens to express their laziness. Beijing-based travel company eLong was found to use the photo and other Ge portraits for advertising a garment brand on a company social network account in July 2016, according to a statement by the Beijing Municipal First Intermediate People's Court on Saturday. The company mentioned Ge's name several times by saying ""Ge You-esque slouching"" in photo captions, according to the statement.,After a complaint by the actor, eLong deleted the photos in August 2016 and issued an open letter of apology in December of the same year. Ge believed the apology was another form of commercial promotion, and filed a lawsuit against the company at the Haidian District People's Court. In the first instance, the Haidian court ruled that eLong must pay compensation of 75,000 yuan ($11,842) and apologize to Ge for infringement of image rights. The municipal court accepted eLong's appeal in January, but ultimately backed the Haidian court ruling. Ge You is a household name in China. His films include ""If you are the one,"" ""Sacrifice"" and ""Be there or be square."""
0,"The 2019 World Transport Convention opened in Beijing on Friday to showcase the latest technical achievements in the transport industry. The convention from Thursday to Sunday is themed ""Green and Intelligent Mobility for Future Transport,"" and consists of a rich list of activities, including keynote speeches, exhibition, academic forums and competitions. Liu Xiaoming, vice-minister of transport, said at the opening ceremony that despite the achievements made in the expressway, waterway, high-speed railway and civil aviation, it is true that traffic accidents, traffic congestion, and air pollution still hamper the development of transportation. ""In the new era, China must focus on building a safe, convenient, efficient, green, and economical modern transportation system. To create a strong transportation network, we must put innovation in the core position,"" he said. More than 10 international transport organizations and 40 academicians from home and abroad are attending the convention, together with over 6,000 participants. They will cover topics including smart transportation, automatic drive, the Internet of Things and green travel. The convention will also highlight activities about cooperation among the Belt and Road countries. The convention was previously held in 2017 and 2018."

About 400 kilometers away from Beijing, Zhenglan Banner has a World Heritage site Xanadu, or Yuan Shangdu ruins. It was one of the two major capitals of the Yuan dynasty with the other in today's Beijing. ""To my surprise, camels are pretty handy for traversing the snow-covered grassland,"" said Kong Ziming, a visitor from Beijing. ""I often drive here in summer, but winter Naadam showed more traditional sports and custom of ethnic Mongolians."",This year's local winter Naadam fair kicked off on Saturday near Xanadu. During the fair, organizers hosted traditional sports events including camel racing, Mongolian wrestling and archery. The event also showcased ethnic Mongolians' traditional pastimes, including folk singing and dancing.

About 50 teachers in 35 schools in Beijing's southern district of Fengtai joined the week-long program, which was organized by the AIDS Prevention Education Project for Chinese Youth (APEPCY), a non-profit organization. ""Sex education is the key to AIDS prevention, as more and more young students are being infected due to lack of sexual knowledge,"" said Zhang Yinjun, the founder of APEPCY. According to a report released by Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2,321 new AIDS cases of students aged 15 to 24 were found from January to September 2016, 4.1 times more than the same period in 2010. Over 10 experts in AIDS prevention and control as well as in sex education carried out training courses, including on sexual development, sex education in foreign countries and AIDS prevention, which helped teachers design curriculums. ""There is a great demand for sex education as more sexual assault appeared among teenagers,"" said Xing Haiyan, secretary general of APEPCY. ""It is necessary for students to receive sexual health education at an early age."" APEPCY started training teachers on sex education in July 2017. The program will last for four years."

A ""food test in the throne room"" exposed a startling case on disasters that were hidden and money, which was embezzled by greedy officials, who cared only about achievements in their official careers, and a crisis ensued causing the Qing Dynasty to suffer from shrinkage of grain fields and the emptying of granaries. Several capable ministers including Liu Tongxun were entrusted on a mission to reclaim the wasteland and investigate the shortcomings of the century-old imperial fields. Nevertheless, corrupt officials led by Ne Qin had colluded with businessmen to launch a coordinated attack from both the courts and commonalty. : Feb 25 - 7:30 pm : NCPA, Beijing This program presents what we now know as Italian baroque music from the early 17th and 18th centuries.

1,"Soaring housing prices are driving people out of the country's first-tier cities – Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, a new survey shows.  The Social Survey Center of China Youth Daily recently surveyed 2,000 people, who were either currently or had previously worked or studied in first-tier cities about their plans. The survey found more than 70 percent had left or were planning to move away. About 23 percent of respondents had already left the first-tier cities and about 48 percent were planning to leave. Only 21.5 percent were not thinking about leaving, and 7.5 percent hadn't decided.  High house prices was named by 64 percent as their main reason for leaving, while high cost of living (46.9 percent), poor air environment, hard work, difficulty getting a hukou and traffic congestion were listed as other reasons. Feng Qian, who graduated from Peking University four years ago, now works at a bank in Shijiazhuang, capital of Hebei province. He said he left Beijing because of how difficult it is to get a hukou. If people left the first-tier cities, 46.7 percent said they would go to capital cities of provinces, regions or other municipalities. About a quarter would head to prefecture-level cities, while some preferred county towns. However, the survey also found that 32.4 percent of respondents who had left the first-tier cities had since returned. Zhai Bing, 28, who worked as a property salesperson in Shanghai for five years before returning to a county town in Henan province two years ago, is now back in Shanghai working for an online shop.  She said she could not bear the complicated relationships among people, the low income and boring life in her hometown. Another reason for her return was the poor relationship with her mother-in-law."
1,"Electric bicycles and tricycles on Beijing's roads face stricter regulation as authorities clamp down on substandard and dangerous products. Since mid-May, the Beijing Administration for Industry and Commerce has been investigating sales of products that do not conform to national standards. The authority will introduce new standards to retailers, remind them to stop selling products that don't meet requirements, and contact manufacturers in advance to make sure they meet standards. Starting from July, the authority will examine illegal sales behavior and revoke the business licenses of those who continue to sell products that fail to meet requirements, it said. It added that consumers should buy products that meet national standards. The regulations affect electric bicycles, tricycles, four-wheelers, and scooters for senior citizens. In 2015, there were more than 31,000 accidents in Beijing involving these types of vehicles, resulting in 113 deaths and more than 21,000 injuries, according to the figures provided by the Beijing Traffic Management Bureau. Many electric bicycles and tricycles on Beijing's roads are operated by express and food delivery workers. China is the world's biggest food delivery market. By the end of last year, about 1 million riders delivered more than 27 million orders every day for Ele.me, Baidu Waimai and Meituan Waimai, the country's three biggest online food delivery platforms, and nearly all the riders use electric bicycles or tricycles. Currently, there are more than 1,000 merchants selling electric cycles in Beijing, and about 4 million such vehicles are running on the streets of Beijing. Last year, the Beijing Administration for Industry and Commerce found 174 electric models that failed to meet requirements, and it has placed the sellers on file for investigation and their details have been published on the enterprise credit information website in Beijing. According to national policy, electric cycles need to get 3C authentication, meaning they must be audited by the certification bodies and can only be sold after meeting the requirements. YTO Express, a leading courier with 68,000 branches nationwide, has more than 3,000 electric tricycles for express delivery services in Beijing. ""In recent years, electric tricycles have become the preferred means of transportation for the fast delivery sector, given their flexibility, low-carbon discharge, and high cost performance. But for the fast delivery sector and enterprises, we need to keep the bottom line and ensure the safety of delivery workers at all development stages,"" YTO Express said in an email. The company said it has established a security supervision department at its headquarters in Shanghai, and it has security supervisors in other cities. The company has also launched regular and nonscheduled safety training and safety inspections. ""We educate delivery workers about road traffic regulations and fire safety, and we also check the condition of our electric tricycles to find out if there are problems such as aging circuits, worn tires and loose screws,"" the company said."
1,"BEIJING - Though repeating a lie creates the illusion of truth, yet myths, unlike the plain truth which is sustained by fact, can't stand the test of time. Washington has been adept at blaming other countries for its domestic woes and its recent trade offensive against China, to some extent, also falls into this category. The Trump administration claims that since China joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, the United States has lost more than 60,000 factories. However, a quick fact-check will show that the reality is something else. Statistics indicate that the decline in US manufacturing jobs is more of a domestic issue than due to trade with low-wage economies like China. According to US economist Philip Levy, irrespective of China's entry into the WTO, the share of manufacturing employment in total US nonfarm payrolls - the primary indicator used to assess US job creations - fell about 30 percent every 16 years. The China factor, instead of generating the decline, actually represents slowing of an existing trend. What's more, in a study on the impact of expanding Chinese imports on jobs, Yale University professor Lorenzo Caliendo said access to low-cost intermediate inputs from China has increased employment in non-manufacturing sectors, including retail, construction and services, to offset the job losses in manufacturing, resulting in a rise in welfare. A number of sobering facts explains what truly causes job losses. First, it is not Chinese workers that take away jobs from US workers. US firms are choosing to invest and set up factories in China, where the workforce is skilled and cheaper. Actually, US investors' foreign investments have risen dramatically since the 1990s, shifting low-value-added, labor-intensive industries to developing countries for low-cost assembly. Second, US factories don't need as many workers as they used to because robots are increasingly doing the work and the industry is becoming more productive and closer to markets. In fact, while trade accounted for about 12 percent of the lost US factory jobs, 88 percent of the jobs were taken over by robots and other factors at home. Moreover, there is no downturn in US manufacturing output. Rather, investment in automation and software has doubled the output per US manufacturing worker over the past two decades. Last but not the least, the two largest economies in the world are interdependent and more than bilateral trade partners. According to the US Department of Commerce, US exports of goods and services to China supported an estimated 910,000 jobs in 2015 - 601,000 were supported by goods exports and 309,000 by service exports. For years, the United States has enjoyed service trade surplus with China. The surplus recorded $38 billion in 2016, 11.6 percent more than in 2015 and up 908 percent from 2001. More importantly, when looking at the overall US trade deficit, the proportion of US trade deficit with China is on the decrease year by year. The United States' claim that its trade deficit with China is widening is based on questionable algorithms. No one can deny that the majority of the profits goes into the US pocket. It's primitive for the US government to tackle trade disputes by wielding the trade protectionism stick. The drop in US manufacturing employment should not be the only indicator to gauge the balance of benefits from the economic relationship with China, nor should it overshadow the sizable benefits of the trade to the American economy and the potential of fresh trade gains. Any trade war will affect millions of workers in hundreds of real and varied places, and ultimately produce unexpected ramifications for local communities in the United States. Targeting China will only divert energy from the real challenge and put the future of the US economy at risk."
0,"The choir - with 40 members, aged from 11 to 15, from Beijing's primary and middle schools - beat 14 other teams from around the world to win the prize. As the only children's choir in the contest, the singers took part in six events in the three-day contest. The event, organized by the International Federation For Choral Music, is one of the six major European choral competitions in the EGP (European Grand Prix for Choral Singing) league. The other five are held in Hungary, Slovenia, Spain, France and Bulgaria. A choir which wins the top prize in any of the six choral contests will be eligible for the next year's EGP grand competition. The Beijing Philharmonic choir was founded in 1983 by Yang Hongnian, a professor at the Central Conservatory of Music. Over its 30 years of development it has trained nearly 5,000 Chinese children who love music and has performed thousands of songs for audiences all over the world. At the latest competition, Yang received a special gift from a member of the organizing committee. The Italian, at his 50s, said he had watched a performance by the choir 21 years ago. He made a photo album, with a handwritten message in Italian and Chinese on the cover, showing his respect for Yang. ""This is the real proof of China's soft power,"" Yang said."
1,"Beijing housing authorities have intensified a crackdown on irregularities in the housing market in a bid to cool the overheated rental market. In a statement released on its website last week, the Beijing Municipal Commission of Housing and Urban-Rural Development said it is coordinating with 10 other major departments in Beijing to regulate the market. The special operation, which started in July, will last until December. Since the beginning of the year, a special group led by the Beijing housing authorities, the city’s banking regulator and its finance and tax bureaus has strengthened a clampdown on market irregularities that have fueled increases in housing prices. Speculative activities that have been targeted include the monopolizing of housing resources to manipulate rents. The statement said the crackdown will also focus on misleading information from housing agencies."
0,"Clouds of dust swirl in the air as innumerable wildebeests throw themselves into the Mara River as they try to cross its surging waters without falling prey to crocodiles lurking under its surface. This is just one scene from the vast herds of the grazing antelopes' annual migration from the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania to the greener pastures of the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya. ""It's spectacular! My excitement is beyond words. It feels different to be here in person rather than to watch it in a documentary,"" says Beijinger Hou Yunsong, 14, who traveled to Kenya with his mother, Hou Jing, in August. Their trip was combined with a natural-science-education program, which saw Chinese zookeeper Yang Yi on hand to introduce animals' habits and characteristics on safari. Beijing-based company Nature Culture began organizing these trips three years ago to give parents and kids the chance to visit destinations rich in biodiversity, such as Sri Lanka and Malaysia, to observe wildlife. Experts like Yang, who often promote natural-science education, act as guides.,""It's a good opportunity for parents and children to study together and develop their relationship. Many parents also enjoy nature, and these experiences help to recall their own fond childhood memories,"" says wildlife photographer Zheng Yang, co-founder of the company. ""They will also be moved by the interaction between the animals, such as the bonds between mothers and offspring, and prompted to think about their own family relations."" Zheng believes that his company provides a unique travel experience and that it's more effective to teach kids on-site knowledge about animals, because it makes it more likely children will remember what they learn. While most children tend to be interested in primates, amphibians and large animals such as lions, leopards and hippopotamuses, only a few prefer wild birds, Yang says. Before a trip, the company will provide training programs about safety, local customs and traditions, and local biodiversity. After every trip, the experts will help children share their feelings in a presentation to an audience made up of parents. ""It's a selective lifestyle program, not a mainstream one. Only those who really enjoy it will persist. We have many regular customers,"" Zheng says.,""Unlike typical travel products, our trips are not uniform and our guides are experts in their fields, such as zoology. You never know what animal you may encounter until it happens, so each experience is different."" Their peak time is summer and winter vacations, and the children taking part are 6 to 12 years old. The company also organizes short trips to museums in China and provides children with courses taught by experts about nature and wildlife. Other companies have begun to set up travel packages around the theme of natural science, having noticed the family-travel market's potential. But there is still little in the way of regulation in this emerging sector. ""The more I learn about nature, the more I like it,"" Yunsong says. ""When I'm in the wilderness, I feel like I'm part of the Earth. It's good to know that there will always be this natural paradise that can comfort your heart."",Yunsong started to learn photography from Zheng two years ago with a digital single-lens reflex camera. ""I enjoy the process of taking photos. I like to hear the sound of shutter clicks. I'm blissfully happy when I capture a good picture,"" says Yunsong. ""Whenever I see a photo, I will recall the moment when I took it. ""I like taking pictures of wild animals because I like the uncertainty. You never know what will happen the next second."" Zheng says each time they observe a wild animal, the only sounds they hear is the click of shutters. He teaches the parents and children how to take the best photos possible, and he believes photography is a great vehicle for communication. For the experts, these trips offer the opportunity to learn about nature education in other countries, and they often return home with illustrated handbooks of the wildlife they have encountered abroad. They enjoy guiding tourists because they want to pass on their knowledge, and they also relish the chance to encounter animals in the wild.,They become excited when they come across rare species. When they caught sight of a critically endangered helmeted hornbill in Malaysia, one of the locals said that it was only the third time he had seen the bird over the past 15 years. ""People used to kill the bird for its casque, which is a precious ornamental material. Someone may think it's just a bird, but you will be touched when you know the story behind it,"" Zheng says. ""This kind of connection between human beings and animals is not uncommon during our travels."" Yang once raised a baby chimpanzee for three years before it was sent on to another zoo in 2003. It so happened that when he guided a group of tourists around Shanghai Zoo last year, the chimpanzee recognized him through glass－and greeted him by moving back and forth. ""If an animal was once raised by me and then sent away, I rarely see them again to avoid recalling old memories,"" Yang says. ""I was very happy and surprised that he still remembered me. When I left, he still followed me with his eyes."",""These trips are like opening a door for us to a colorful world. My son and I have learned how to observe the environment surrounding us,"" says Hou Jing, 43, a university lecturer. ""When you learn about the habits and characteristics of an animal, you realize that human beings are not superior at all."" More importantly, she believes that the children on these trips learn a lot about benevolence and love. They don't hurt animals or plants and will also stop others from doing so, such as people who try to pick flowers in botanical gardens. Zhang Ying, 40, gradually fell in love with nature and wildlife after joining several of these trips with her 9-year-old son, Fang Jinpeng. ""My generation didn't have much chance to learn about nature in a scientific way. I didn't even know what I wanted to do when I was a high school student, but my son already knows what he likes, even at such a young age,"" Zhang says. She's glad that they will both be able to develop scientific knowledge about nature and have more to talk about. The company worked with the Fragrant Hills Park in Beijing to organize camping activities and guide parents and kids to observe amphibians and insects at night. That's how her son started to learn about wildlife. A teacher would return an insect back to exactly the same spot on a leaf after presenting it to the parents and children.,""Teachers are passionate about their profession and children like them,"" Zhang says. ""My son admires scientists after learning about their work. Each time he goes to the Beijing Museum of Natural History, he will bow to photos of the curator and former curator."" Through his own efforts, Jinpeng successfully passed the test to allow him to work in his free time as a guide at both the National Museum of China and the Beijing Museum of Natural History. The boy believes he has a responsibility to tell others about the importance of animal and plant protection. He stops other children who want to see animal performances or feed animals in a zoo and tells them it harms the creatures. ""The most important thing is to protect the habitats of wildlife,"" Jinpeng says. ""If you don't know about the creatures, you can hardly know how to protect them."" Jinpeng often reads books and watches documentaries to further his knowledge about wildlife. ""A tiger will not hunt 10 rabbits, eat only one and waste the rest,"" Jinpeng says. ""As human beings, we should not waste food."",Zheng often says on the trips: ""Safety always comes first in the wilderness."" Nature reserve staff members protect groups and help them find their way. Travelers have to fasten their safety belts in the safari vehicles and are never allowed to put their bodies or arms out of the windows. If an elephant is crossing the road, they are instructed to keep quiet. ""Also, you should never make contact with mammals, especially primates, in the wilderness so as to prevent the risk of the transmission of zoonoses,"" he says. He emphasizes that visitors should never take living creatures, plant seeds or illegal wildlife products back to China. Liu Simin, vice-president of tourism at the Beijing-based Chinese Society for Future Studies, says: ""This kind of travel can not only broaden children's horizons, but also teach them about natural science. However, it takes time for the market to grow. ""That said, discovering beautiful natural scenery remains the priority for ordinary tourists, and anyone can enjoy these kinds of experiences with their families. In natural-science travel, parents have to focus their energies on studying the subject in detail, but some parents may not be willing to do so."" Liu says that tailored family-travel packages emphasize the need for interaction, and are likely to continue to grow in popularity."

The two centers, in the city's Shijingshan and Tongzhou districts, accept applications for residence permits, permanent residence permits, and the issuance and replacement of foreigners' permanent resident identity cards. Foreigners can also apply for different types of residence permits, including those related to work, study, family and personal affairs. Those who have made special contributions to China, have investments and employment in China, and those who have family in China can apply for permanent residence. Qualified foreign applicants in Beijing can apply for services at the two centers without regional restrictions. Before applying for a residence permit, applicants need to log into the ""Online Beijing Public Security Bureau"" website to schedule an appointment in the ""Exit and Entry Management"" section and print out the application form. Then, they need to submit the form at the appointed time and place with other required documents. Those who apply for the residence permit service online can receive their permits after seven working days. Beijing now has six foreigner exit-entry service centers offering visa and certificate services. The other four are in the city's Dongcheng, Chaoyang, Haidian and Shunyi districts.

0,"Boarding schools in Beijing will be banned from selling soda drinks in cafeterias and stores inside campuses this year, part of an effort to encourage students to eat healthy food, the city's health authority said.  The Beijing Municipal Commission of Health and Family Planning said on Wednesday that it will launch a campaign to establish ""health cafeterias"" in all schools to improve students' nutritional balance.  ""Problems such as obesity have haunted parents and children, and the solution starts with controlling what they eat,"" said Du Hong, deputy head of disease control at the commission.  Pilot healthy cafeterias have been established in 59 schools. The program will be rolled out to all schools within this year.  Under a city regulation, boarding schools must ""strictly control food high in fat, salt and sugar, including burgers and instant noodles, and must ban unhealthy beverages such as soda"".  Schools should offer food safety and nutrition education classes each semester, as well as provide students' health information to parents on a regular basis, the regulation said.  Each school cafeteria should have one full-time or part-time nutritionist to make suggestions for the menu. And a weekly menu should be posted in notable places, along with nutritional information.  Also under the regulation, alternative menus will be recommended to students with various health conditions.  According to a survey of all Beijing schools by the city health commission, students eat too much meat and salt, and lack sufficient healthy food, including vegetables, fruit and milk. About 20 percent of students in primary, middle and high schools in Beijing are overweight.  Among the obese children, about 30 percent have high blood sugar and fat.  This year, the city's health department will revise health guidance for students, and will conduct another nutrition and health survey of students in Beijing's seven districts.  The survey is expected to find out the main reasons for nutritional imbalance among students by assessing their knowledge, attitudes and assumptions about food, as well as noting their nutritional intake and other factors.  A strategy is expected to be devised based on the survey's findings."

""As of now, government officials of the two countries have never engaged in any negotiations concerning the trade friction,"" said Gao Feng, spokesman of the Ministry of Commerce. ""Principles must be followed before negotiations get started. However, the US has not shown any sincerity to negotiate,"" Gao said. ""Whether the two sides can negotiate under the WTO framework will depend on whether the US side still respects the WTO and whether it still respects multilateral rules,"" Gao said at a press conference. ""If the United States clings obstinately to its own course and insists on unilateralism and trade protectionism, China will fight resolutely till the very end,"" the spokesman warned. Gao noted China's continued opening-up measures have nothing to do with the ongoing trade friction with the United States. The major strategic decisions are made based on an accurate estimation of the country's current development level, in order to elevate opening-up in the new era to a higher level, Gao said."
1,"Beijing Sinnet Technology Co Ltd, Amazon's Chinese partner, announced that it will buy specific assets related to cloud services, including serversand IT equipment, for up to 2 billion yuan ($301.2 million) from Amazon. Sinnet said in a filing on Monday that the move aims to codmply with China's rules and  and further improve the security and the service quality of the Amazon Web Services' cloud service. ""Chinese law forbids non-Chinese companies from owning or operating certain technology for the provision of cloud services,"" an AWS spokesman told chinadaily.com.cn. ""As a result, in order to comply with Chinese law, AWS sold certain physical infrastructure assets to Sinnet,"" the spokesman said, adding AWS would continue to own the intellectual property for AWS Services worldwide. ? AWS did not sell its business in China and remains fully committed to ensuring Chinese customers continue to receive AWS's industry leading cloud services, the spokesman added.  Taking information security into consideration, all foreign companies must partner with domestic enterprise with IDC licenses to operate cloud services.  In July, 2016, Sinnet obtained AWS authorization and became the service operator and provider for AWS China (Beijing) region using AWS cloud technologies required to support AWS information technology services in China. However, Sinnet has not won operating licenses so far. In January, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said cloud service operators without a license cannot continue their business from January 1, 2018.  The deal will remove obstacles for Sinnet to get such licenses, the Wall Street Journal said quoting analysts from Citic Securities Tuesday. AWS is a global leading cloud computing services provider. However, in China, local cloud enterprises perform well.

0,"China's dance scene mourns performing arts pioneer, Li Chengxiang, who passed away last week. Tributes have been pouring in for Li Chengxiang, a renowned Chinese dancer-choreographer, who died at the age of 87 on Dec 14 after a long illness. According to the National Ballet of China, which was headed by Li from 1984 to 1994, he was diagnosed with cancer in 2002, but his health condition worsened over the past two years. On Dec 17, Chinese ballet dancers, former colleagues and friends of Li gathered at the National Ballet of China in Beijing to mourn his passing. Ballet in China has a nearly 60-year history. Li was among the first group of Chinese ballet dancers who received training from Russian experts in the 1950s. In 1957, Li became the assistant teacher of the Beijing Dance School when Russian dancer and choreographer Pyotr Gusev was the school's artistic director. With the founding of the National Ballet of China in 1959, Li played in the first three classic ballet productions adapted by the troupe: Swan Lake, Le Corsaire (The Pirate) and Giselle. Of all his choreographic works, the best known is Red Detachment of Women, China's first original ballet production, which premiered in the capital in 1964 and in which, Li played the ruthless landlord Nan Batian. It is perhaps best known in the West as the ballet performed for former US president Richard Nixon during his visit to China in 1972.,Based on a 1961 film of the same name, which was directed by Xie Jin, it tells the story of a rural girl, Wu Qionghua, who escapes a life of slavery and joins an all-female Communist Party army battalion led by commander Hong Changqing on Hainan Island during the civil war in the early 1930s. To better understand and portray the female soldiers, Li led the composer Wu Zuqiang, choreographers Jiang Zuhui and Wang Xixian, as well as ballet dancers Bai Shuxiang, Zhong Runliang and Liu Qingtang on a trip to Hainan. ""The dancers took off their ballet shoes and put on army boots. They received strict training just like soldiers,"" says Feng Ying, a veteran ballet dancer and the director of the National Ballet of China, who has also performed the leading female role of Wu Qionghua. ""Li also incorporated the moves of Peking Opera into his choreography, which was pioneering,"" adds Zhao Ruheng, renowned ballet dancer and former director of the National Ballet of China, who took the position after Li's 10-year tenure ended in 1994.,""Li had made great contribution to the development of Chinese ballet. He also shared his vision about art playing an important role in the life of people. The missions of developing Chinese ballet and training homegrown ballet dancers had always been on his mind."" Feng says that Red Detachment of Women is still evolving since a new generation of ballet dancers perform the piece every year. ""We are proud that the ballet piece not only appeals to audiences in China, but is also well-received when we tour abroad,"" Feng says. ""It portrays Chinese women in powerful roles that broke with the traditional image of weak women of the time. The spirit of the story is shared by women worldwide. It's the best example of telling a Chinese story through a Western art form."" Li, who was born in Harbin, Northeast China's Heilongjiang province, graduated from North China University, the predecessor of Renmin University of China, with a major in theater. He started working with the Central Academy of Drama as a dancer in 1954 and, that same year, he was enrolled to study ballet at the Beijing Dance School and started choreographing his original dance pieces.,Established dancer Chen Ailian began studying traditional Chinese dance in Beijing in 1952. She met Li for the first time at Beijing Dance School in 1954 when Li invited her to dance in his choreographic work, Shepherdess. ""It was the first time that I learned Tibetan dance moves and Li was inspiring to me,"" recalls Chen, 79, who was born in Shanghai and grew up in an orphanage. In 1959, under the instruction and direction of Russian experts, Yu Mei Ren (The Beautiful Mermaid) premiered in Beijing－it was the first Chinese dance drama to combine Western ballet with traditional Chinese dance moves. Li was one of the choreographers and Chen played the leading role. ""Few Chinese choreographers combined ballet and traditional Chinese dance as well as Li did then. He understood the language of the two dance forms,"" Chen says."

The first 1,300-meter overhead wire for the railway is now being set up, and smart devices will be enabled throughout the power supply system to ensure operational safety, China Railway Corporation said on Monday. The new line-an important project for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic Games-will be the world's first intelligent, high-speed railway on which automatically operated trains reach speeds of 350 km/h, the corporation said. The automatic operation of bullet trains in coordination with the Beidou Navigation Satellite System-the first time it has been applied to trains-was tested on a section of the Beijing-Shenyang line from July to September and passed all safety tests. Using the system, the train can automatically start, run between stations, adjust its timing according to the schedule, accurately stop at a station, and open and close its doors, said Jiang Ming, deputy chief engineer of China Railway Signal and Communication Corporation. The train is equipped with several thousand sensors, which allow automatic inspection at any time to ensure safe operation. The train is also designed with an area to store snowboards, a device to secure wheelchairs and a mobile news center where passengers can watch live Olympic broadcasts. A variety of intelligent robots will also be used at high-speed rail stations to guide passengers and help them carry their baggage, China Railway Corporation added. The laying of track for the railway is expected to be completed in the first half of this year, and trial operations and adjustments to the line will be launched in the second half. After the 174-kilometer line goes into operation by the end of this year, the trip between the two cities will be shortened to 50 minutes, from three hours or more at present. The line will also connect with the Zhangjiakou-Hohhot high-speed railway, cutting travel time from Hohhot, Inner Mongolia autonomous region, to Beijing to three hours, down from nine."

0,"Beijing's environmental watchdog has vowed to further improve air quality in the capital this year. The city will strive to decrease its annual PM2.5 concentration, as well as its average three-year density of airborne particles, by focusing efforts on three major pollution culprits－diesel-powered trucks, kicked-up dust and volatile organic compounds－the Beijing Ecological Environment Bureau said on Tuesday. It said greater efforts will be made to improve air quality through better, more detailed management of pollution sources in what it's calling the 1 Microgram Campaign, which underscores the increasing difficulty of reducing PM2.5 density by even a single microgram. The three-year average metric was introduced to help reduce the skewing of data due to meteorological conditions and show how the public's efforts contribute to overall improvements, the bureau said. The plan was announced as Beijing saw its PM2.5 density drop by about 12 percent year-on-year to 51 micrograms per cubic meter last year－5 mcg/cu m lower than the target set in the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-20). In January, however, the density increased almost 53 percent year-on-year to 52 mcg/cu m. The authorities have yet to explain the increase. To move the 1 Microgram Campaign forward, Beijing authorities will speed up restrictions on diesel-powered trucks and eventually phase out obsolete ones. An online monitoring system for heavy-duty trucks will be accelerated, under the plan, which also said that all construction sites will be equipped with video monitoring systems to help the city control airborne dust. Mobile sources contributed 45 percent of locally generated PM2.5 in Beijing, with diesel trucks the top culprit. Kicked-up dust came in second at 16 percent, according to the bureau's analysis of pollution sources in 2018. Officials have stressed that it will be increasingly difficult for Beijing to further improve its air quality, especially since the capital has already rolled out all major measures capable of achieving quick results. This includes, for example, the shift from coal to clean energy for heating. Liu Bingjiang, head of air quality management at the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, told a news conference last month that ""it will be the biggest victory for Beijing if it could safeguard the PM2.5 density of 51 mcg/cu m"" this year. He also warned of the possibility that the density will increase if unfavorable meteorological conditions are in play. The ministry said average PM2.5 density from October to January in the 28 major cities in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei province cluster increased by 6.7 percent year-on-year to 80 mcg/cu m. Despite the increase in January, the PM2.5 concentration in Beijing during the period was still the lowest in the cluster. It added that, compared with last year, meteorological conditions in the cluster will be less favorable for pollutant dispersal this month and in March, though conditions are close to the 10-year average. Moderate to heavy air pollution will settle into the cluster and the Fenhe and Weihe plains, mostly in Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces, from Wednesday to Sunday because of unfavorable meteorological conditions, the setting off fireworks for Lantern Festival on Tuesday, and resumption of industrial activities after the Spring Festival holiday break, it said."

The lab, called Chinese Sports Big Data and Blockchain Technology Laboratory, was jointly launched by Beijing Institute of Big Data Research, ZhongShiLiangZhong (Beijing) Cultural Media Co Ltd and Xinda Rong Chuang (Beijing) Management Consulting Co Ltd. It aims at utilizing big data and blockchain technology to promote the transformation and upgrading of the sports industry, and better serve the public. Wen Zaiwen, director of the laboratory, said ""Just like big data can instruct artificial intelligence program AlphaGo to compete against human, it can also guide the player assignment for a soccer match, or how a ticket office sells tennis tickets. Big data and blockchain technology can bring actual benefits to the sports industry."" Specifically, the lab will collect, organize and analyze valuable data around the entire industrial chain related to sports, to empower the sports and health industry. Furthermore, it will increase the efficiency in the industry, as well as guide and boost consumption in the field. Using the strong human resources of Beijing Institute of Big Data Research, the lab will actively promote the coordinated development of technology and sports industry. An expert think tank in the field of sports, big data and blockchain will be established, so that a team of experts are able to provide technical consulting and decision-making support to the government, research institutions, enterprises and other professionals in the field. At the meantime, the lab will promote the integration of production, teaching and research, where scientific and technological results and related products come out. ""Sports penetrate into every aspects of our life, including sports education, competitive sports, physical exercise, cultural entertainment and healthcare. In 2016, the General Administration of Sport issued a guideline that during the 13th Five Year Plan period (2016-20), the nation should combine sports with internet, to bring about intelligent sports. I hope big data and blockchain technology can actually serve the development of sports industry,"" said Cai Hongyu, deputy director of Beijing Institute of Big Data Research. Li Yiliang, director with the Countywide Internet Finance Working Committee, said that ""The blockchain technology stores and verifies data, and guarantees the security of data transfer and access. Currently, the research and application of the technology have marched into a new level, and the technology will bring earthshaking changes to many industries. For the sports industry, adopting the blockchain technology is a demand to adapt to the era of development."""

According to its president, Song Yan, the Beijing Fenglei Peking Opera Company performed the piece back in 1990, with Peking Opera veteran Zhang Baohua, who died last year, in the lead role. ""  is rarely performed nowadays, but we want to pay tribute to the late actor Zhang Bohua, who was also my teacher, with this new production,"" says Song. Adapted from a Qing dynasty (1644-1911) novel,  the opera is compared to ""crime thriller"" by Song. ""It's about a policeman solving a very difficult case and the criminal is a good friend of the policeman,"" he explains. ""It's a very interesting story and we adapted it into a contemporary format, which caters to a younger audience."" Formerly known as Min Le She, The 80-year-old company was founded by its first president, Zhang Qi, and Peking Opera actor, Liang Yiming. It was renamed the Fenglei Peking Opera Company in 1971. When Song accepted the position of president in 2001, the company was in dire straits and facing extinction due to dwindling interest in the art form. Now, the company has not only survived, but has thrived, becoming one of the more widely recognized troupes in the country and staging around 600 shows a year. It has also toured more than 20 countries, such as Australia, Japan, Spain and the United States and has even staged an original composition, a dramatic tragedy entitled Wang Zi, that has since been performed nearly 50 times across China."
1,"China will work to refine the legal support system of the Belt and Road to enable better settlement of disputes and foster a business environment governed by the rule of law, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Monday. A dispute settlement mechanism featuring lawsuits, arbitration and mediation will be established at an early date, Wang said at the opening of the Forum on Belt and Road Legal Cooperation in Beijing. A security network of treaties should be established to fit into the development of the Belt and Road, with efforts made to fill blank areas and update relevant treaties, he said. ""Regulations and the rule of law provide the green light for the Belt and Road to go global, as well as the safety valve to cope with different types of uncertain risks and challenges,"" he said. China has always respected international law as well as national laws in its cooperation with different nations. The country is expediting the signing of agreements in trade, investment, finance, taxation, intellectual property rights, transportation and environmental protection with different nations to develop a Belt and Road network of regulations and the rule of law, he said. An information sharing and big data service platform on legal issues involving the Belt and Road will be established to enable better legal consultation services. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is working on a national treaty database to improve access to the information, he said. Beijing has decided to fund a research and study program for Belt and Road legal cooperation to further exchanges and cooperation, Wang said. He said that five years since it was proposed by President Xi Jinping in 2013, the Belt and Road Initiative has seen very fruitful early outcomes. China has signed cooperative agreements with close to 90 countries and international organizations on jointly building the Belt and Road, Wang said. China's investment in the involved countries has exceeded $70 billion, with more than 200,000 jobs created, he added. ""There are only win-win or multiwin outcomes, rather than sole beneficiaries,"" he said. Liu Zhenmin, under-secretary-general for economic and social affairs at the United Nations, said the initiative could be an opportunity to further harmonize legal systems related to foreign investment treatment and dispute settlements, strengthening multilateral systems and boosting implementation of Article 33 of the UN Charter on the dispute settlement. Douglas Flint, the UK Treasury's Belt and Road envoy, said that clarity and legal certainty will be crucial components for Belt and Road projects to promote the flow of international capital. Belt and Road projects are becoming increasingly multinational, thus providing requirements for contract frameworks that are widely accepted, clear and flexible, he said."
0,"YUSHU, Qinghai Province -- Nine years after a catastrophic earthquake battered Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, which killed thousands of people, new schools, hospitals and squares have mushroomed out of debris, and the locals are rebuilding their new life. Lodru Gyatso, 16, lost his father in the magnitude-7.1 quake, which hit Yushu in northwest China's Qinghai province on April 14, 2010 and left around 3,000 people dead or missing. ""I was reading books in school when the quake struck,"" he said. ""When I got back home, my brother told me our dad had been buried under the toppled house."" Lodru Gyatso's mother passed away when he was young. He was admitted to a local orphan school after the quake. The school is now home to more than 460 students, many of whom lost their parents in the disaster. ""After the earthquake, we have received many donations, which help to improve our infrastructure,"" said Nyima Rigzin, headmaster of the school. The school, humble with one-storey temporary houses, now has a classroom building, dormitory building, canteen and library. Lodru Gyatso likes to make robots in the classroom equipped with a 3D-printer. For 23-year-old Dawa Tsedin, takeout delivery is a bit boring. But it allows him to enjoy the beauty of Yushu's new cityscape, which has sprung up from a remote, backward town to a modern city over the past nine years. Dawa Tsedin chose to be a take-away food delivery man in Yushu after graduating from a vocational school in Xi'an, capital of neighboring Shaanxi Province. He said he returned because he had seen great potential in takeout delivery in the city. ""In the past, I couldn't believe that takeout delivery was available in Yushu,"" he said. ""Now as I pass by the landmarks such as the Gesar Square, I really feel that Yushu looks like a big city."" New buildings with Tibetan characteristics, new business quarters and broad avenues have sprung up in the city, in sharp contrast to the scenes before the quake. Cai Chengyong, the city's Party chief, said Yushu has also been improving urban management and building a smart city with advanced technologies. To date, the city has invested over six million yuan (about $895,000) to build an intelligent urban management network covering all streets and communities. During reconstruction, Beijing has lent a hand, investing heavily in infrastructure construction and bringing talent of education, medicine, city planning and urban management. Pei Zhifei, a veteran gynecologist from a hospital in Beijing, has been working in the Yushu Prefectural People's Hospital since 2017, tutoring local doctors in complex surgeries. ""Now many critically ill patients get treated in Yushu,"" said Pei. ""And many patients from Sichuan and Tibet have come to our hospital seeking medical help."" Official data show 163 experts from Beijing, including teachers and doctors, have worked in Yushu to assist the reconstruction. In recent years, Yushu has received a growing number of tourists from home and abroad as it has listed tourism as a pillar industry. Ashak Yumpon, director of Yushu prefecture tourism bureau, said the prefecture, home to the Hol Xil Nature Reserve and the headwaters of the Yangtze, Yellow and Lancang (Mekong) rivers, boasts abundant tourism resources. ""We will promote sustainable development of the tourism industry and build ourselves into an international tourism destination,"" he said."
1,"The retreat from a potential trade war between China and the United States is beneficial for both countries and global economic development, said China’s Ambassador to the UK Liu Xiaoming in London on Monday. Liu was addressing more than 100 representatives from the business, politics and academic sectors at the London-based think tank Asia House. “For China, this outcome is in the interest of achieving high quality economic development, and meeting the growing consumption needs of the Chinese people. For the US, this outcome will cut trade deficit, support growth and employment,” he said. His remarks came after two days of “positive, pragmatic, constructive and fruitful” talks in Washington between the Chinese and US government representatives, led by China’s Vice-Premier Liu He, and US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, which concluded on Friday. In a joint statement on Saturday, the two countries agreed to take measures to reduce the US trade deficit in goods, with China significantly increasing purchases of US goods and services, which will help support growth and employment in the US. These agreements put a stop to the previously threatened trade war, which began earlier this year with US President Donald Trump threatening to impose tariffs on up to $150 billion on Chinese goods, and China threatening equal retaliation. Central to the bilateral tension is the existence of US’s $335 billion annual trade deficit with Beijing. Trump has also previously accused China of infringing US intellectual property, such as technology and copyright. Liu said that while the dangers of a trade war have abated for now, the events of the past few months deserve deeper reflection. He gave China’s trading partners several suggestions for the development of win-win trade relations, for future consideration. Firstly, Liu said it is important to stop being suspicious about China and see the country’s development in an objective way. In particular, he stressed that China is still a developing country with its own problems and challenges. However, it is committed to pressing ahead with reform and opening up, processes that will provide many opportunities for its partners internationally. This year marks the 40th anniversary of China’s reform and opening up, which began in 1978. In the four decades since then, China has become the world's second-largest economy and the largest contributor to world growth. “China will continue to open up. As soon as major measures are being implemented, this will bring more opportunities with the world,” Liu said. Elsewhere in his speech, Liu stressed the importance of deepening the results of win-win collaboration, urging the US to treat Chinese products equally and fairly so that both countries can exercise their respective strengths to achieve mutual benefits. He also stressed the importance of following international rules rather than domestic laws in international trade, and urged the international community to recognize China’s real progress in intellectual property protection over the years."
0,"Next month's annual sessions of China's top legislature and political advisory body in Beijing appear set to lay solid foundations, in, at least, establishing guideline thoughts, strengthening the Party' s leadership and rationalizing the institutional arrangement for national rejuvenation by adopting a series of constitutional amendments and a structural reform plan to revamp the Party and the State institutions. The Communist Party of China Central Committee published its proposals to revise the Constitution on Sunday. Among the amendments, made necessary by the rapid growth beginning in 2004, when the Constitution was last amended, are the Party's key innovations in theories and practices since then —especially Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era— and a new national supervisory commission. Zhang Dejiang, chairman of the 12th National People's Congress Standing Committee, said in the last session of the committee in Beijing on Saturday that the March session of the NPC, the top legislature, which will elect the 13th NPC Standing Committee, will be of great significance to the implementation of new era thought and the spirit of the 19th CPC National Congress, according to Xinhua News Agency. ""It is also vital for realizing targets set by the CPC Central Committee. … We should ensure a successful beginning and fruitful outcome of the first session of the 13th NPC,"" Zhang said. Peng Xinlin, a researcher of law at Beijing Normal University, said the proposals for amending the Constitution are an inevitable requirement for advancing the cause of the Party and the State. That will win it the cordial support of the people, he said. ""The suggested changes are in line with the national condition, ensuring that the Constitution advances with the times. They keep the basic law's continuity and stability and bring about big development,"" Peng said. New era thought connects socialism with Chinese characteristics with modernization and national rejuvenationand answers a series of key issues on how to develop China in the new era, said Mo Jihong, deputy director of the Institute of Law at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. ""Writing Xi Jinping Thought into the Constitution will enhance the basic law's authority and let it play a big role in social development,"" Mo said. Experts say adding new era thought, which is the guideline for all causes of the national construction, to the Constitution is vitally important to strengthening the Party's leadership, uniting the people and keeping the nation developing in the right direction, forming a powerful deterrent to the hostile forces. Adhering to the Party's leadership and correct political direction is a principle of the proposed amendments, said Jiang Bo, vice president of Tongji University in Shanghai. ""Amending the Constitution concerns the basic interests of the nation and the future of the rule of law. Only by adhering to the Party's leadership while amending and applying the Constitution can we ensure that the nature of the country and development of rule of law remain unchanged,"" Jiang said. Liu He, a member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau, said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last month that China will mete out a series of new reform and opening-up measures this year, the 40th anniversary of its adopting the strategy. Some of these reform measures will be ""beyond the expectations of the international community"". The long-awaited revamping of State institutions — a central topic of the ongoing third plenary session of the 19th CPC Central Committee, and one that will be high on the agenda of the March session of the NPC — represents China's new efforts in that direction. It is believed that the restructuring can effectively improve State governance and make the system efficient, especially in taking on challenges in ecological preservation, financial reform and resolution of social issues. Also, the draft Supervision Law that is expected to be adopted at the NPC session, will define the responsibilities of the national supervisory commission, which will be directly under the Party's leadership, and will empower it to exercise relevant investigation rights and measures independently. The new law will strengthen the Party's leadership in fighting corruption of any public power holders, said Ma Huaide, vice-president of the China University of Political Science and Law in Beijing. ""It will stitch together the current divided antigraft efforts of the watchdogs for the Party, the government and the other public institutes, unifying the efforts of deepening reforms, govern the country by law and rule the Party by law,"" Ma said."

The Xiongan university should be directly under the administration of the Ministry of Education and recruit the president, management and teaching staff from around the world, Gao proposed. Compared with neighboring Beijing and Tianjin, Hebei is in shortage of high-quality first-class universities. According to Wu Yiqing, vice president of Hebei University of Economics and Business, Hebei only has one university that's listed in China's 211 or 985 key university national projects, while Beijing and Tianjin together have 38. And the only one — Hebei University of Technology — is located in Tianjin. To make up for the weakness in higher education, Gao proposed founding Xiongan University and developing it with high standards and goals. He also suggested listing one or two more universities in Hebei as national key universities, which can enjoy support from policies like China's ""Double Top"" universities. The ""Double Top"" plan was launched last year, with the aim of developing a batch of world-class higher education institutions and disciplines in China. Peking University, Renmin University of China and Tsinghua University are among the 42 universities listed."

""Cooperation with CCTSS means complementary advantages in both writers and translators resources."",Liu Li, president of Beijing Language and Culture University said that ""the university has always been rooted in Chinese culture and taught foreign students the essence of Chinese literature."" ""China's overseas development in culture falls behind our economic and scientific advancement,"" said Huang Zhuoyue, director of the Chinese Culture Translation and Communication Research Center. ""Business exchange brings profits, while cultural understanding wins people's hearts."" Yan Jingming, vice-chairman of the China Writers Association, pointed out that the situation of global communication had altered as China's overall national strength has been rising. ""More Chinese writers and critics have entered the international arena. More sinologists choose to translate contemporary Chinese literature."" ""The next step is to let the world know more about Chinese writers, integrate our resources and further promote Chinese literature to the global community,"" Yan said."
0,"BEIJING -- Affected by ""adverse atmospheric diffusion conditions,"" heavily polluted weather is like to haunt the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area and its surrounding regions in the next 10 days, an official forecast said Saturday. Beijing, in particular, will see a drastic change in air quality, with moderate or serious pollution to come from Dec 19 to 22. The arrival of northernly winds will help improve the city's air quality starting from Dec 23. Air pollution in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region will gradually ease around Dec 24 thanks to a cold air effect, said the Ministry of Ecology and Environment in an air quality report for the rest of December. In the Yangtze River Delta, air quality is expected to stay good or slightly polluted, while in Fenhe and Weihe river basin in Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces, the chances of lasting serious air pollution are slim. In the next 10 days, air quality in northeastern China will be about average. The central and western part of Liaoning however might suffer from moderate or serious air pollution on Saturday, with PM 2.5 being the primary pollutant. The pollution process will gradually ease from Sunday to Monday thanks to good atmospheric diffusion. Air pollution of various degrees is also likely to appear in southern, southwest and northwest China."
0,"Beijing, Tianjin and surrounding areas dramatically exceeded their air pollution reduction targets through the fall and winter months, while the mayors of three cities were summoned after failing to meet their own targets, according to China's top environmental authority. The Ministry of Ecology and Environment released the performance of 28 major cities in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region on Thursday, showing PM2.5 levels from October to March. The average concentration of PM2.5 in 28 cities shrank to 78 micrograms per cubic meter, a year-on-year decrease of 25 percent. And the number of days with heavy pollution was reduced by 55.4 percent. The target for both the reduction of PM2.5 and number of days of heavy air pollution was 15 percent. The goals were set by the former ministry of environmental protection in October in 2017. PM2.5 refers to dangerous particulate matter with a diameter of less than 2.5 microns that can enter the bloodstream via the lungs. During the six months, Beijing, Langfang, Hebei province, and Tianjin performed best in cutting the concentration of PM2.5. Hebei's Handan, and Jincheng and Yangquan in Shanxi province, were the worst of the 28 cities and failed to meet their own smog-fighting targets. Their mayors were summoned to a meeting at the Ministry of Ecology and Environment in Beijing on Thursday and ordered to account for their poor results. Jincheng was the only city that failed on both metrics - reducing particulates and fewer days with heavy pollution. During the six-month period, its average concentration of PM2.5 fell by 3.7 percent. Its target was 10 percent. Meanwhile, 1,819 environmental problems of various kinds were found in Jincheng in the period, the most among the 28 cities. In addition, some steel and foundry companies in Jincheng did not halt production as required on heavily polluted days. Handan's average PM2.5 concentration decreased by 12.2 percent. Its goal was 15 percent. According to the ministry, Handan was summoned over its poor rectification effort in August. But during this campaign, 61 obvious environmental problems were noticed in the city, including six cases of excessive emissions, two of falsifying online monitoring data and 11 of missing pollution control equipment. Yangquan was found to be sluggish on cutting air pollution. Its average PM2.5 concentration rose by more than 30 percent in the year's first quarter, compared with 2017's last quarter. It also had serious dust pollution and other random emissions. The ministry ordered the three cities to make remediation plans within 20 work days and to immediately stop approving new projects that would pollute the air. The three mayors all pledged to face up to the problem. On Thursday, the ministry sent a letter to the provincial governments of Shandong, Shanxi and Henan, saying that they should hold officials at city and county level responsible for pollution on their watch, including deputy mayors and deputy county heads. The ministry said a number of companies based in Shanxi, Shandong and Henan provinces failed to halt production on heavily polluted days in March. jiangchenglong@chinadaily.com.cn"
1,"After a buoyant property market signaled cheer over the planned creation of another economic engine in the form of the Xiongan New Area in Hebei province, stock markets followed suit. Investors turned bullish on shares of companies involved in development, infrastructure, construction materials and transportation. Such shares surged on Monday, especially those of companies with their core business in Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei, with a focus on construction materials, utilities and real estate development. Shares in Hong Kong-listed Beijing Enterprises Water Group Co rose 6.8 percent to HK$6.11 (79 cents), while gas distributor China Suntien Green Energy Co gained 12 percent to HK$1.68. BBMG, a Beijing-based maker of cement and construction materials, surged 34.67 percent to HK$4.75. Stock markets in Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong were closed on Tuesday for the Tomb-Sweeping holiday break. Trading will resume on Wednesday. Analysts said the government's plans for the new area will likely further boost sentiment toward stocks of related companies headquartered in Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei province. For, the new area's long-term influence is seen benefiting urban development, transportation and utility sectors. For real estate developers, uncertainties remain as new policies for property development are likely to be unconventional in the new area, said Guan Qingyou, an analyst with Minsheng Securities Co. For instance, at the end of 2016, Shanghai-listed China Fortune Land Development Co Ltd, a Beijing-headquartered industrial park developer, had two projects in the new area, with a combined space of more than 500 square kilometers for long-term planned development. The company said onSunday it has not yet received any notification on changes to the projects, debunking rumors that all the contracts for projects in the new area became invalid after Saturday. The projects are still in the stage of planning and positioning, the company said in a regulatory filing. CFLD said it recognizes that the two projects are subject to policy changes, and the company will operate fully in alignment with the national strategy supporting the development of the new area. The Xiongan New Area will serve to advance the coordinated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, a ""strategy crucial for a millennium to come"", according to a government circular issued on Saturday. The area, which is 100 kilometers southwest of Beijing, will span three counties, cover around 100 sq km in the initial stage, expanding to 200 sq km in the medium term before finally reaching 2,000 sq km in the long term, according to Xinhua News Agency. Wang Delun, an analyst with Industrial Securities Co, said the launch of the Xiongan New Area marks a milestone in the coordinated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, which will benefit industries in Hebei immediately, particularly real estate development and infrastructure. ""First, the move is likely to quickly benefit companies headquartered in Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei that provide steel and construction materials. Second, port and airport operators are likely to benefit as a result of a revised and more rational plan for local transportation and logistics,"" said Wang."
0,"BEIJING — Beijing will appoint chiefs of streets and hutongs in the urban area by June to improve environmental management, authorities said Friday. The chiefs, usually main leaders of sub-district and township governments and their subordinates, will be responsible for improving the environment around, according to the municipal commission of urban management. Volunteer hutong keepers will be selected from residents to help with management, said the statement. Last April, Beijing released a three-year plan for improving minor streets and hutongs in the central area, but problems remain serious, said an official with the commission. According to the official, only one ninth of the total number of more than 1,800 minor streets and hutongs meet the standard required by the plan, including no illegal advertisements, no road damage, no illegal businesses and no random dumping of garbage. Appointment of hutong chiefs is of great significance in protecting the appearance of the capital, improving the living environment and raising the standard of urban management, he said."

0,"Local governments should pay more attention to the translation of public signs, because they are important elements in shaping the image of a city in the eyes of foreigners, language experts and government officials said. Shi Yanhua, former director of the translation office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said some local governments have not invested enough money and resources into improving the translation of public signs, leading to some ridiculous translations. They should strengthen the regulation on translation and any new signs should first be approved by relevant government authorities before being posted in public, she said on Monday at a sub-forum of the 2018 annual conference of the Translators association of China. The conference was co-hosted by the association and the China Foreign Languages Publishing Administration. Different cities have different translations for the same type of sign, she said - for example, ring road in Beijing, belt road in Shanghai and boulevard in Shenzhen mean the same thing and should be consistent. Chen Mingming, executive vice-president of the translators association, said signs in places frequently visited by foreigners, including airports, subways, hotels and scenic spots, should be priorities, and there should be no translation mistakes in these signs. Not all signs need to be translated, he said. ""Public signs with unique expressions using Chinese characteristics need no translation,"" Chen said. Zhang Qian, deputy director of the foreign affairs office of the Beijing municipal government, said many people have not realized the importance of sign translation. The office once found a cigarette and liquor store on Beijing's Wangfujing street with a sign that said ""name cigarette, name liquor"", when the translation should have been ""brand name cigarettes and liquor,"" she said. ""We told the owner of the store to change the sign, but he told us he would not spend money on such a trivial matter. He would only change it if the office agreed to pay for the new sign."" Liu Liu, head of the translation office of the foreign affairs office of Guangzhou, Guangdong province, said similar incidents have occurred in that city, with many people thinking it doesn't matter what the English sign means as long as there is an English translation. The city government has put a lot of effort into regulating the translation of signs, including developing a mini app in WeChat where netizens can win gifts by taking a picture of an incorrect translation, Liu said. Also on Monday, nine well-known translators received the Lifetime Achievement Award in Translation, the highest award for translators in China from the association. They joined the ranks of 18 other highly acclaimed translators who have received the award, including Ji Xianlin and Xu Yuanchong."
1,"The rapid development of China's sharing economy has seen a growing number of people opting to provide services on a casual basis for companies that operate via online apps, providing designated drivers, cleaners, couriers and food delivery to homes and offices. About 70 million people were working in the sector last year, and the number is expected to hit 100 million in 2020, according to the State Information Center under the National Development and Reform Commission. However, the casual nature of the arrangement means that many companies do not offer employment contracts or insurance in the event of sickness or injury, and there is no paid leave. Essentially, if an employee is unable to work, they receive nothing. Wang Haoyu's story is a case in point. After his pelvis and legs were injured in a road accident in March, the 19-year-old deliveryman spent two weeks convalescing at his dormitory outside the north Fifth Ring Road in Beijing. From his sickbed, Wang watched as his comrades left early in the morning and returned late at night, and the realization that they were earning while he was not filled him with anxiety. ""They were all making money, but I wasn't. On the contrary, someone actually owed me money but wouldn't pay up, so I was quite worried,"" he said. That ""someone"" was the driver of a BMW who caused Wang's injuries when he turned unexpectedly, hitting the native of Kaifeng, Henan province, and severely damaging his electric bike. At the time of the accident, Wang, who arrived in the capital in April, was working as a delivery rider for Baidu Waimai, an online food platform. The severe bruising he sustained left him unable to work, and as he had no medical insurance he had to pay 800 yuan ($123) for health checks and medication, and it cost 1,700 yuan to have his e-bike repaired. The traffic police concluded that the driver was entirely responsible for the accident and was liable to pay compensation. However, he flatly refused to pay, and though Wang had the option of suing for compensation, he decided against legal action because it would entail considerable time and energy. Instead, he repeatedly contacted the driver to request compensation, but was turned down every time. ""I only earn 200 to 300 yuan ($30 to $46) a day, but the accident cost me about 2,500 yuan,"" he said. ""What's more, I earned nothing while I was recuperating. I was so depressed."" During his two-week layoff, he was desperate to start earning again. ""I just wanted to recover as soon as possible to make money,"" he said.,Wang didn't know that his medical costs would have been covered if his employer had provided insurance against occupational injury. However, like many of the 70 million people employed in the sharing economy, he was not covered for occupational injury and had no access to a medical care program. China's Labor Law and the Labor Contract Law stipulate that companies judged to have ""labor relations"" with employees are obliged to contribute the lion's share of payments toward five types of social security, including injury, medical and endowment insurance, while workers pay a minimal amount. However, while the signing of an employment contract is often seen as signifying ""labor relations"", the law does not provide a standard definition. Meanwhile, few people who work for online platforms sign labor contracts, meaning they are not technically employed by the platforms, which are therefore not required to contribute to their social security payments. E-Daijia, a leading designated driver platform, said its 200,000 drivers are classified as part-time employees. ""They all have their own formal jobs, and are free to offer their services or rest any time they want. We sign service contracts with them directly and have no obligation to shoulder their social security requirements,"" said Zhang Dongpeng, a publicity officer for the company. Platforms such as E-Daijia provide drivers for clients who are either unwilling or unable to drive their vehicles for various reasons, such as excessive alcohol consumption or the need to work en route. The designated drivers, who ride small e-bikes, accept orders via the company's mobile app, and when they rendezvous with the client they simply load their bike into the trunk of the car and drive to the specified destination. Other platforms, such as Ele.me, Baidu Waimai and Meituan Waimai-the country's three biggest online food delivery platforms-use a more complex employment model in which they cooperate with third-party companies that recruit casual workers via service contracts. The arrangement means neither the third party nor the online platform is obliged to contribute toward workers' social security payments. ""The model understands the needs of the delivery industry and benefits our operating efficiency,"" said Cai Min, a publicity official with Ele.me. Liu Zhong works as a designated driver for Didi Daijia, a larger competitor of E-Daijia, in Beijing. ""I signed a service contract with a HR company in Zhejiang province, even though I work in Beijing. The contract I signed makes no mention of social security payments,"" said the 28-year-old native of Henan province. Calls requesting an interview with Didi Daijia were not returned. Jiang Ying, director of the School of Law at China University of Labor Relations, said the model has a high degree of flexibility. ""Online platforms outsource their labor requirements to third-party companies. There's no fixed period of employment, so the platforms can decide whether to continue to use workers according to the prevailing business conditions,"" she said. ""Additionally, the model saves the online platforms money. Hiring workers directly requires high expenditure-for example, contributing to their social security payments. ""However, without the security provided by employment injury, medical and endowment insurance, the workers may experience financial troubles if they are involved in an accident, fall sick or just grow too old to do the job."",China is the world's biggest food delivery market. According to Meituan Waimai, Ele.me and Baidu Waimai, toward the end of last year, their combined 1 million riders delivered more than 27 million orders every day. Though Xue Dongdong, a food delivery rider in Beijing, signed a service contract with Beijing Fengqiao Freight Co, a third-party outfit, he works for Baidu Waimai. The 28-year-old from Shanxi province often works about 16 hours a day. ""I usually go to work at 6:30 am and arrive back at the dormitory at about 11 pm. If I don't do that, I won't fulfill my order quota,"" he said, adding that he has to make at least 400 deliveries a day just to collect his basic salary. He noted that the food delivery industry has high and low seasons, according to the weather. ""The number of people who go out to eat falls during the hottest days of summer and the coldest days in winter-orders rise at those times. Right now, we don't have many orders because it's the low season, so I only earn about 4,000 yuan a month,"" he said, speaking in April ahead of the summer heat. The riders accept orders via the company's app, and the amount they receive per order depends on the prices of the dishes requested and the distance they have to ride to deliver them. Time is the big factor. Xue's contract stipulates that every order should be completed within 37 minutes-if not, he only receives half the agreed fee. The situation means delivery operatives often ride too quickly and always keep an eye on their smartphones when in transit, searching for more orders, which places them at a greater risk of accidents. ""We all know it is dangerous, but customers place lots of orders at lunch and dinner times. If we don't accept them on the mobile app within a certain time, our salaries will be affected,"" he said. The contract he signed with Beijing Fengqiao Freight clearly states that the company has no obligation to contribute to its riders' social security payments. Initially, Xue wanted to find a job that provided social security, but his opinion changed when he realized he would have to make a contribution himself. ""I think it's more beneficial to save cash now. I don't really see any advantages to having social security at normal times,"" he said. According to CNBC, Deliveroo, a leading global online food delivery platform, is providing free medical insurance for 35,000 food delivery riders in 12 countries. The program covers as much as 75 percent of a rider's average income if they sustain an injury while working. However, the company declined to provide further benefits because it believes additional help could jeopardize the workers' self-employed status.,The third-party model has also prompted labor disputes. Ofo, one of China's leading providers of shared bikes, used the model to employ people to locate damaged bikes and move them to designated locations. However, according to news portal Jiemian, some workers staged a protest outside Ofo's Shanghai office in May, claiming they had been fired without warning after failing to meet what they believed were unreasonable targets. Ofo has denied the allegations. Given the rapid development of the sharing economy, some workers are happy to accept the lack of security as a necessary evil, while others have adopted a ""once bitten, twice shy"" approach. ""I believe that social security would be good for us, but it is not practical for my nominal employer (the HR company in Zhejiang) and Didi Daijia to pay my insurance,"" said Liu, the designated driver in Beijing. ""However, I don't intend to change my job because I am not skilled in any other work."" Wang Haoyu, the rider who was hit by a car in March, has conceded defeat in his attempts to obtain compensation from the driver. He has quit his job and returned to his hometown in Henan. ""I don't want to continue with the job because I felt helpless when dealing with the aftermath of the accident. If such a thing were to happen to me in the future, I would feel there was nothing I could do to claim the compensation due to me,"" he said. ""In future, I will only accept a job that provides social security payments, even if the salary isn't very good."""
0,"Since his first visit to Beijing in 1981, the country has had a special place in the life of filmmaker Malcolm Clarke. On his latest trip to Beijing, Oscar-winning director Malcolm Clarke recalled the first time he visited the Chinese capital in 1981. At an event held by China International Communication Corp to announce a series of projects that will be coproduced with foreign partners, Clarke was invited to speak about, and share his experience of, making documentaries. Since starting his nearly 40-year-long career as a filmmaker at the BBC, Clarke has traveled to 86 countries to shoot numerous documentary films. In 1984, he won a best director Emmy for Soldiers of The Twilight, and followed that up with two Academy Awards for best documentary (short subject) for You Don't Have to Die in 1989 and The Lady in Number 6 in 2014. For Clarke, however, China has been an important chapter of his life. Back in 1981 when Clarke had just moved from his native United Kingdom to New York to work for the American Broadcasting Company, he was assigned to the Chinese capital to carry out research for a new documentary project that was intended to examine the changes that had occurred in New China since it was founded in 1949. ""Lots of things were happening in China then. The country was just getting back on its feet,"" he recalls. Like most foreign guests who visited China in the early 1980s, he stayed at the Beijing Hotel, which faces south toward Chang'an Avenue. Every morning he would wake up to the ringing of bicycle bells and was astonished to look out of his window and see the street flooded with hundreds of locals biking their way to work. Over the following nine months, Clarke traveled deeper into the country, from far-flung mountain villages in Sichuan province, to regions alongside the Yangtze and Yellow rivers, and he talked to people from many different walks of life.,""Once I got into the countryside, the locals were shocked and surprised at the unusual sight－in those days, my hair was still brown and I have blue eyes－yet, they were so incredibly kind and hospitable to me. ""I never saw anyone unemployed. Everyone seemed to be working really hard, and it was very clear to me that if somehow all this energy could be harnessed and driven in the right direction, China would become a country with colossal potential,"" he says. Clarke was disappointed when ABC aborted the production of the documentary due to changes in the relationship between China and the United States, but nearly 30 years after his first Chinese tour, Clarke returned to the country in 2013 to direct Better Angels, a documentary suggested by former US secretary of state, Henry Kissinger, and Nobel Prize-winning economist, Robert Mundell. Directed by Clarke and coproduced by American producer William Mundell and Chinese producer Han Yi, the documentary－which looks into the future of China and the US through the eyes of ordinary people in the two countries－took nearly five years to complete. As well as Better Angels, which is scheduled for release in China and the US in November, Clarke has also recently produced another Chinese-themed documentary, In My Eyes. Directed by Han Yi, the feature film follows the journey of Cao Shengkang, China's first known blind global backpacker－who has traveled alone to 34 countries on five continents. Speaking about modern China, Clarke acknowledges that the country has completely changed since his first visit three decades ago, and Beijing has become an impressive international metropolis full of hope and opportunity.,""Some people call China's transformation the rise of China, but for me, it's actually the renaissance of China because, for many centuries, this country maintained the most sophisticated culture on the planet. ""It's really only in the last 200 years, under pressure from Western colonial powers that China's progress was thwarted. I think that now, however, China is rapidly re-establishing its rightful place as an innovative, exciting, technologically advanced country,"" says the filmmaker. ""One of the things I think China has yet to achieve, though, is a balance with the rest of the world, because the world still misunderstands China and, where misunderstandings exist, there is a place for fear to grow."" As a veteran storyteller, Clarke believes that finding an emotionally engaging way of telling stories about the Chinese people can help the rest of the world better understand the country. ""What is interesting about the Chinese way of making documentary films is that filmmakers often start with the written word, a script. Only after the script is written do they venture out and shoot images that fit what has been written."" Clarke believes this approach inevitably excludes what to him is the richest aspect of documentary filmmaking: the spontaneity of events that happen on location ""in the moment"".,The things that could never be anticipated can often become the most powerful scenes in the final version of a documentary, he adds. Clarke describes the country as ""a gold mine"" for documentary filmmakers and he says he plans to shoot two new features in the coming months. After helping Chinese director Lu Chunqiao with her directorial debut－a film on some teenage survivors of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, he has used the true stories of the survivors as the inspiration for a film, which will be set in Sichuan province, during the disaster. His second project will be a docudrama based upon the 2009 book, The Man Who Loved China, about British scientist Joseph Needham, who chronicled China's scientific achievements over the millennia in his masterpiece, Science and Civilisation in China"

The 40-day Spring Festival travel rush, beginning on Thursday, is the largest annual human migration. Some 2.98 billion trips are expected to be made. The administration has approved 26,394 additional domestic flights and 2,716 international ones. During the travel rush, more than 2.1 million seats can be provided each day, making a total of 840 million seats over the 40-day travel rush, said Wang Zhiqing, deputy head of the administration. ""The seats will completely meet the demand,"" he added. The National Development and Reform commission said 650 million trips are expected to made by air during the travel rush. Wang noted that peaks will fall on Feb 13, 14, 21 and March 3. Tickets are sufficient. Only 32 percent of departure tickets are sold in the five busiest airports across China in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, according to Wang. The Beijing Capital International Airport, the busiest in China, will handle 10.96 milliontrips during the travel rush, about one-sixth of flight passengers across the country. The airport will handle 68,200 flights during the rush and 1,704 flights each day. The peak will fall on Feb 6, which is expected to handle about 284,000 trips. Return peaks will fall on Feb 21 and March 6. The airports aim to provide high-quality service during the rush. For example, charging devices have been installed. ""The insufficient power outlet has been a long-time concern. We've been racking our brains to add more charging stations to meet the soaring demand of travelers in recent years,"" said Lei Lei, the deputy general manager of the service department at the BCIA. Air China, China's flagship airline, will provide 10 million seats, an increase of 11.84 percent, during the upcoming travel rush. Additional flights and wide-body jets are arranged on popular routes by Air China. For example, more domestic flights are arranged from Beijing to Sanya, Haikou, Lijiang, Dali and other popular destinations; more international flights are arranged from Beijing to Hawaii and Shanghai to Bangkok.

1,"China and Qatar should enhance cooperation comprehensively in four major areas — energy, infrastructure construction, high technology and investment, President Xi Jinping said on Thursday. Xi made the remark while meeting with Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. The two leaders witnessed the signing of a number of cooperation documents by China and Qatar. The two countries should further connect their development strategies and jointly build the Belt and Road, Xi said. The president pointed out that China and Qatar have established a framework of cooperation covering such areas as oil and gas, infrastructure, finance and investment. China supports Qatar’s exploration of a development path that fits its own national situation, and it appreciates Qatar’s stance on upholding the one-China policy, Xi said. China would like to enhance communication with Qatar and deepen mutual political trust, Xi said. The president expressed gratitude for Qatar’s firm support on issues related to China’s core interests. The two countries should strengthen communications and share experiences regarding international cooperation on anti-terrorism and anti-extremism issues, Xi said. Xi called for joint efforts to further boost people-to-people exchanges and support each other in hosting the Winter Olympic Games in China and the FIFA World Cup in Qatar in 2022. Regional cooperation and stability is the basis for the prosperity of the Gulf region, Xi said, adding that China supports the Arabic countries of the Gulf region in their handling of disagreements properly through political and diplomatic manners. In the talks, Xi mentioned Tamim’s state visit to China in 2014, when the two countries announced their intention to build a strategic partnership. It is pleasing to see that the consensuses reached by the two leaders in 2014 have been implemented and have brought real benefits to the people of both sides, Xi said. Tamim said that Qatar expects to strengthen cooperation with China in a wide range of fields, including energy, investment, science and infrastructure construction. Noting that Qatar and China are strategic partners, Tamim said that the friendly relationship between the two countries has developed rapidly in recent years. Qatar has full confidence in China’s economy, and it is one of the countries that supported the Belt and Road Initiative from the beginning, he said. Chinese companies are welcome to invest in Qatar, he said, adding that Qatar is dedicated to increasing exchanges in culture, tourism and media with China. Qatar appreciates China’s role in multilateral affairs and its constructive stance on the problems of the Middle East and Gulf region, he added. Premier Li Keqiang also met with Tamim in Beijing on Thursday."

""We will provide about 80,000 homes for business trips in over 50 cities by the end of this year, starting from Shenzhen, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Chengdu,"" said the company's CEO Chen Chi. Rooms for business travelers, priced at 300 to 400 yuan ($44 to $58), are equipped with office supplies and an invoice is promised to be provided within 11 working days. Another new service designed for business travelers is monthly settlement and company accounts, but the company admitted it needs the support of a stronger IT system. When asked about the reason to start such a new product, Chen said ""last year, more than 15 percent of our users chose our service for business trips"". In 2015, business travelers accounted for 36.5 percent of overall home-sharing users, while half were individual tourists, according to a report by Beijing-based internet consultancy Analysys. Chen said the service initially targeted young employees in startups and SMEs, but some large enterprises have also showed an interest. So far, a dozen internet companies, maker spaces and co-working offices have signed cooperation agreements with Xiaozhu. As young people born in 1990s become the major part of the labor force and with the growth of startups, business trip demand is becoming more diversified and personalized, he said. His goal is to team up with 5,000 corporates and serve 100,000 users within this year. Tang Wu, a young entrepreneur who operates a dozen shared homes in Shenzhen, said many of his clients are business travelers. His first ""home"" was located right behind a five-star hotel near the city's exhibition center. In future, he plans to provide space of 170 to 200 square meters, and supply visual equipment and meeting facilities. Dang Jianwei, an expert on innovative economies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, said startups and SMEs, who are highly sensitive to costs, may be interested in such new services. However, the challenge is to win large enterprise users who need guaranteed standardization of services, he said."
0,"Israeli violist Avri Levitan gave 10 recitals within three days during his recent stay in Beijing. From children and senior citizens to audiences at a health center and a live-music venue, Levitan showed that classical music, which is regarded as high-art by some, can be accessible to people of various backgrounds. There is no difference between playing for a nation's top official, a homeless person, someone in prison or a court judge, he says. ""We choose the program list like any other musician preparing for recitals at concert halls. The only thing we pay attention to is the high quality of the performance."" Levitan concluded his trip in Beijing with a recital at the Forbidden City Concert Hall on May 25. Along with Chinese classical guitarist Wang Chuting, he played pieces, including Johann Sebastian Bach's  Franz Schubert's  and Manuel De Falla's seven Spanish popular songs,  . ""It's an inspiring experience for me to work with Levitan. He has his own understanding of music. As a young music student, I learned that it's not only important to be a good musician in terms of the technique but also a good musician for society at large,"" says Wang. The 20-year-old, who studies at the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing, played with Levitan during some of his recitals. This is the idea behind Berlin-based Musethica program, a nonprofit Levitan co-founded with economics teacher Carmen Marcuello in Spain in 2012. The name, Musethica, is a combination of music and aesthetics. The program chooses young musicians to play at public concerts as part of their education. The majority of such concerts are held in places where people have little access to music, such as hospitals, prisons and shelter homes. Now, Musethica is active in eight countries, including Germany, Poland, Spain and Israel. Three years ago, it came to China for the first time. Levitan takes his 7-year-old son, Yona, to Musethica concerts. ""Once my son told me, 'Papa, there is no time. Time only exists in computers.' I found it interesting because indeed, there is no time in music. Music is the pure present,"" says Levitan, 43. ""For children, music is pure sound."" His job as a teacher inspired Levitan to take his nonprofit forward. ""When we learn to be instrumentalists, we practice all the time in our rooms, but we don't play for the people. We give recitals in schools to impress the teacher, to win awards or to become famous. It's not the real interest of being a musician,"" says Levitan, who is a viola and chamber music professor at Zaragoza Music Conservatory in Spain. He encourages his students to teach themselves instead of always telling them what to do. For musicians joining the Musethica program, Levitan says they neither get money nor become famous. ""They only have to play beautifully."" Levitan was born in Tel Aviv and was introduced to music by his parents, who were big fans of classical music and jazz. He started learning the viola at age 5. As a young boy, he didn't like to practice. ""I liked football. My friends are not musicians. But when I stopped playing music, after one or two days, I realized that I cannot live without music,"" he recalls. Levitan performs regularly as a soloist in some of the world's most prestigious concert halls, such as the Vienna Konzerthaus, and in collaboration with chamber and symphony orchestras. He was the BBC Music Magazine Awards nominee in 2009 and the Royal Philharmonic Society Awards nominee in 2012. Now, he is working with organizations, such as the Forbidden City Concert Hall and music schools in Beijing, to make Musethica a long-term project in China. ""We hope to introduce more concerts at all types of venues and for all kinds of audiences,"" he says."

He was among the 5.7 million young people who took the first gaokao after a more than 10-year suspension in 1977 and was admitted to Peking University's Law School. He visited Peking University last year and took a photo with foreign students.Wu Zhiyi/china Daily  Born in 1949 in Beihai, Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, Chen moved to Beijing when he was 8. In 1968, he graduated from the High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China and became a coal miner in western Beijing during the ""cultural revolution"" (1966-76). He was admitted to the Chinese literature department of Peking University after passing the gaokao in 1977. Over the years, several of his works have been published overseas in Korean, Japanese, French and English.  Born in 1951 in Miluo, Hunan province, Jiang graduated from high school in 1969 before serving in the army. He passed the gaokao in 1977 and was admitted to Peking University's Law School.  He began working at the university after graduating in 1982, and is now an expert on the Constitution and administrative law.

0,"One of China's top universities pledged on Sunday to establish systems to prevent sexual harassment, after a former professor was exposed online for a scandal dating back two decades. Peking University said it will introduce reporting channels and educational campaigns to ensure a safe, harmonious campus built on gender equality, vowing zero-tolerance for teachers who violate the code of ethics. The move comes after Shen Yang, a Chinese language professor who worked at the Beijing school until 2011, was accused of inappropriate behavior in the '90s with a student named Gao Yan, who committed suicide. The allegation came to light late last week when Li Youyou, a classmate of Gao's who is now in Canada, posted an item about the case on social networking site Douban. It became one of the hottest topics online during the Tomb Sweeping Festival break. On Friday, Peking University issued a statement that said Shen had been given an official warning in 1998 based on a police report. On Sunday, the school issued a further statement, in which it attached two files regarding the warning. The files say that Gao had sought a relationship with Shen in 1997. Shen was divorced at the time. Although Shen had no intention of having a relationship with Gao, he still said, ""You can be called my girlfriend."" He then kissed her. Shen stopped seeing Gao in June of 1997. Nine months later, the student killed herself. She was 21. A police investigation into the case found that the professor had displayed ""inappropriate behavior"" and violated teaching ethics, the statement said. Shanghai Normal University, where Shen has been teaching part-time, said in a brief statement on Saturday that it canceled his contract after learning of the scandal. It did not elaborate. Nanjing University's School of Liberal Arts, where Shen is a faculty member, has asked him to resign. The school's administrative department said it did not perform a background check during his transfer and was unaware of the punishment handed out in 1998. ""Online public opinion has already severely affected the school's normal teaching order and academic reputation,"" the school said in a statement. ""Shen is no longer suitable to work here."" Shen did not respond to requests for comment on Sunday. However, in an interview with Beijing News on Friday, he denied the accusations as ""malicious defamation"". Shen is the second Chinese scholar to lose his job this year in connection with a sex scandal. In January, Chen Xiaowu, a professor at Beijing’s Beihang University, was fired after the school investigated a sexual harassment accusation by a former female student on social media. The Ministry of Education stripped Chen of his Changjiang Scholars Award, the country’s highest academic honor for individuals, saying it would not tolerate activity that harms students. It said it would look into setting up a robust mechanism to prevent sexual harassment."
0,"The north branch of Beijing's Haidian District Library will host 25 cultural activities in April, as public interest in tradition has continued to grow in recent years, thanks in part to popular TV programs. The activities promote guoxue, which is loosely defined as the study of ancient Chinese civilization - specifically, such realms as history, philosophy, literature and art. Participants will learn about stone rubbing, incense, book binding and music. The library has also staged an activity to recommend books about the integration of tradition into modern life. It hosted an event attended by experts from the Chinese mainland and Taiwan on April 3 to discuss the integration of ancient culture into contemporary education. Beijing-based historian and publisher Ren Deshan said at the event that studying tradition is important to building cultural confidence and identity. ""Essentially, guoxue assists individuals' comprehensive development. It ... serves as a foundation that helps young people learn other subjects,"" he says. Calligrapher and culture expert Duan Junping says: ""Chinese people were educated in the classics for thousands of years to become useful members of society. But we need new concepts and innovations to promote traditional culture amid the explosion of information in the digital age."" Studying tradition means more than wearing ancient attire and reciting texts, he says. More practical learning methods should be adopted, including those that use the internet, Duan believes. He says social support, especially from the family, is key to cultivating culture. Duan's grandfather, for instance, inspired him to become a calligrapher. Zhu Anshun, a guest professor of the Chinese Culture Academy of Chongqing and director of the Zhonghua Book Co's classics-education center, says there are obstacles to promoting tradition among youth.,Most parents worry that their children's academic performance will suffer if they spend too much time on guoxue. And some parents enroll their children in classes about culture for purely practical reasons, such as helping their academic and career advancement. ""They're not confident enough in traditional culture. So they choose the short-term focus on exams over the long-term benefits of guoxue."" He believes society should become conducive to cultural studies and promote the idea that they offer comprehensive benefits. There are many private institutions that teach traditional culture. But public schools are ""the main battlefield"", he believes. He has personally made efforts to promote guoxue in the public-education system, he says. Zhu believes schools should change the way they teach traditional culture, which typically requires learning the classics by rote, to make lessons more interesting. Publisher Li Ke, who also lectures on traditional culture, says a growing number of education officials and teachers have been making efforts to blend essential elements of traditional culture into current curriculums. Some have staged successful experiments that balance guoxue and academic performance, he says. ""This is very meaningful,"" he says. ""It proves that learning traditional culture doesn't create conflict with exam scores."""

1,"BEIJING - China's anti-dumping measures on US sorghum will not have a great impact on China, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce (MOC) said Thursday. The MOC announced Tuesday that it will impose provisional anti-dumping measures on grain sorghum imported from the United States. A preliminary ruling by the MOC found that US companies had dumped grain sorghum on the Chinese market, and such imports had caused substantial damage to the domestic industry. Starting on Wednesday, importers of the product are required to pay deposits with Chinese customs based on a rate of 178.6 percent calculation, according to the ministry. The higher tariff on US sorghum will generally not impact domestic consumption, Gao Feng, the MOC spokesman said, citing that China is a major grain producer with steady output in recent years. China is prepared for the possible impact of these measures, Gao added. China's total grain imports from the United States, including wheat and corn, account for less than 2 percent of domestic consumption, according to the MOC data."
1,"Beijing's city government has pledged to continue to improve the quality of teachers at countryside schools, as well as boost their incomes, to provide equal education opportunities to urban and rural students. The capital will offer incentives to encourage teachers to stay in rural areas, Li Yi, deputy director of the Beijing Education Commission, said at a news conference on Wednesday. The city began encouraging normal schools to increase enrollment of students majoring in teaching last year. Meanwhile, authorities have promised to give 40,000 yuan ($6,100) to each rural teacher who graduates from a normal school or comprehensive college with a nonteaching major and who has been working in a rural area for five successive years. In addition, each teacher will receive a monthly allowance of between 1,400 and 4,000 yuan, depending on the distance of their work from the center city. By Nov 6, 17,489 rural teachers in 383 schools had received the allowance. Li said the government is also discussing the provision of low-cost rental housing for rural teachers. Beijing has allocated 20 percent more financial support to the training of rural teachers compared with urban-based teachers. Rural teachers who go to urban schools for training will receive 530 yuan per person each time. Xu Guowen, the principal of a primary school in Miyun district, who has been working in rural schools for 23 years, said he has experienced the development of education in villages. ""It was hard to keep rural teachers because of many practical reasons, including long-distance transportation, taking care of families in faraway places, and individual career development,"" Xu said. ""The turnover of rural teachers resulted in a low quality of education for students."" He said the new policies have given financial support and housing subsidies to rural teachers, as well as many training projects, which have given rural teachers more confidence. Cui Haiming, a physical education teacher in Huairou district, has been working in rural schools for 28 years. In 2013, he started working in a primary school in a remote mountain area as a volunteer, he said at the news conference. When the voluntary period came to an end, he decided to stay. He said the district government has helped equip the school with new sports facilities, which has improved teaching conditions. ""My salary was 5,000 yuan a month in 2014. As the subsidies have been implemented, I now get about 10,000 yuan a month, which has improved my living conditions,"" Cui said. He said he will stay at the rural school until retirement."

You have made contributions to advance New Zealand's relations with China, and I hope you will continue your important role in advancing China-New Zealand relations,"" the premier said. China will further efforts in building a fair business environment in which domestic and foreign companies are treated equally, continuing to make China the most attractive destination for investments, Li said. Li said China's economic growth exceeded expectations during the first half of this year, with the economic structure having been prioritized and with greater contributions by the service industry and consumption. ""Opening up to the outside world has been our fundamental policy, and China's door will be opened even wider,"" he said. The premier added that China would like to work with New Zealand in developing their ties and cooperation, and contribute to the stability and development of the Asia-Pacific region. Key said Li's visit to his country in March saw new progress in developing those areas. New Zealand and China are good friends and partners, and New Zealand positively regards the prospect of China's development while being committed to strengthening the partnership and cooperation, he said. Key made a six-day visit to Beijing as prime minister in April 2016. Li, during his visit to New Zealand in March, met for talks with new Prime Minister Bill English. The two countries opened negotiations in April on upgrading their free trade agreement. The second round of negotiations was held in Beijing this month, focusing on customs procedures, trade facilitation, e-commerce and agricultural cooperation. In New Zealand, former officials have a strong influence, and Thursday's meeting can be seen as a step forward in bilateral ties, especially with additional negotiations, said Chen Fengying, a senior researcher on the world economy at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations. In 2008, New Zealand became the first developed economy to sign a free-trade agreement with China, focusing on commodity trading and not including trade in services, Chen said.

It was no ordinary day in class - the musicians were vying for top honors at the Nov 4 finals of the annual Midi School Bands Contest. In the evening, Beijing-based indie band Gentle Grape was crowned champion. ""It was awesome and I cried out at that moment,"" recalls its lead vocalist Li Xuezhen. The 23-year-old, who is pursuing his master's degree in mineral engineering at the China University of Mining and Technology in Beijing, says the band celebrated with a barbecue and beers. Gentle Grape stood out among the 12 finalists. Its performances during the contest attracted more than 1,000 viewers on site and more than 850,000 viewers online. Launched in 2011 by the school, the contest caters to young Chinese bands, with each group required to have at least one member who is a college student. According to Yin Long, CEO of Beijing Midi Music Media, a new branch company under the school aimed at promoting young Chinese bands, auditions started in May 2017. They attracted more than 300 bands from 500 colleges across China, with more than 770 original songs submitted online. ""The bands are very young and dynamic. It's exciting to find out that they don't just perform rock but also other music types, such as electronic dance, blues and punk,"" says Yin, adding that the number of bands applying to the contest grows every year because of the school's reputation and its popular Midi Music Festival. The champions of the contest also get the opportunity to perform on the main stage of the festival. The company will launch music festivals at Chinese colleges this year and roll out plans to support bands on the campuses, says Yin. The Beijing Midi Music School, founded in 1993, is one of the first contemporary music schools in China. It has produced many of the country's rock stars, including the bands Miserable Faith and Escape Plan. In 2000, school president Zhang Fan launched the first Midi Music Festival in Beijing, where it became the first outdoor music festival of its kind in the country. The festival has since expanded into one of China's largest outdoor music events.,""Many band members started out as teenagers. It's always cool and popular to perform as a band on campus,"" says Yin, who formed his band in 1997 while studying at Beijing Midi Music School. Gentle Grape reminds Yin of The Flowers, or Hua'er, the former Beijing-based pop punk band, which was formed in 1998 and became famous as one of the first teenage bands in the country. ""Their earnest attempt to deliver the message of pursuing their dreams as a young band touched the judges,"" Yin says of Gentle Grape. The band's Li, who was born and grew up in Hohhot, capital of the Inner Mongolia autonomous region, learned classical guitar and piano in his childhood. He fell in love with rock music in high school. The song, titled Mi Tu Wei Fan, (""headstrong"") which the band performed during the contest, was written by Li in 2013 when he was a freshman. He set up the band with his schoolmate, drummer Chen Bohan, that year. The song talks about the summer after Li took the national college entrance exam in 2013. ""I was full of passion after I founded the band. But my mother, a primary school teacher, was not very supportive and we had no opportunity to perform. I was very lost but didn't want to give up my dream. Then I wrote the song in two hours during an afternoon in my dormitory,"" says Li. Despite the tough beginning, the band kept on producing original works. Influenced by US rock band Blink-182 and Canadian rock band Sum 41, Gentle Grape has gained a growing fan base with its pop, fastpaced melodies and upbeat lyrics. Center stage Many young Chinese bands are also engaging more fans with the growing popularity of social media platforms. In 2015, Gentle Grape band released an EP, including six original songs, through online crowdfunding. It planned to collect about 5,000 yuan ($800) in two or three months. More than 7,000 yuan was collected in four hours. On May 9, 2016, the band performed in a concert commemorating the 30th anniversary of China's rock music - Chinese rock fans mark the date because rocker Cui Jian, then 24, sang Nothing to My Name at the Beijing Workers' Gymnasium in 1986. Held at the same venue, the 2016 concert drew established Chinese rock stars and bands, including rock singer-songwriter Zheng Jun and rock band Tang Dynasty. ""My dream is to turn my passion for the band into a full-time job. If not, I'll find stable work to support my dream,"" says Li. Liang Qian, 26, lead singer of Mint Green, a pop band based in Fuzhou, capital of Fujian province, says: ""The contest is like the Olympics, with the battle of the bands. Qualifying for the final itself is a great prize."" The band won third place for its original pop song, Sheep, which Liang wrote for her ex-boyfriend. ""It promotes real music played by real bands, not just some karaoke contest,"" says rock singer-songwriter Wang Jiayi, based in Shenyang, capital of Liaoning province. Wang's band, Noble Man, clinched second place at the 2017 Midi School Bands Contest. All the members of the band graduated from the Shenyang Conservatory of Music.,Jazz singer-songwriter Zhang Ying, one of the judges of the 2017 contest, says she was impressed by the young bands' diversity and their wide musical influences. Unlike traditional rock bands, which are known for pouring out their anger and sharp views on social issues through their music, the young bands embrace themes of personal emotion as a way of addressing their authenticity and musical style, says Zhang, who is teaching in the music department of the Communication University of China. ""Earning a living as a rock band used to be a challenge. But it's no longer a problem now,"" says Liu Yujie, lead vocalist of pop-rock band, Monkey Legion, based in Chengdu, capital of Sichuan province. The band won the contest in 2012. In 2016, Monkey Legion performed on the stage of Japan's Summer Sonic music festival, the largest event of its kind in Asia. Last September, the band signed a contract with Beijing Midi Music Media and it is ready to release a debut album this year. ""We are open to various options and music is one of them,"" says Liu, 31, who learned martial arts as a child and graduated from Chengdu Sports Institute. His father bought him a guitar when Liu fell in love with rock music in middle school and he practiced for an hour before heading to school every morning. The other band members, including guitarist Chang Xiangyu and drummer Yang Rui, all graduated from the Sichuan Conservatory of Music and have other jobs, such as opening a music training school and practicing architecture. Liu himself owns a martial arts training school in Chengdu. ""For us, forming a band in college was about our passion. The process of writing a song and performing it onstage is still very exciting,"" says Liu."
0,"A Botswanan Sinologist shares his story of how he gave up studying computers in favor of a language. When Gracious Masule introduces himself, he always remembers to mention his Chinese name ""Ma Yinan"" and his ""Chinese hometown"" - Changsha, the capital of Central China's Hunan province. The Botswanan Sinologist, who is a Chinese language teacher at the University of Botswana, speaks fluent Chinese and has good understanding of Chinese society. Masule is one of the foreign scholars invited to the ongoing Beijing Class of the 2018 Visiting Program for Young Sinologists, which kicked off on July 6 in Beijing and will last for three weeks. The program has brought together 38 Sinologists from 34 countries for research and study at several institutes in Beijing. The program, which was started by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism in 2014, aims to strengthen cultural exchanges and set up a platform for young Sinologists worldwide to communicate and learn more about Chinese culture and history. Masule applied to the program after hearing about it at the Chinese embassy in Botswana. Masule and other young Sinologists will attend lectures by Chinese scholars, and conduct research at academic organizations or universities, including Peking University, over the next two weeks. They will then visit Guizhou province in Southwest China to learn about its ethnic culture and eco-civilization practices. ""I am very glad that I have been given this rare opportunity. For me, the main purpose of it is to learn more about Chinese culture and history,"" says Masule, 33. Masule says his love affair with China began when he was a college student. In 2009, he was working as a teaching assistant at the University of Botswana after graduating with a computer science degree. ""I thought I'd be a teacher, and then a professor, in the computer science department,"" he says. ""However, all that changed after an encounter with Chinese."" At that time, the Confucius Institute based in his university started to recruit students in Botswana. And Masule, who wanted to better communicate with his Chinese friends and their families back then, signed up. After less than half a year of study at the institute, Masule's Chinese language skills improved dramatically. And even his teachers were impressed by his ability to learn the language so quickly. ""I was encouraged then felt grateful when I received a certificate from the Chinese ambassador. I fell in love with Chinese and wanted to go to China to learn more,"" he says. In 2011, he applied for a scholarship and came to study for his master's degree in computer science at Hunan University in Changsha. Describing his experiences there, he says he found the local people friendly and was able to make friends easily. They were also curious about his ability to speak such good Mandarin. He was even invited to visit and stay at his friends' homes in places outside Changsha. When he later studied in Shanghai, he'd still go back to Hunan to spend the Spring Festival holiday with his ""Chinese families"" there every year. ""I feel Hunan is my hometown in China. And now I always tell people that I come from Hunan."" Masule also says that the three years he spent in Hunan changed his career path. ""Although I was busy studying computer science, I never gave up learning Chinese,"" he says. And when he realized that it was impossible to do both computer science and Chinese as writing his masters' thesis for his major was too time-consuming, Masule finally decided to give up on computing and focus entirely on Chinese. In 2013, he passed the level 5 examination for Chinese and was admitted to Shanghai Normal University to study international education in Chinese. Then, in 2015, he was recommended by his department to participate in the ""Confucius Institute Cup"" Chinese teaching competition held in Beijing, where he won the first prize. He returned to Botswana after graduating in 2016, and became the third Chinese teacher at the University of Botswana, which has a number of projects with China, including a department of Chinese set up in 2011. ""My dream of becoming a Chinese teacher has come true,"" he says. ""I enjoy sharing what I know with others."" Although his teaching schedule is packed due to a lack of teachers, Masule enjoys his work. ""I like Chinese and I also like teaching Chinese to students. Studying Chinese has opened a wonderful door in my life,"" he says, adding that he plans to return to China for further study and carry out more research on the Chinese language. After returning to his home country, Masule sees himself as a bridge between China and Botswana. ""I hope that by studying the language, I can help the Botswanan and Chinese peoples grow closer and better understand each other,"" says Masule, who often hosts activities to spread Chinese culture in Botswana and is often invited to anchor events hosted by the Chinese embassy in Botswana. Last year, Masule married a Chinese woman, whom he met when studying in Shanghai, and the two now live in Botswana."
0,"Owing to a paucity of high-quality education options in China, parents with young children tend to become anxious in May. That's when the fate of school and junior high school admission applications in major Chinese cities is decided. The struggle for a school seat can get fierce. Many parents are willing to pay big money to buy a home in the neighborhood of their child's school, particularly if it happens to be a reputable institution. Many parents I know started their house-hunts both overseas and in China very early. Qin Hao, a father of two boys, spent more than 10 million yuan ($1.4 million) to buy a 200-square-meter duplex apartment in Pudong New Area of Shanghai in 2014, which allows his kids to go to a well-known public primary school in the district. His older son will enter primary school next year; his younger son will enter kindergarten in September. Chen Xuan, mother of an 11-month-old baby girl, started her preparations to buy a home even before she got married. She spent 3 million yuan to buy a 60-sq-m flat in Shanghai for her future baby's education five years ago. ""In the past year, home prices in Shanghai districts with schools did not rise to sensational levels. This was probably because the school admissions policy changed,"" said Lu Wenxi, a researcher with property consultancy Centaline Shanghai. In Shanghai, local education policy was altered to require parents to choose between public schools and private schools at the application stage itself. Those deciding to apply for private schools will forego their opportunity to admit their children in premium public schools even if their home is located in a school district. According to Lu, the average price of flats in school districts is getting more rational and more acceptable, up by 15 percent to 20 percent compared to similar homes in other localities without schools. In Beijing, even inhabitable flats commanded very high prices in the market not very long ago because of their proximity to schools. In many districts of Beijing, local public schools have digitalized their admissions process. This meant that a kid could no longer enroll into the school by merely invoking old rules. In the past, a student was entitled to a seat in a school nearest to his or her home, according to a report in China Economic Net. Chu Chaohui, a researcher at the National Institute of Education Sciences, suggested that in order to make the new policy more effective, the quality of education offered by various public schools within the same district should improve. The central government asked 12 cities other than Beijing and Shanghai to carry out a trial rental housing equality scheme in 2017. The idea was to ensure more balance in the way local educational resources were accessed by children from families that owned local homes and others from families who rented them. Such measures may have eased long-standing concerns relating to children's education. But, as Xu Yan, an education researcher with Beijing Normal University, stated, the fundamental reason for the fierce competition for admission into high-quality schools is the insufficient good-quality educational resources. This factor has been stoking Chinese parents' anxiety. So, part of the solution to home woes lies in increasing quality schools, he said."
1,"The central government and local authorities will accelerate planning for the Xiongan New Area, the country's top economic planner said on Tuesday. In addition, those governments will provide policy and financial support for key projects and budgeting, said He Lifeng, minister of the National Development and Reform Commission. A master blueprint of the new area, overall and detailed blueprints of the initial area and a plan on ecological conservation of the Baiyangdian region, are among the first plans to be mapped out, He told Xinhua News Agency. The commission will guide the Hebei provincial government and authorities as they draft these plans to ensure they meet the high standards of quality needed for the project, He said. ""Apart from having world-class urban planning, the architecture in the new area will also showcase Chinese cultural characteristics,"" He said. ""We'll also give support to major transportation, ecology, water conservation, energy and public service projects in the new area,"" he said. The central leadership announced on Saturday a historic decision to establish the Xiongan New Area in Hebei province as part of measures to advance the coordinated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. The new area, similar to the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone and the Shanghai Pudong New Area, is of national significance and ""crucial for the millennium to come"", according to an official circular. The area includes Xiongxian, Rongcheng and Anxin counties and their surrounding areas. It will eventually expand from the initial 100 to 2,000 square kilometers. He said the site of the new area was carefully chosen, See New area, ""based on practicality, and after rounds of comparison and rigorous research by experts"". The new zone has convenient transportation options; Beijing, Tianjin and Shijiazhuang are all within a half-hour's commute, He said. The zone is ecologically healthy and has a relatively strong environmental capacity as it is home to Baiyangdian Lake, northern China's largest freshwater lake. The relatively less-developed economy in the region also offers developers plenty of room, He said. He said the new zone will also take over many of Beijing's noncapital functions, thus becoming the other wing that complements Beijing's Tongzhou district, which has been designated as a subcenter of Beijing municipality. Beijing's population has reached more than 21 million, creating urban problems such as traffic congestion and overburdened public resources. The root of these issues lies in the capital taking on too many noncapital functions, He said. A development plan for Beijing has made clear it will be the center of politics, culture, international exchange, technology and innovation the core functions of the capital. He said another major task of the Xiongan area is to promote Hebei's economic and social development and help develop the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region into a world-class metropolitan area. The new area, along with Zhangjiakou－where the 2022 Winter Olympics will be held－will become two driving forces for Hebei's development, He said. People's Daily, the official newspaper of the Communist Party of China, said in an opinion piece posted on its WeChat social media account that the intention in building the new area is not to relocate the capital or to build another capital subcenter. ""It's to accommodate urban functions distributed from Beijing ... including administrative and public agencies, company headquarters, financial institutions, colleges and scientific research centers that are not related to the core function of the capital,"" it said. Xu Kuangdi, head of the expert advisory committee on the collaborative development of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei, suggested that the construction of Xiongan New Area should focus on technological and innovative industries, and the region should attract high-end innovative talent and resources. Supporting policies have to adapt to local conditions, he said."
0,"BEIJING－NourEldin Mohamed Abdelaal, from Egypt, declined offers from a number of elite universities in the West and joined the Beijing Institute of Technology to study computer sciences in September. The 20-year-old had received multiple offers from universities in countries including the United States and Britain. The University of Cambridge also reserved a spot for him for his post-graduate studies. However, he said he was attracted by China's booming computer industry and decided to come to China for his bachelor's degree. NourEldin won the honor of ""Best Arab Young Innovator in the World"" in 2016 for his creation of a parallel network which exceeds the current internet speed by 32 times. ""China's computer industry is developing rapidly. I want to study here and find entrepreneurship opportunities,"" NourEldin says. NourEldin's decision to study in China is supported by his father, who worked for a Chinese automobile company in Egypt for many years. His father has made more than 20 business trips to China and says the country is a ""unique"" place. NourEldin came to Beijing in August 2017 to take a Chinese language course, but besides the language, he is also learning about traditional Chinese culture. He is now a big fan of Chinese tea and enjoys watching Peking Opera. After class on his first day at BIT, he went to Lao She Teahouse and watched a Peking Opera show with his dad. He likes the costumes and the singing. ""The high-pitched tunes are like a nightingale singing,"" he says.,After living in China for a year, NourEldin has fallen in love with Chinese cuisine. He can now cook Chinese braised eggplant, and he loves Chinese noodles, with his favorite dishes being braised beef noodles and Lanzhou ramen. ""Chinese culture made my life in Beijing more colorful and helped me to see the world from a different perspective,"" says NourEldin. His interest in Chinese culture is shared by his classmates. Kembabazi Barbara, a 21-year-old half-Chinese half-Ugandan, says the Spring Festival celebration is her favorite time of the year when all her family members sit around the table to eat. Her Ugandan father met her mother when they were studying at Huazhong University of Science and Technology in central China's Hubei province. ""I feel close to China because of my half-Chinese identity,"" she says. Every two or three years, her mother used to travel with Kembabazi to her hometown in Hubei province, visiting places like the Shennongjia Natural Reserve and the Three Gorges Dam. The Ugandan is a tai chi fan. She learned the art from her grandfather and won the first prize for her part in a tai chi group at the Xuzhou China International Wushu Competition in May. At the start of BIT's new semester, she was happy to pick up a weekly tai chi course. ""Chinese tai chi is famous in Uganda. It can help people maintain balance and remain tranquil in difficult situations,"" she says. Kembabazi enjoys the convenience of Beijing's modern lifestyle, riding shared bikes around the campus, shopping using mobile payment apps and exploring places in the city with her smartphone. ""I want to take technology from China to Uganda and make life in Uganda more convenient,"" she says. According to the Ministry of Education, 61,594 African students were on campus in Chinese universities, research institutions and other educational institutions in 2016, up 23.7 percent year on year, and representing 13.91 percent of total international students in China.,The ministry's statistics show that China now offers 43,000 training programs, over 20,000 governmental scholarships and more than 1,300 degree programs to students from African countries. Sovi-guidi W. Lionnel Pyrrhus, 23, from the Republic of Benin, is pursuing his master's degree in Teaching Chinese as a Foreign Language at Beijing Language and Culture University. Lionnel Pyrrhus started learning Chinese at the Confucius Institute at the University of Abomey-Calavi in 2014. Last year, he took part in the 16th ""Chinese Bridge"" Chinese Proficiency Competition where he bagged the second prize for the Africa region. His motivation to learn Chinese came from his fascination with kung fu. When he was young he used to watch a lot of movies and TV series featuring the Chinese martial art, and was especially impressed by Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan and Jet Li. ""I have been fascinated with kung fu ever since I was little, and my father told me that if I wanted to know a country, I needed to learn its language first,"" he says. He dreams of becoming a Chinese teacher in Benin. ""I want to take Chinese language and culture to Benin,"" Lionnel says."

1,"China has terminated anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigations into imported sorghum from the United States, as domestic farmers have had difficulties selling pork products due to lower prices, the Ministry of Commerce announced on Friday. The ministry said it found prices of domestic pork products had declined, affecting the livelihoods of many farmers. Under such circumstances, it is not in the public interest to level a trade investigation on sorghum imports from the US, which can be used to formulate animal feed. The government will also return temporary antidumping deposits collected at Chinese customs, the ministry said in a statement. To protect domestic industry from dumping activities, China began to impose provisional anti-dumping measures on sorghum imported from the US from April 18. Importers of the product were required to pay deposits on the value of the shipments upon arrival, at a rate of 178.6 percent. ""China's decision is based on domestic pig farmers' interests,"" said Ding Lixin, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences in Beijing. He said sorghum became a hot crop in China after the country banned corn imports from the US in 2013; corn imports resumed in 2014. Because of price differences between domestic and overseas markets, Ding said many animal feed companies began to use cheaper imported corn, sorghum, barley and distiller's dried grains in 2012 and many of them now rely heavily on foreign shipments to control operating costs, especially in the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, and Guangdong and Fujian provinces. Sorghum produced in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region can be sold for about 3,000 yuan ($471) per metric ton, while the price of US sorghum was between 1,700 yuan and 1,800 yuan per ton in April, data from National Grain and Oils Information Center show. The US surpassed Australia to become China's biggest sorghum supplier in 2014, and its sorghum exports to China surged from 317,000 tons in 2013 to 4.76 million tons in 2017, data from the Ministry of Commerce show. China must accelerate the pace of supply-side structural reform in the agricultural sector, as it can effectively guarantee supply and increase farmers' incomes, with a focus on improving the quality of agricultural supplies, said Chen Jie, a researcher at the research center for the rural economy of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs. More than 80 percent of all US sorghum exports go to China, according to the US Grains Council. In addition to feeding cattle, sorghum is also used as an ingredient in the strong Chinese liquor, baijiu - bringing US farmers about $1 billion each year from China. Kansas, Texas, Colorado, Oklahoma and Nebraska were the top five states for sorghum production in the US last year."

1,"The top transport authority has urged Beijing-based Ofo, the cash-strapped bike-sharing platform, to refund customer deposits smoothly and quickly, but also called for the public to have more tolerance for the new industry. Wu Chungeng, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, said at a news conference on Friday: ""The ministry is urging the company to smooth channels to return deposits and speed up refund procedures to protect the legitimate rights and interests of users."" As of Friday, Ofo has received more than 11 million online applications for refunds. Thousands of angry users have lined up in clusters at the company's Beijing headquarters in recent days due to the company's stalling on deposit refunds online, eager to know whether and when they will get their deposits back. To rent shared bikes, early users were asked to pay a 99-yuan ($14) deposit fee, which was later raised to 199 yuan. The total scale of refunds will amount to more than 1 billion yuan. The ministry required Ofo to cut costs and increase profits and enhance the sustainable development ability of the company. ""The ministry will also closely follow up on the case with related departments,"" Wu added. Ofo founder Dai Wei was issued ""consumption restrictions"" by a court in Beijing on Dec 4, which means Dai has been prohibited from any high-end consumption and nonnecessities of life and work, due to the failure by him and Ofo to pay debts to logistic companies, bike manufacturers and other service providers. The items include first-class seats on a range of modes of transport, luxury hotels, real estate, renting high-end office buildings, and seats on bullet trains. But Wu also said on Friday that the rapid development of shared bikes in recent years has provided a convenient choice for the public to travel short-distances and has played a positive role in building the urban green transportation system. According to official statistics, over 10 million shared bicycles were used nationwide each day, which still shows a high demand for the industry. ""In the process of developing new business, we hope the public can treat it rationally and have more tolerance and encouragement,"" Wu said, adding that it is necessary to give them room for trial and error, so as to create a positive environment for innovation."
0,"The Palace Museum and Cartier team up to host one of the cultural institution's largest shows on the theme of craftsmanship and restoration over the centuries. For Wang Jin and Qi Haonan, two restorers of antique timepieces at the Palace Museum in Beijing, their months spent in quasi-seclusion in 2017 at a watchmaking studio in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland, was a crucial period of exploration. They took six movements of timepieces dating back to the late 18th century to the mountainous town to work on their restoration with their counterparts from Cartier, the French jewelry and watch-making house. A documentary recording the project was released online last year. The Palace Museum, which is also known as the Forbidden City, was China's imperial palace between 1420 and 1911. ""The collaboration was not only a dialogue between the restorers but an exchange of techniques and expertise,"" Wang says. ""We worked together in a climate of utmost sincerity, overcame a number of challenges and accomplished our mission in full."",Their success also lead them to setting up a cross-cultural mission to celebrate craftsmanship. After the restoration, researchers from both sides began to explore the possibility of presenting a joint exhibition to showcase the splendor of timepieces through the ages. It has now expanded into a much wider plan, and one that doesn't just cover horology. Beyond Boundaries: Cartier and the Palace Museum Craftsmanship and Restoration Exhibition opened on Saturday at the Meridian Gate Galleries of the museum in Beijing. It places more than 800 artifacts dating from the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) to modern times on display, making it one of the largest exhibitions in the history of the Palace Museum. As a highlight of the exhibition, which is to run through July, the six timepieces-four clocks with exquisite decorations and two gold watches benefiting from the joint restoration-are displayed in Time Memories, one of three themed sections of the exhibition.,The Palace Museum is generally believed to hold one of the world's best collections of mechanical clocks from the 17th and 18th centuries, thanks to the wealth of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) emperors and their habit of ordering the latest timepieces from Europe. ""The level and quality of the (timepiece) objects from the Forbidden City's collection is just extraordinary,"" says Pierre Rainero, Cartier's director of image, style and heritage. ""It's even difficult to find their equivalent in Europe because many of them were destroyed over time."" Other precious timekeeping instruments from both institutions help to form a cultural dialogue. For example, a similar pair of gravity clocks from the collections of the Palace Museum and Cartier are presented together for juxtaposition. The clocks, whose movements are driven by gravity that makes them roll down slowly on an inclined base, both have to be reset by hand. There are also abundant exhibits of ""mystery clocks"", the signature objects made by Cartier where clock hands appear to ""float"" on transparent dials without any apparent connection to the movement. Elements of Chinese inspiration were also used in the decoration of these timepieces.,Speaking of ""beyond boundaries"", the theme of the exhibition, Cartier International CEO Cyrille Vigneron explains in an interview with China Daily that ""art is a universal language"". ""If it touches you, it touches you,"" he says. ""You don't have to put any words behind it... This exhibition is a journey through time, space and culture."" Echoing this idea, the exhibition's curators widened the scope of their search for artifacts to a broad range of countries and collections. Other than artifacts from the Palace Museum and the Cartier Collection, many of the objects came from other public institutions, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the National Gallery of Australia, the Qatar Museums and the Musee International d'Horlogerie (International Museum of Horology) in La Chaux-de-Fonds, as well as some other private and royal collections.,The Symbols of Power section of the exhibition displays tiaras, bracelets, necklaces and other items of jewelry owned by royal courts and celebrities from all over Europe, Asia and North America, which combine to present a sparkling fiesta for the eyes. An emphasis was particularly placed on presenting the rise of the modernist style of the early 20th century, marking the birth of the Art Deco movement and plotting the evolution of fashion. ""It's difficult to say where their home is because they are part of the patrimony of history and humanity,"" Vigneron says. Wang Yuegong, Chinese curator of the exhibition and director of the department at the Palace Museum studying royal life and imperial rituals, notes that it is a pity that they were unable to find a Chinese emperor in the Forbidden City who once owned Cartier jewels. However, this absence did not curb their creativity. ""Considering that jewels represented power in the West, we have to confess that there are boundaries between the different cultures,"" Wang Yuegong says. ""And that's the reason for mutual learning. These exhibits show visitors how the lines between different cultures can become blurred and begin to merge naturally."",His team spent months scouring the warehouses of the Palace Museum searching for symbols of Chinese power such as an imperial robe owned by Emperor Qianlong (1711-99), a gold imperial seal and chaozhu-beads worn by high officials during ceremonies at the royal court. ""Nevertheless, we can see that both the Eastern and Western traditions tend to reveal power through outstanding craftsmanship,"" Wang Yuegong says. ""That's an emotional resonance."" In preparation for the exhibition, Cartier also searched through its archives to reveal many of its lesser-known objects that have links with China. Oei Hui-lan, wife of Chinese diplomat Wellington Koo (1888-1985), who is best known for being one of China's representatives at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, stands out as a fashion icon for her refined tastes in jadeite. One of the many qipao (cheongsam) she once owned appears in the exhibition on loan from the Metropolitan Museum of Art.,""Since the 1930s, jadeite has emerged as a distinctive feature in jewelry that is sought after by socialites from the East and West,"" says Wang Hebei, a researcher at the Palace Museum. ""Ranked as one of the top gems, jadeite has become one of the few stones, whose supply, distribution channels and craftsmanship were firmly controlled by Chinese dealers, while the standards of appraisal were set out by Chinese jewelers and intellectuals."" Curators also found the first recorded Chinese customer of Cartier-Aisin-Gioro Tsai Lun. Coincidentally or not, this prince who bought a watch in Paris in 1914 happens to be the great-great-grandson of Emperor Qianlong, a major contributor to the vast collection of clocks in the Forbidden City. A similar watch to the one prince Tsai Lun bought is also on display.,According to Rainero, a passion for Chinese culture became a trend in the West during the 1920s, and fashion brands were quick to respond to the ever-growing demand. Chinese aesthetics and motifs influenced not only the design of jewelry sets, watches and clocks, but also the workmanship of specific materials, nourishing an entire process of creation. That period is also reflected in the section Chinese Inspirations at the exhibition through artifacts made of typical materials and patterns rooted in the traditions of Chinese culture. For instance, the Carp clock from 1925 was made of a piece of carved ancient jade depicting two fishes swimming in the waves. Carp is appreciated for its courage and tenacity in Chinese culture, allowing it to swim upstream and change into a dragon. Elements of Chinese culture seems to be ubiquitous in European upper-class life during this era, which are reflected in a range of exhibits, from a lacquer bridge case that was once owned by the well-known Rothschild family, to a platinum brooch and a vanity case featuring dragon motifs. As China continues to develop rapidly both economically and culturally, Vigneron says he believes that it is important to remind people of their own traditions through familiar artifacts.,""When it (the exhibition) comes here, it should be inspiring to Chinese people,"" Vigneron says. ""Sometimes you look at things more when someone else looks at it. It's important for the young people not to say (this is) something for the grandparents. They should instead be saying to themselves, let's be inspired by them."" Since it was established in 1983, the Cartier Collection has toured more than 30 major museums around the world, and now has over 1,600 artifacts, according to curator Pascale Lepeu. Other than Beijing, it has traveled to several other Chinese cities including Shanghai, Chengdu in Sichuan province, Shenyang in Liaoning province, and Taipei. Nevertheless, Beijing remains the only city in the world where the Cartier Collection has made a comeback. In 2009, Cartier Treasures-Jeweller to Kings, King of Jewellers was staged at the Meridian Gate Galleries. ""If you want to go beyond the boundaries of time, what can connect us with the past are objects of art or crafts,"" Vigneron says. ""Especially if you preserve them and continue to keep them in good shape through restoration ... they can provide us with a continuous thread.""

The visa center was established to boost cultural and economic exchanges between China and Turkmenistan, further enhancing their cooperation in various fields. In the past, trade between Turkmenistan and China was mainly focused on oil because of the former's abundant natural resources. With the launch of the Belt and Road Initiative, the ancient Central Asian country is also able to benefit from China's booming tourism market. ""Last year, fewer than 20,000 Chinese tourists traveled from China to Turkmenistan. There is huge market potential. The newly established visa center offers more convenience to travelers, serving as a bridge between China and Turkmenistan,"" said You Xiangdong, general manager of Beijing Shuangxiong Foreign Service Co, the operator of the visa center. You noted that the Turkmen government is very optimistic about the Chinese market. ""This year, three groups of officials from Turkmenistan's tourism bureau went to China to tackle the tourism market. We are now working on a plan to gather efforts from both Chinese and Turkmen governments and travel agencies to open up the market."" According to You, in the initial stages, the company plans to invest roughly 6 million yuan ($886,000) per year into the program, and leading travel agencies from China and Turkmenistan will also get involved. Xing Xiaoliang, a tourism analyst at Beijing-based internet consultancy Analysys International, said: ""The Belt and Road Initiative promotes China's outbound tourism to a large extent, bringing new destinations. Many travel agencies have already launched related tourism products."" ""In contrast to countries and regions that are part of the Maritime Silk Road, such as Thailand, Turkmenistan, which belongs to the continental Silk Road, offers tourists different cultural and consumer experiences, fully satisfying their curiosity. ""For Turkmenistan, the infrastructure construction, products and services related to local tourism are at a primary stage. There is plenty of room for growth,"" Xing said."
1,"Lu Yan, a senior manager in a German company located in Shanghai's Jing'an district, loves everything about her job except for one aspect — the two-hour commute to work from her home in the suburban Songjiang district every day. ""Every day I have to worry about whether I can book a ride using ride-sharing apps,"" said the 37-year-old. Lu is not alone in her struggles. Others like Chen Shouzhen have even resorted to finding another job just to avoid the pain of long commutes. ""The long distance has compromised the quality of my life and work. I have to do everything hastily, I have no time for entertainment or study, and I do not even have enough sleep,"" said the 23 year-old who used to have to take three modes of transportation — shared bicycle, metro and shuttle bus — to get to work. Tencent and Penguin Intelligence, a research arm of WeChat's developer Tencent Holdings Ltd, recently released a report on the state of transportation in major Chinese cities which showed that office workers in Beijing have to travel an average of 9.3 kilometers to work every day, the longest distance of all cities in China, according to the Shanghai Observer. The second spot went to Shanghai residents who have to travel an average of 8 km. However, based on specific groups of workers, those who live in Kunshan of the nearby Jiangsu province and travel to Shanghai for work clock the most mileage at over 40 km. The report also found that 3.2 percent of the commuters in Shanghai have to travel more than 25 km to work. Yang Diange, a professor who specializes in automotive engineering from Tsinghua University in Beijing, said that connected vehicles and autonomous driving could be one of the solutions to this problem in the future. While such technology would not reduce the distance people have to travel to work, it would help to reduce the time required. One of the arguments is that autonomous driving will make public transportation more convenient, reducing the need for people to own cars, which in turn reduces traffic volume and improves efficiency. Other proponents of autonomous driving point out that sophisticated radar and sensor technologies would help to make driving safer. This would in turn reduce the number of traffic accidents and improve transportation efficiency. ""The self-driving car will not only offer a completely new driving experience, but also change the entire automotive industry...the goal is to let driving become safer, easier and more enjoyable with the ADAS (advanced driver assistance system),"" said Frederick Fu, president of Avnet Asia-Pacific, a global distributor of electronic components and technology solutions provider. Yang added: ""Public transportation will be one of the first sectors to apply autonomous driving. (With the help of big data and AI) transportation efficiency would be greatly enhanced. ""Autonomous driving will surely become a reality sometime in the future. It will be a result of the maturing of technologies, laws and regulations."" Li Qingwen, president of China Automobile Evaluation Academy, said that the greatest hurdle standing in the way of mass adoption of autonomous vehicles is not technology but laws and regulations. One of the biggest hurdles is accountability. With no one at the wheels of a completely autonomous vehicle, the act of assigning blame in the event of an accident becomes complicated. This aspect would also impact insurance claims. There are five levels of autonomous driving, with the fifth representing complete automation. Chinese experts expect half of the new cars in China to have a level one or two autonomous driving level by 2020. Experts also predict that between 10 and 20 percent of new cars in the country will be level three and four by 2025. By 2030, nearly 10 percent of the new cars will be level five. Between August 2014 and June 2017, some $76 billion was invested in autonomous vehicles globally, according to a new report from the Brookings Institution. Investment not only comes from major automakers like Daimler, BMW, Volkswagen, General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co, but also from tech players such as Intel, Apple Inc, and Baidu Inc. According to Navigant Research, 120 million autonomous cars will be sold globally between 2020 and 2035. Tests have already been launched in many states in the United States, and the breakthroughs in key technologies of autonomous driving will increase the popularity of this technology in cities globally, according to Yang. Guo Ren, associated director of research at Mintel, pointed out that major Chinese corporations and cities including Beijing and Shanghai are already working on paving roads for intelligent and connected car technologies. On March 1, China's first batch of car plates for autonomous vehicles was issued in Shanghai, allowing these vehicles to be test driven on a 5.6-km trial road in Jiading district. The road was recently extended to 12 km. According to the district's deputy head Lu Zufang, as many as 200 test sites for intelligent driving have been formed within the closed testing area. ""Shanghai is aiming to build a high-tech automobile sector that is intelligent and connected,"" said Huang Ou, deputy director of Shanghai Municipal Commission of Economy and Information Technology. ""Coming up with rules and regulations will be key to the automotive industry's ongoing transition."" The automotive sector in Shanghai plays a big role in the city's economy, growing 19.1 percent year-on-year to 677.4 billion yuan ($106.7 billion) in revenue in 2017, accounting for 19.9 percent of the city's total industrial output value. The city's mayor pointed out that Shanghai will become a national connected car innovation center with global influence by 2020. In December, Beijing became China's first city to release rules with regard to the road testing of autonomous vehicles. To date, Beijing has decided to set aside 33 roads with a total length of 105 km for open road testing. Before autonomous driving is widely adopted, there should first be a stage where regular vehicles and autonomous vehicles are allowed to operate together on the roads as this would allow the artificial intelligence technologies in vehicles to gather sufficient data, said Hendrik Lee, technical general manager of China with u-blox, a Switzerland-based global positioning and wireless communication technologies provider. This year, SAIC Motor Corp Ltd, the largest auto company on China's A-share market, is planning to release mass-produced cars equipped with intelligent driving technologies to help reduce traffic jams, solve parking difficulties and boost driving safety. Since 2013, SAIC has tested intelligent driving in closed laboratories, roads, expressways, underground parking garages and other designated areas. The vehicle testing distance totaled 50,000 km. According to Yang, China faces bigger challenges than other countries in applying autonomous driving technology because of its size and complicated road and traffic conditions. However, these challenges could also prove to be an opportunity, he added. ""Once China overcomes all the difficulties, its model can be applied quickly worldwide,"" he said. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has set a goal that half of China's new cars and vehicles will be intelligent by 2020 as wireless networks will be able to cover 90 percent of cars in major Chinese cities, and all cars will have access to China's home-grown satellite navigation system BeiDou. ""China has yet to become a leader in this sector, but it has surprised the world in many different sectors before,"" said Fu. There are about 200 million automotive vehicles across China, or 150 units per 1,000 people, which is much lower than 800 units per 1,000 people in the US and between 500 and 600 units in Japan and South Korea. ""The revolution of autonomous cars is approaching, and it will only come true with the joint efforts of the automotive and scientific sectors and related industries,"" said Li."
1,"BEIJING - Beijing has built 4,300 5G base stations in the city's urban core areas and iconic buildings, the Beijing Youth Daily reported Tuesday. As of the end of May, the capital city has launched pre-commercial 5G services in the administrative areas for Beijing's sub-center, the new airport, the International Horticultural Exhibition, test venues for the 2022 Winter Olympics, Tiananmen Square and the main artery, Chang'an Avenue. By 2021, the city's core zones, including the central business district, innovation centers and economic-technological development area, will have 5G network coverage, said the newspaper citing the municipal communication bureau. Beijing has delivered 5,983 5G base stations to three telecommunications operators at the end of last month."
1,"I checked in at a budget hotel along the North Fifth Ring Road in Beijing when China's top political advisory body started its annual session on Saturday. The hotel is a 20-minute walk from the Beijing Conference Center, where many members of the 13th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference are gathering for group discussions on major issues through March 15. Booking the hotel saved me the trouble of spending three hours a day in a taxi between home and the conference center. It also means I made a choice to leave my 11-month-old baby to a nanny during the days and nights while I am covering the meeting. In first-tier cities like Beijing, the typical monthly salary for a nanny who lives with their employer is about 6,000 yuan ($950), tax free. For a higher-skilled nanny with the experience of taking care of at least two babies below the age of 6 months, the salary is at least 8,000 yuan. I am grateful to my nanny despite her salary taking a large part of mine. Without her, I'd have to quit my job. As China has eased family planning restrictions to allow two children for all couples, a noticeably growing number of working mothers are hiring nannies or sending their children to daycare centers or kindergartens. The issue of preschool education raised the concern of Liu Yan, a professor of the faculty of education at Beijing Normal University and a CPPCC National Committee member. In an interview with me after group discussions on Sunday, Liu said a procedure should be established to negotiate and share the cost of baby care for children ages 1 to 3 among different parties, including the government, families and enterprises. In a proposal submitted to the CPPCC National Committee this year, she also called for pay raises for kindergarten teachers. Despite their professional training, most of kindergarten teachers are paid far less than nannies. The average salary of a teacher at private kindergarten is between 1,500 and 3,000 yuan per month. The teachers at public kindergartens who are hired through the procedures for quota restricted staffing at public institutions have higher salaries - roughly the same as the average salary of primary and secondary school teachers in the same city, county or town. But due to staffing quota restrictions, those higher-paid teachers only account for about 20 percent of all public kindergarten teachers, Liu said. ""The key to increase people's satisfaction with preschool education is to raise teachers' salaries industrywide,"" she said. Hopefully, her proposals will benefit preschool teachers - and, eventually, our children. Contact the writer at jiangxueqing@chinadaily.com.cn"

0,"The world's oldest classical music label will mark its 120th anniversary this year with a series of high-profile events, Chen Nan reports. Deutsche Grammophon, the world's oldest and one of the most renowned classical music labels, will celebrate its 120th anniversary this year. Among the international programs to mark the special year, the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra will perform a concert at the site of Beijing's historical Imperial Ancestral Temple, which stands just outside the Forbidden City, on Oct 10. Under the baton of maestro Yu Long, SSO will open the concert with a special arrangement of Chinese composer Liu Tianhua's work, Enchanted Night. Then the orchestra will perform German composer Carl Orff's Carmina Burana with Russian soprano Aida Garifullina, British tenor Toby Spence and French baritone Ludovic Tezier, before being joined by French pianist Helene Grimaud for Ravel's Piano Concerto in G major. Norwegian violinist Mari Samuelsen will then take the solo lead in November from neo-classical composer Max Richter's Memoryhouse, a seminal work of contemporary neoclassical composition in 2002. It will be the first classical music event to be held at the site since 1998, when it held a performance of Turandot, conducted by Zubin Mehta. ""I am thrilled that DG will start its anniversary year with a genuinely historic event in Beijing. It is sure to inspire millions of young people in China and give momentum to the rise of a vast audience here and across the world,"" says Clemens Trautmann, the president of DG, in Shanghai, adding that millions will be able to watch the concert on TV and digital media online. Speaking about the repertoire for the concert, Trautmann says the program brings together a wide range of music from different eras and from composers in different countries. He says the lyrics of Carmina Burana are from a 13th-century manuscript discovered in a Bavarian monastery and are thus from an era when the Forbidden City was built. Yu, China's well-known conductor on the international scene, and SSO have signed a contract with DG in Berlin, where it is headquartered, to become the first Chinese conductor and orchestra to join the label. Their first DG recording will be released in 2019 to mark the 140th anniversary of SSO, the oldest symphony orchestra in China. Speaking about the deal, Yu says: ""Even as we are announcing the news of the upcoming Beijing concert, the orchestra is working hard on recording its debut DG album."" One of the pieces in the recording will be Chinese composer Chen Qigang's La Joie de la souffrance for Violin and Orchestra, featuring Grammy-winning Russian violinist Maxim Vengerov.,The piece was commissioned for the Beijing Music Festival and premiered at last year's closing concert of the event. Another piece that will feature in the album is Rachmaninov's Symphonic Dance. Speaking about the project, Yu says: ""The album will establish a dialogue between Chinese and European orchestral music."" The idea of collaborating with Yu and SSO took shape when Trautmann met Yu at the Lucerne Festival in Switzerland last summer. Trautmann says: ""I believe that it is one of the most advanced and internationalized orchestras in China,"" adding that DG has been part of China's music scene for over 100 years, and that Shanghai was one of the first Chinese cities that opened up to the Western world. The history of the SSO dates back to 1879 when it was known as the Shanghai Public Band. In 1922, it was renamed the Shanghai Municipal Orchestra. And it was under Italian conductor Mario Paci that the orchestra promoted Western music and trained young Chinese musicians. Yu, 54, who was born into a musically-inclined family in Shanghai, studied at the Shanghai Conservatory followed by Berlin's Hochschule de Kunste. In early 1990s, Yu returned home and founded the Beijing Music Festival in 1998 followed by the China Philharmonic Orchestra in 2000. And he has been the artistic director of SSO since 2009. As for DG, its story goes back to the birth of recording. In June 1898, the company was founded in Hanover along with the first record and gramophone manufacturing works. And its director was Emile Berliner, the Hanover-born American inventor of both the disc and the player. Now, DG is a part of the Universal Music Group, the world's largest record company. As for the other events marking the anniversary, Garand Wu, the managing director of Universal Music China, says that besides the concert there will be three performances at Beijing's National Centre for the Performing Arts over Nov 18-20 by the Berlin Staatskapelle and the Israeli-Argentinian maestro Daniel Barenboim. DG will also introduce its project, Yellow Lounge, to the country with a performance at Beijing's Mao Livehouse featuring British-Irish classical violinist Daniel Hope, Chinese clarinetist Wang Tao and the Zurich Chamber Orchestra. DG's Yellow Lounge project, which aims to introduce clubbers to live classical music, was born in 2001 in Berlin's techno clubs. And since then, Yellow Lounge has organized over 130 club nights, each attracting up to 1,000 guests and a massive traditional and social media following. ""Yellow Lounge takes classical music to the younger generation. After Beijing we will take it to other Chinese cities,"" says Wu. Speaking about DG's future, Trautmann says it will keep alive the tradition of the label, especially when it comes to building long-term relationships with musicians worldwide and attracting younger audiences. ""The inventor of the gramophone and the founder of the world's oldest record label, Emil Berliner, brought music into everyday life. And we still use the latest technology to bring music to people."" Contact the writer at chennan@chinadaily.com.cn"

With support from organizations such as the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, the conference this year is jointly organized by a slew of organizations including the China Association for Small & Medium Commercial Enterprises (CASME), the Public Diplomacy & Culture Exchange Center, and the Beijing Foreign Studies University. Wang Min, president of CASME, said the association initiated the World SME Conference as a platform for SMEs worldwide to communicate and cooperate in response to the United Nations' decision in 2017 to designate June 27 as ""Small and Medium-sized Enterprises Day"". He said the SME Day highlights their important role in achieving sustainable development, promoting innovation and creativity, and providing decent jobs for all people. The first World SME Conference held in Beijing last year achieved great success thanks to its distinct themes, rich content and active participants, according to Wang. ""SMEs are the pillar of economic development in the world, and are also the most dynamic and creative enterprise group,"" Wang said. ""Building a community with a shared future needs everyone's strength."" The conference this year will focus on jointly building the Belt and Road Initiative and the international cooperation of SMEs worldwide, with forums and roundtables on related topics, and exhibitions and designed negotiation areas. There will be an opening ceremony, a main forum and numerous sub-forums, to promote multi-level communication and exchanges. Such forums and activities will include business matchmaking and negotiation sessions to facilitate cooperation, orientations from senior government officials of different countries and regions to introduce the latest policies, and speeches from scholars, industry experts and entrepreneurs that will provide insights and experiences on business operations.

0,"China Global Television Network broadcaster Liu Xin will engage in a live debate on the trade war between China and the United States on Fox Business Network on Thursday morning Beijing time at the invitation of Fox host Trish Regan. China Daily Li Yang comments: In a harsh criticism of Beijing's trade policies, Trish Regan alleged China's intellectual property theft steals $600 billion from the US every year on her program on May 14. In her program on May 22, Liu responded that the figure of $600 billion is an estimate by a non-profit organization that has not been verified by any other party and refers to the US' possible IP loss to the world in a year, according to the organization's report. Their scheduled debate will be the first of its kind between the two countries, and has attracted people's attention. In their programs and personal exchanges on social media, the two broadcasters have clearly shown they have different understandings of the trade relations between China and the US. Apparently, they will not change each other's points of views on the program. But the debate will provide the world, and the US public, with a chance to know more about China's stance, which has been overshadowed by the US' beggar-thy-neighbor policy on their trade frictions, thanks to powerful US media like Fox News. But a bigger picture that should be borne in mind is that the trade war between the world's two largest economies — if it continues to escalate as the US administration seems intent on it doing — will deal a heavy blow to the world economy and force the global supply chain to be re-adjusted, which will come at the cost of all countries, including the US itself. The zero-sum game mentality the US administration has long preached to sell its trade war plans is outdated and goes against the trend of the times. Hopefully, Thursday's debate can help the US public understand there is another side to the coin."

0,"Male smokers are at higher risk of reproductive problems, including difficulty conceiving, abnormal sperm and partners who have miscarriages or deformed fetuses, according to a survey based on more than 4,000 male patients across China. For example, 16.6 percent of all males surveyed－both smokers and nonsmokers－had abnormal semen, including a lower concentration of sperm. But abnormalities were found in 32 percent those who smoked, according to the survey, which was released on Thursday. The chances of having a deformed fetus for nonsmoking males was 1.1 percent, but was 2.5 percent for smokers, the survey found. The survey covered 4,364 male patients seeking fertility treatment at 25 hospitals and clinics in 16 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities, including Beijing, Shanghai and Guangdong province. It was launched by the China Sexology Association and conducted by Peking University Third Hospital from August to October. Of the males surveyed, 99 percent were between 20 and 50 years old, with 51 percent who were smokers. Most of the smokers－60 percent－had been smoking for more than five years. ""The result of the survey shows that the damage from tobacco to male reproductive health is more serious than we expected,"" said Jiang Hui, director of the Andrology Department at Peking University Third Hospital in Beijing. Smokers' sperm is more likely to have abnormalities such as lower numbers and activity, as well as more deformities, he said. These may have resulted from the harmful chemicals in tobacco, such as nicotine, that damage human cells, he said. China is the world's biggest producer and consumer of tobacco, with more than 300 million smokers, most of them male. The survey also found that while more than 86 percent of the males understood that smoking causes lung diseases, only 43 percent of them were aware that it can also damage reproductive health. Liang Lirong, director of Beijing Chaoyang Hospital's smoking-cessation clinic, said quitting smoking is necessary to protect health, but most smokers in China try to quit smoking by willpower alone, which has a low chance of success. ""Many smokers fail to quit smoking because they did not find the right way,"" she said. ""We suggest addicted smokers try to use proper drugs with the advice of doctors to improve their chances of success."""

According to China Railway Corp, the national rail operator, a bullet train linking Shijiazhuang, capital of Hebei province, and Jinan, capital of Shandong province, will be put into operation on Thursday. The new railway stretches 298 km and has 10 stations. Trains will initially operate at a speed of 250 km/h, reducing the travel time between the cities to two hours and nine minutes, down from three hours and 47 minutes. It also links to the Beijing-Guangzhou and Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railways, according to CRC, which said the line will play a significant role in rejuvenating the countryside, boosting regional development and enhancing the economy along the railway. Also on Thursday, a railway linking Jiujiang of Jiangxi province and Quzhou of Zhejiang province will start operations. The 334-km line has 10 stops and trains will run at an initial speed of 200 km/h. It will link to the Beijing-Kowloon, Wuhan-Jiujiang, Hefei-Jiujiang and Tongling-Jiujiang lines to the west. To the east, it will link to the Shanghai-Kunming line and the Quzhou-Ningde line, which is under construction. The line will form a railway gateway linking the southwestern region, Central China and coastal areas. ""The new line will boost tourism and mineral resources development, promote green development and encourage construction of Poyang Lake ecological economic region,"" according to CRC. In addition to its increasingly intricate high-speed railway network, China is helping other countries with transport infrastructure. China issued an updated national railway development plan last month that envisions 30,000 km of high-speed railways by the end of 2020, when it expects more than 80 percent of big cities will be covered by bullet trains. By the end of 2020, rail travel between Beijing and most provincial capitals will be reduced to between two and eight hours, the plan said."
0,"An additional 30,000 preschool places will be added in Beijing to meet the rising demand, while supervision of kindergarten management will be improved to provide a safer environment for pupils, acting Mayor Chen Jining said on Wednesday. He disclosed the plan while delivering the Government Work Report at the opening ceremony of the first session of the 15th Beijing People's Congress. Chen said the city government will build more kindergartens with qualified facilities, reasonable tuition fees and extensive enrollment. ""The responsibilities of kindergarten operators should be strengthened, while the government must steer preschool education,"" he said. ""Meanwhile, parents will be encouraged to play a bigger part in the management of kindergartens,"" he added. Preschool education has been a hot issue across the city, while management and safety of the industry aroused public attention when a teacher at a RYB Education kindergarten in Chaoyang district was detained on suspicion of child abuse in November. After that incident, Beijing launched safety inspections of all kindergartens, and the Ministry of Education said it would push for legislation on preschool education to provide legal guarantees for the operation and management of such institutions. The shortage of teachers is another headache for the government and kindergartens. The government will boost the number of qualified teachers by adding 2,350 places at normal schools in 2018, and it plans to maintain that level for the next five years, according to the Beijing Education Commission. Li Xuewei, president of Beijing Union University and a member of the Beijing Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said his college will accelerate the education of preschool teachers. ""We enrolled 400 additional students with preschool education majors this year,"" he said. Zhu Min, another member of the committee who runs a kindergarten in Beijing, said the authority should consider giving subsidies to teachers at private kindergartens to boost their salaries. Xu Zewei, a deputy to the people's congress, applauded the move, saying he has kept his eye on kindergarten management for a long time. ""Authorities need to clarify the responsibilities and duties of teachers and principals to avoid passing the buck when accidents happen,"" he said. He agreed to establish parent committees or select parent representatives to supervise the daily operation of kindergartens, saying it will be better for children's growth.

Five cities – Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen in Guangdong province, Wuhan in Hubei province and Chengdu in Sichuan province – took part in the Earth Hour campaign and held supporting events, including photo exhibitions and eco-fairs. The theme of this year's campaign, run by the World Wildlife Fund, was ""connect to earth"", in order to bring attention to protecting global biodiversity. The Olympic Tower in Beijing switched off its lights, as did the Oriental Pearl Tower in Shanghai, along with other 20 buildings in the Bund. The Yellow Crane Tower in Wuhan also went dark, as local environmental groups and college students joined the annual bid to highlight conservation. At the Strawberry Music Festival in Wuhan, a lead singer of a rock band unplugged his electric instrument and performed the traditional Chinese musical instrument guzheng, or Chinese zither, to recognize the campaign. Lu Lunyan, deputy CEO of WWF China, said that the campaign will guide the public to think and act beyond just 60 minutes. ""We aim to make ecological and environmental protection and the future of mankind into a daily lifestyle, from attention to action, from action to habit, from habit to a culture,"" she said. Initiated by the WWF in Sydney in 2007, the event is held annually to encourage individuals, communities, and enterprises to switch off lights for one hour, from 8:30 to 9:30 pm on the last Saturday of March, as a commitment to the planet."

With the world's longest high-speed track in service, China boasts the highest number of freight trains with widest range of speed. The availability of such high-speed system has taken China to a whole new track.   Two high-speed trains of a new model called Fuxing, or Rejuvenation, were put into operation on the Beijing-Shanghai line on June 26. Compared with the other high-speed trains in the country that have been designed and built with foreign technologies to different foreign standards, the new trains use core technologies developed in China and are built to a unified Chinese standard. The launch of the new bullet trains means China's high-speed trains have now bid farewell to their follower status and embarked on a new journey as pacesetters.,The Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway has become the nation's busiest high-speed rail link, with an average of about 505,000 passenger trips taken each day.  As of June 29, a total of 630 million trips were made on this track- double the number of all rail passengers in the US. The line travels through four provinces and three municipalities by connecting both Yangtze River DeltaEconomicZoneandBohaiSea Rim, benefiting 26.7 percent of the country's population.,  China is also working on next-generation bullet trains with a maximum speed of 400 km per hour. They will be ready by 2020 for markets linked to the Belt and Road Initiative. The country's high-speed railroads spanned 22,340 km by the end of last year, accounting for more than 60 percent of the world's total. Some 1 billion passengers traveled by high-speed trains in China last year, more than half of the world's total.,Beijing-Zhangjiakou high-speed railway, a major transportation project for the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games, is expected to be finished by the end of 2019. The new line will link Beijing's Yanqing district and Chongli county in Zhangjiakou. The track will boast a speed of 350 kilometers per hour, and will take less than one hour to travel from Beijing to Zhangjiakou.,  One of the outstanding features of Chinese high-speed railway is that the train can run on various terrains, braving various climates.  For instance, Harbin-Dalian high-speed railway, the world's first high-speed railway operated at high latitudes and low temperatures, has been in service for nearly 5 years.  The 653km-long round-island high-speed railway in South China's Hainan province is also the first one of its kind in the world."

And among the pieces it performed was one written by Chinese composer Guo Wenjing, entitled Xuan. The show, organized by the Netherlands Embassy in Beijing in conjunction with the Beijing Midi Productions Company, the performances also featured a percussion duo from the Netherlands called Dorable. Slagwerk Den Haag, founded in 1977, has its roots in the Hague, and has maintained a close connection with the city. The founders come from the percussion faculty at the Royal Conservatoire in The Hague, and the ensemble is fascinated by sounds of everyday life as well as by ceramics that can produce sound. On June 16, the ensemble had workshops for Chinese students from Yanqing No.4 Middle School, the Central Conservatory of Music and Midi Music School."
1,"The ongoing International Horticultural Exhibition 2019 in Beijing is all about gardening, but it doesn't shy away from high technology that improves visitors' experience. To provide visitors with information services, ticket purchasing, parking, travel routes, introductions to scenic spots, medical services, performance arrangements and traveling tips, a mobile phone app called Expo 2019 was developed. It's like having a tour guide at hand, said Guo Ziliang, an official at the Beijing World Horticultural Expo Coordination Bureau, the expo's organizer. ""The app shows people how to conveniently and efficiently make their way through the park,"" he said. ""It also helps improve the park's reception capacity."" The 162-day expo, from April 29 to Oct 7, is expected to receive a total of 16 million visitors. The app, available in bilingual versions-English and Chinese-can be downloaded for free from online app stores. At the botanic park, one of the core areas of the expo, more than 100 projectors were installed to digitally recreate mangrove forests and the environment surrounding them: tropical seas, tides and beaches. With sound, light and electrical effects, the exhibition shows how mangroves, one of the very few vegetation environments that can survive in coastal waters, thrive in the tides and change their surroundings for the better. Tianjin resident Li Lingyan, who visited the park on Monday, was fascinated by the mangrove exhibition. ""Looking at the exhibit, it is as though I was brought to the seashore to see how mangroves grow in a tough environment. It was an amazing process,"" she said. "" I was totally thrilled, and I got to learn a lot about mangroves."" Near Gate No 5 of the park, ""a forest of lights and shadows"" draws crowds. Using a variety of advanced technologies-augmented reality, artificial intelligence, virtual reality and human-computer interaction-scenes are created based on ancient Chinese classics, such as the Classic of Mountains and Seas, in which mythical animals appear in forests, lightning flashes, thunder rumbles, wind blows and rain pours. Visitors can experience primeval nature in a part of the exhibition developed by the Beijing World Horticultural Expo Coordination Bureau and the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Automation. In addition, visitors can experience what it's like to ride in an autonomous vehicle. Three driverless vehicles developed by Baidu-two with eight seats and one with four seats-offer rides in the park."
0,"China has more than 120,000 supervisors monitoring every aspect of the country's 260,000 primary and middle schools, the Ministry of Education said on Tuesday. ""Through continuous efforts over the past five years, almost 98 percent of primary and middle schools are equipped with supervisors,"" said He Xiuchao, director of the ministry’s Education Supervision Bureau. There are 19,500 full-time and 103,800 part-time supervisors, who are mainly principals, exemplary or retired teachers, and parents, He said. ""In some areas, the supervising system has been extended to cover kindergartens, vocational schools and special schools,"" he said. The ministry will strengthen its supervision of kindergartens to deal with high tuitions fees, insufficient access to good public kindergartens, and safety issues, he added. Tang Lijun, director of Beijing's education supervision office, said the capital will intensify training of kindergarten supervisors, who were sent to every kindergarten to monitor and ensure education quality and child safety last year. Beijing is working on an evaluation system of the city's kindergartens, which is expected to be released and implemented in the first half of this year, Tang said, adding that the system will take charge of student admissions as well as kindergartens' grading and overall quality improvement. On Nov 25, a 22-year-old female teacher from a RYB kindergarten in Beijing’s Chaoyang district was detained for alleged child abuse, causing public uproar. The Beijing Education Commission later sent hundreds of permanent supervisors to the city's kindergartens."
0,"A constant temperature of 27 degrees, a water bowl that never freezes, a comfy mat, and no dogs allowed. Those are the amenities for felines in a neighborhood in Beijing's Shunyi district, where stray cats can loll around contentedly all winter, nibbling food and sipping water, safe from the weather and provided with love through an artificial intelligence platform. It is purrfection. Wan Xi, an engineer at Baidu Brain－the open AI platform of Baidu－had the idea of building a smart shelter for strays when he found a kitten huddled on his car tire in the winter of 2017. Winter is rough for stray animals, as they require extra calories to stay warm. Only around 40 percent of stray cats find enough food and shelter to make it through the harsh temperatures. Although volunteers offer water, food and even heating pads to stray animals, Beijing's freezing winters can turn a bowl of water into ice before a cat can drink. Many stray cats don't live more than two years. Those that are not neutered or spayed face more health problems and spawn more homeless cats. Chinese netizens have dubbed Wan Xi－he doesn't give his real name－""the most hardcore cat lover"" for building the AI cat shelter. The wooden box, 165 centimeters tall, is cozy with a small entry. Inside is a multilevel cat den with a scratching post, plush resting places, dangling toys and hideaways. The access control system features AI facial recognition technology. A high-definition camera on top can identify 174 kinds of cats and let them enter or exit as they wish. It has night vision to let in any ginger toms or gray tabbies wandering by at night. The camera can check cats for four common feline diseases, including inflammation of the mouth and gums, skin problems and trauma. It can identify a neutered cat by spotting its ear tag within 300 milliseconds. Once a sick or non-neutered cat is identified, volunteers get an alert on their cellphones and come to help. Wan said the facial recognition system was developed on Baidu's EasyDL platform, a no-code tool that helps users build customized machine learning models. The system was ""trained"" with thousands of images of cat faces. The temperature inside the smart cattery is maintained at 27 degrees, at which cats feel most comfortable and relaxed. It also has a ventilation system that monitors the air inside in real time. Wan said stray cats in the neighborhood are more nervous at first and just wander around curiously. After one brave mongrel made the first visit, others followed. Stray cats are often emotionally sensitive, so the door will not close the minute a cat enters. The animal will have time to get used to the cattery without being jittery. Seven or eight cats come to rest in the shelter every day. Wan hopes more smart shelters will be set up in the neighborhood. The development of artificial intelligence is helping Beijing's dogs, too. At the suggestion of the local government, AI startup Megvii developed a dog facial recognition system to help reunite owners with lost pets. Just as humans can be identified by their unique fingerprints, dogs can be identified by their distinctive noses. Xie Yinan, vice-president of Megvii, said the company has built a dog nose-print database with 1 million images to train the machine-learning model, and the system is expected to help improve the stray dog problem in the city. It is estimated that the population of stray animals in Beijing surpassed 1 million back in 2005. Homeless animals lead to public health problems, but poisoning and shooting them has sparked debate about humane animal control methods. Everyone has their own way to communicate with the world, said Wan. ""I believe that technology can make the world a warmer and better place."" Xinhua"
1,"Selling gourmet food to China isn't easy business, given the country's rich agriculture resources and profound culinary tradition. One winning recipe is to know local people's preferences and cater offerings to their palates while preserving an authentic taste. That's what drives Mr Apple, a New Zealand organic apple grower, to breed a special variety called Dazzle to quench the appetite of Chinese, who summarize the traits of the premium fruit as ""red, crunchy, sweet, and medium-sized"". According to Milli Wang, who represents the brand in China, the Dazzle variety is getting a soft launch during the China International Import Expo as the brand rides the consumption upgrade boom sweeping across the country's middle-to high-income earners. ""The color and flavor of Dazzle have been developed specifically for the Chinese market,"" Wang said. ""We hope to win more brand awareness and tap into a broader range of clients."" To have a more prominent presence at the expo, Mr Apple is joining a cohort of small and medium-sized New Zealand companies represented by Primary Collaboration New Zealand, a group that helps New Zealand companies with product launches, concept promotions and networking in China. According to CEO Kevin Parish, the purpose of the collaboration is to aid the New Zealand food and beverage sector - usually small-scale and relatively new to China - navigate the world's largest consumer market through concerted efforts, including marketing, training and resource sharing. ""The expo provides the perfect platform to support these partners while also offering the opportunity to engage with a range of potential new customers across China,"" Parish said. ""As a collective we are working with our existing Chinese partners and the New Zealand government to showcase our natural and healthy food and beverage brands at the expo."" LandCorp Farming, a government-owned enterprise in New Zealand, will use the expo as a springboard for the debut of its dairy products in China. Jerry Liu, who represents the brand in China, said he believed the fair would ""bring in potential clients across the country and help forge long-term relationships"". Silver Fern Farms, a processor and marketer of meat products, is looking to promote the concept of chilled beef by displaying a wide range of natural, grass-fed red meat products that are generally leaner and higher in key nutrients. Claire Tan, who is responsible for marketing the brand in China, said a signing ceremony with a key partner is scheduled during the expo, and that the company is on course to penetrate deeper into retail channels as local consumers are willing to pay a premium for quality. Also seeking to seal new deals is Rockit, which sells miniature apples in select online marketplaces and high-end retail chains. Eric Dai, who represents the brand in China, said a meeting will be held with JD, one of China's leading e-retailers, during the expo as part of the company's effort to add two new distributors by year-end. About 90 New Zealand companies participated in the six-day fair, according to Damon Paling, trade commissioner of New Zealand Trade and Enterprise. Meanwhile, a two-week New Zealand Week kicked off on Nov 1 across seven major cities, including Beijing and Shanghai, displaying a wide range of specialties from the country."
1,"Online food apps are changing everyday life for Zhou Huan, a 25-year-old worker from Beijing, as all her meals can be brought by deliverymen no matter where she is. But recently she was even more pleased when an unmanned vehicle delivered her meal directly to a shopping mall in Beijing. ""You know what? I was so surprised when a robot approached me and said clearly that the food had arrived,"" Zhou said. The intelligent machine was developed by Meituan-Dianping, China's largest on-demand service provider, to offer customers unmanned online delivery services. It is also indicative of the country's digital transformation. Major tech companies in the country including Baidu Inc, JD and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd have all found themselves in a good position to develop autonomous deliveries to back up their businesses. Together, they are driving a burgeoning online food delivery market in China where a total of 300 million customers like Zhou order food online through popular apps. Meituan-Dianping, a group buying and dining platform with 320 million active users and more than 4 million merchants, started trial operations of autonomous deliveries in the shopping mall, office building and university campus last year. The company's autonomous delivery car is able to ferry food such as drinks, fruit and snacks from a local store to the residents. Embedded with leading camera, radar and GPS technologies, it can also avoid cars and passers-by automatically. Recently, it also launched its autonomous delivery service in Xiongan New Area, as part of its broader efforts to accelerate the application and commercialization of unmanned technologies. ""We will implement autonomous delivery not only between buildings but also within buildings by the end of this year in some areas in Xiongan,"" said Xia Huaxia, head of autonomous delivery at Meituan-Dianping. By then, delivery cars will be able travel up and down in building elevators, without anyone having to push the elevator buttons for them, he said. Xia agreed that its service would continue to rely on its delivery staff to some extent for quite some time into the foreseeable future. ""Currently, autonomous vehicles will act as a supplement to our delivery staff, especially for late-night deliveries, as unmanned vehicles can work round-the-clock,"" he added. Wang Xing, CEO of Meituan-Dianping, noted that the Beijing-based company will promote large-scale operation of autonomous delivery vehicles by 2019. An industry analyst pointed out that the autonomous delivery industry is promising since the national online delivery market is huge. The size of the Chinese online delivery market exceeded 297 billion yuan ($46.5 billion) last year, which represented an annual growth of more than 65 percent and is expected to exceed 360 billion yuan this year, said an industry report. ""As such, major internet companies are scrambling to tap into autonomous delivery to bolster their competitiveness to gain a lead,"" said Yang Xu, a life and services analyst at consultancy Analysys. ""Emerging technologies including unmanned delivery will be the core engine driving its businesses in the future,"" he added. However, Yang noted that the commercialization of autonomous delivery remains a long way off and still faces some challenges. Before this can be achieved, a number of problems including complicated road conditions, technological bottlenecks, operating costs and supervision need to be dealt with, said Yang, adding that related rules and regulations have yet to be issued. ""Autonomous delivery is never easy. We will continue to join forces with different partners to jointly develop technologies needed for unmanned delivery vehicles,"" said Wang Huiwen, co-founder and senior deputy president of Meituan-Dianping. ""We hope to accelerate the rollout of unmanned delivery in the country in the near future,"" she said."
0,"Wang He, a blind pianist from the Ningxia Hui autonomous region, is busy preparing for university life in Beijing while his peers await the results from the national college entrance exam. ""My dream finally came true. I still can't believe it,"" said Wang, 20, who received an offer from the music department at Beijing Union University. He took required tests in general knowledge and piano in April as part of the school's special education program. ""The school also required me to pass piano tests at both the China Conservatory of Music and the Zhejiang Conservatory of Music. These tests exempted me from taking the national college entrance exam,"" said Wang, whose eyesight began deteriorating at age 2 after a severe illness. He said he attributed this opportunity to China's supportive policies for visually impaired students hoping to attend college. In 2015, the Ministry of Education and the China Disabled Persons' Federation jointly launched Braille versions of the national college exam, and gave disabled students more time to finish the test - with art school candidates given waiver options. Wang was in high school when he learned about the new test policy, and this inspired him to apply to Ningxia's Special Education High School - his first step toward achieving his dream of attending college. If he had not applied, he says he would likely have gone to a vocational school to learn a skill such as traditional Chinese massage, a common occupation for many blind people in China. Wang said his world became totally dark at age 10, which made it impossible for him to stay in his public primary school. His father, Wang Qiwen, discovered his son's interest in music, and hired two teachers - one teaching Braille and the other piano. ""I hoped music could light up his world and keep him company,"" his father said. At first, his mother Zhang Haiping read the musical notes to him so he could memorize them before practice. Three years later, Wang He learned to read sheet music in Braille by himself. ""He loves playing the piano so much and is truly gifted. He practices at least seven hours a day and passed the Level 10 piano exam in just over three years,"" his father said. While playing the piano, Wang He also kept up with his regular school assignments. In 2014, while enrolled at Ningxia's Special Education High School in Yinchuan, the regional capital, he took part in the China region category of the seventh UK Royal International Music Competition, held in China. He finished in first place. ""It was a surprise for me as I never thought I'd win,"" Wang He said. ""I hope to become a piano teacher after graduation so I can help blind children in Ningxia.""

""The competition venues in Yanqing will meet the requirements for holding test events in October, while other venues will reach the stage next year,"" Zhang, who is also vice-mayor of Beijing, said during a ""passage interview"" before the closing of the second session of the 13th National People's Congress. Management for those venues will be strengthened this year as a series of world-class test events will be held continuously there until 2020, he said. Starting in February 2020, he said, a series of 20 test events are scheduled, running through the first half of 2021. Seven of those will be held in Zhangjiakou. The 2022 Winter Olympics will use 26 competition and non-competition venues in downtown Beijing, Yanqing district in the city's northwestern suburbs, and co-host city Zhangjiakou in Hebei province. By the end of this year, the Beijing-Zhangjiakou high-speed railway and the Yanqing-Chongli expressway is expected to complete construction, Zhang said. Zhang sees 2019 as a key year to prepare for the 2022 Winter Olympics for both Beijing and Zhangjiakou as several important activities have been scheduled. The mascots for the Beijing 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games will be unveiled in the next half of the year, according to Zhang. Volunteer recruitment for the Beijing 2022 will also be launched at the end of 2019."
1,"China ranked second after the United States in an internet development index released on Monday that gauges six dimensions from internet infrastructure to application among 38 countries. China has the largest number of internet users and is the world's top e-commerce and mobile payment market by transaction volume, according to the Global Internet Development Index, published during the 4th World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, Zhejiang province. The findings are part of the World Internet Development Report 2017, the first such industry index China has compiled as a world-leading digital force, said Yang Shuzhen, head of the Chinese Academy of Cyberspace Studies. ""It represents the specification, standardization and indexing of President Xi Jinping's thought on global internet governance,"" he said at a news conference. The index takes a holistic approach by assessing the level of infrastructure, innovation capacity, industry development, internet application, cyber security and internet governance among economies with advanced internet conditions. The rest of the top six were the Republic of Korea, Japan, the United Kingdom and Singapore. Compared with other international indexes that rely mostly on one specific benchmark, the Chinese plan aims to provide a comprehensive picture of internet development so that countries can draw on each other's experience and make progress accordingly, said Xu Yunhong, assistant to the head of the Chinese Academy of Cyberspace Studies. ""What are often neglected in past trials are evaluations of total internet industry capacity and measures on internet governance,"" Xu said. ""China's experience suggests that both factors are crucial to a sound development of the internet that aims to serve the fundamental interests of the people."" During last year's gathering in Wuzhen, Xi put forward four goals for the healthy development of cyberspace: promoting equality and mutual respect, being innovative, continually opening-up and sharing, and safeguarding its security and orderly development. The report urged countries to join hands to expand communications, safeguard the order of cyberspace and formulate governance rules. Also unveiled at the conference is a sister report that scans and analyzes internet development inside China, a country that saw 30.3 percent of its GDP come from the digital economy last year. Guangdong, Beijing, Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Shanghai are rated among the top five places where internet is being applied to invigorate economic vibrancy and innovate in social governance. Government agencies have had a digital makeover, with 27 out of 31 provinces, autonomous regions and provincial-level municipalities having established e-government service platforms by the end of last year, according to the research. A total of 170,000 government Weibo accounts and 514,000 WeChat public accounts had been set up by June 2017 to enhance transparency and facilitate interaction between the public sector and the people. Zhejiang province utilizes mobile internet, big data and facial recognition technologies for frictionless and secure transactions in public services, so that citizens run an errand ""no more than once"", said Che Jun, Party chief of Zhejiang. ""China's goal of internet development is not to nourish a handful of companies and groom them into giants or unicorns,"" said Shen Yi, head of the Cyberspace Governance Research Center at Fudan University. ""Instead, we strive to give dividends to the vast number of internet users through internet products and services that are affordable, premium and secure."""
0,"China will extend its supervisory system for primary and secondary schools to also cover preschools and kindergartens, a move designed to further monitor and ensure young students' safety, security and educational quality, the Ministry of Education said on Tuesday. The ministry will strengthen its supervision over preschools and kindergartens to deal with high tuitions fees, insufficient access to good public kindergartens and safety issues, He Xiuchao, director of the ministry's Education Supervision Bureau, said at a news conference. Tang Lijun, director of Beijing's educational supervision office, said at the conference that the city will intensify training of kindergarten supervisors sent to kindergartens to ensure preschool pupils' safety. ""Beijing is working on a comprehensive evaluation system over the city's kindergartens, which is expected to be released and implemented in the first half of 2018,"" Tang said. The system will take charge of student admissions as well as the grading and overall quality improvement of the city's kindergartens, he added. In November, reports of children at an RYB Education preschool being poked with needles and maltreated by a 22-year-old female teacher caused a public outcry. ""If such instances of child abuse could happen at high-end education facilities in the most international and developed city in China, what could have happened to the children living in second-tier cities and even in remote areas,"" one netizen wrote on microblog platform Sina Weibo. On Nov 25, the teacher, surnamed Liu, was sent to criminal detention, according to police. The Beijing Municipal Education Commission later sent hundreds of permanent supervisors to the city's kindergartens to inspect their education quality. The supervisors being assigned to each kindergarten had their personal information including names and phone numbers made available to the public. Li Guoqiang, a professor at Xiamen University in Fujian province, said China has seen a surge in the number of its kindergartens and preschools in recent years as the country intensifies efforts to popularize early education. ""Problems are inevitable as lots of these schools are privately owned and lack supervision,"" Li said. Local educational authorities should make the conditions of each kindergarten within their jurisdiction public so that parents have access to more information before sending their children off to school, he added. Efforts have also been made to strengthen supervision of the country's primary and secondary schools. China has more than 120,000 supervisors monitoring every aspect of the country's 260,000 primary and middle schools and 98 percent of these schools are equipped with supervisors, said He. There are 19,500 full-time and 103,800 part-time supervisors, who are mainly school principals, exemplary or retired teachers and parents, he added."
1,"Canon Medical Systems (China) Co, the medical equipment arm of Canon Inc, has set up a research center in China with over 100 laboratory technicians, and has plans to establish one more such facility. Canon Medical executives said they are driven by optimism that the Chinese market will offer many opportunities to further explore applications of artificial intelligence or AI in medical imaging solutions. They said demand for quality healthcare is rising among China's growing middle-income earners and a section of the population that is aging. Matsuoka Shin, president and CEO of Canon Medical, said the company, formerly known as Toshiba Medical Systems Corp, is seeking steady and sustainable growth in the world's second-largest economy. Camera producer Canon Inc recently announced in Beijing the official corporate name change of its medical devices unit, which was acquired from Toshiba Corp for 665.5 billion yen ($5.9 billion) in 2016. The Beijing-based company has the ability to enter China's medical market at a fast pace, by maximizing the combination of both its rich management resources in the local market and cutting-edge technologies like sensors and inkjet printing techniques, Shin said at a recent news conference. Since its establishment in 1930, Canon Medical Systems has introduced a number of leading medical systems in partnership with its customers worldwide. With its global sales and service network, it conducts business around the world, mainly providing diagnostic imaging systems to about 140 countries and regions. In China, Canon Medical has been enhancing efforts to stay at the forefront of applying AI in medical imaging solutions, said Yue Changhai, its senior vice-president. According to Yue, Canon Medical started to give priority to research and development as early as four years ago, and has set up in China a R&D team dedicated to AI. ""We are planning to establish another R&D and training center in China, with reach to Asian areas, in order to meet the research and clinical needs,"" Yue told China Daily on the sidelines of the news conference. The annual output of China's medical devices segment rose 13 percent year-on-year to 276.5 billion yuan ($43.98 billion) in 2016, according to data compiled by the China Association for the Medical Devices Industry. The growth rate of China's medical devices output was much higher than that of the global market, said Zhao Changshan, chairman of Zhongguancun Development Group. He made the remarks at the Design of Medical Devices Conference in Beijing last November. China has become the world's second-largest medical equipment market, followed by the United States, Zhao was quoted as saying by Stdaily.com, an affiliate of Science and Technology Daily."

Sleep-sharing capsules have popped up in Beijing and Shanghai recently, drawing immediate public attention. Primarily targeted at white-collar workers, the capsules have been mostly set up in office buildings. To use the capsule, people simply scan a QR code on the outside of each capsule and pay 6 yuan (90 cents) per 30 minutes during off-peak times or 10 yuan ($ 1.47) per half-hour in peak times.  But the capsules are now closed with employees telling customers that the capsules need to be upgraded. Dai Jiangong, who runs Beijing Xiangshui Technology Corporation that makes the sleeping-sharing capsules, said: ""We started to pilot the program from the end of May. We have not received any seal up notice or rectification proposals from relevant departments. It is the company that decides to temporarily close the capsules to communicate with authorities for long-term development considerations."" He stressed that the company has not officially launched the capsules but was testing them out and gathering users' feedback in Beijing. The sleeping capsule is not a hotel room or rental bed. It's designed to provide a comfortable space during noon break for white-collar workers in office buildings. ""So we are just open during work shift and closed at nights."" he said. According to Dai,the company will officially launch the sleep-sharing capsules after obtaining approval from relevant departments. Zhu Wei, a professor at China University of Political Science and Law and an expert member of the sharing economy committee of the Internet Society of China said the sleep-sharing capsules are not technically a part of the sharing economy, but a time-share lease.  ""Real sharing means the users rent out their own free rooms while sleeping-sharing capsule is not of this kind,"" he said. Zhu Wei stressed that operating hotels requires the approval of departments of industry and commerce, health and fire control, none of which the sleeping-sharing capsule has. He said there may be hidden security problems. ""There may be problems with prostitution, drug abusing, infectious diseases and so on,"" he said. In a hotel, the house keeper would clean up and disinfect the entire space when guests leave, but the sleep-sharing capsule dose not provide a cleaner each time.  Zhu Wei believes that the sleep-sharing capsule needs to get relevant qualifications to ensure users' health and safety."
1,"The shared accommodation industry should follow a ""platform plus"" model to inject new impetus in China's pre-owned housing market, said the co-founder of Beijing home-sharing company Xiaozhu during the Boao Forum for Asia in Hainan. 'Platform plus' is a reference to China's Internet Plus strategy to integrate new technologies, such as AI, big data, and cloud computing, in traditional industries. Chen Chi, also the company's CEO, made the remarks while discussing future trends in China's sharing economy with founders from other industry players, such as Booking.com, Grab, and VIPKid. ""The 'platform plus' strategy is to complete the missing links in the service industry chain,"" Chen said. ""Xiaozhu has been offering numerous value-added services, ranging from housekeeping, home interior photography to smart devices, so as to provide shared home users with a more convenient living environment."" ""According to our data, the demands for housekeeping and photography are growing fast. The house keeper with most orders on our platform earns more than 160,000 yuan a year and the best photographer can rake in 60,000 yuan monthly,"" said Chen. Considered China's answer to Airbnb, Xiaozhu has listed more than 500,000 shared houses in 650 cities and other destinations on its platform since its foundation in 2012. Many are fitted with smart locks, smoke detectors and alarms. According to Chen, with the Chinese economy entering the phase of ""new normal"", the sharing economy will face multi-layered challenges, including innovating its business model, adopting intelligent technologies, and offering standardized services. Advances in new technologies such as 5G and internet of things will bring huge potential for the home-share market, which is still in its early stages, according to Chen, who said that the company will accelerate its expansion to non-first-tier cities and rural areas. According to latest Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of China data, over 3 billion tourists visited rural resorts last year, which collected revenues of more than 800 billion yuan. To take advantage of rural tourism's potential Xiaozhu last year signed a strategic deal with the Tourism Development Committee of Hainan province to promote the rural homestay market while helping it alleviate poverty. ""The company will also further integrate its platform businesses with services including housekeeping, photography, house design and smart devices to boost a healthy, sustainable hospitality industry,"" Chen said."

The winter camp was regarded as one of the warmup activities for the 2022 Winter Olympic Games. The district’s tourism commission, the organizer, said children attended lectures about reptiles like lizards and enjoyed sledding on the snow. “My two children had great fun during the one-day event -- it was excellent,” said Feng Bing, a parent who participated in the camp. “Children could gain knowledge and get physical exercise as well.”"

It is the 24th Sam's Club store in the country. The new store, located at the center of the more affluent residential community in Shunyi district, was build with interactive experiences including Sam's kitchen, allowing chefs to showcase the cooking process based on food products available in store. Walmart has introduced the membership format in the country since 1996 in Shenzhen and now has about two million members nationwide. Last year, the retailer's revenue grew 8 percent year-on-year despite its small proportion of the overall market. Sam's Club's executives said earlier in an interview that it is the best timing for membership business model to flourish in China, proven by strong growth in consumer's willingness to purchase membership in music applications or retailing brands. Andrew Miles, president of Sam's Club China, said the club aims to serve middle-and-high-end income families in China, offering seamless online-and-offline services to meet member families' various consumption needs. The store offers both individual and business memberships and provides delivery services through its website, online application and partnership with JD. Sam's Club focuses on increasing the coverage and efficiency of its one-hour delivery service, which it operates through an alliance with delivery firm Dada-JD Daojia. The delivery service mainly covers high-frequency merchandizes including fresh food, maternity and baby products. In Beijing for example, it is expected to cover members residing within the fifth ring area. In addition to its current 260 yuan ($38) membership fee, Sam's Club has introduced a 680 yuan membership that offers high-end family services such as dental care at private clinics. United States retailer Costco, which also has members-only model, is reportedly opening its first mainland store in Shanghai soon."

In the gilt-trimmed lobby of Beverly Hills' historic Saban Theater, gold-tasseled red lanterns, emblematic of Chinese New Year, swayed above the capacity crowd that had gathered to experience a taste of one of China's most important holidays.  ""The best thing about this event is that it allows us to bring China's wonderful culture and traditions to Beverly Hills,"" said Julie Wagner, event chairwoman of the Beverly Hills Club.  ""It gives Beverly Hills residents a feel for what the Chinese are all about and of the beauty, history, art, and culture they have to share with us,"" she said.  For the last eight years, Beverly Hills has been honoring the Chinese New Year by hosting a special VIP celebration that's grown in scope and popularity every year. Last year, the demand for tickets was so great, the event was expanded to two days to accommodate the more than 1,000 attendees.  John Mirisch, the former mayor and now vice-mayor of Beverly Hills, said his city enjoys a great relationship with China.  ""We welcome the Chinese, and think sharing some of their interesting cultural experiences with American audiences right here in Beverly Hills makes us understand and appreciate each other more,"" he said with a smile.  Alan and Sandy Kroll, two local residents in their 70s, who visited China many years ago, said: ""We live in Beverly Hills and came out to support our community and revisit China.""  Since 2014, Beverly Hills has shared a close relationship with Beijing, and that relationship has grown to include Tianjin, the neighboring municipality, and Hebei, the surrounding province.  This year's Beverly Hills Chinese New Year was titled, ""Charming Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei"" in honor of the deepening ties between Beverly Hills and their Chinese co-sponsors, and included a photo exhibit from the three interconnected regions, plus demonstrations of delicate Chinese paper-cutting techniques and the ancient art of calligraphy.  The show itself featured a festive line up of traditional Chinese folk-dances, musical acts, Peking Opera, tai chi and martial arts performances. Relationships with prominent Chinese cultural organizations enabled the hosts to access top Chinese talent for the event.  Through the support of the Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei Associations for Cultural Exchange, the evening featured a stellar line up of Chinese artists, including vocalists Shan Dai and Yin Zhuojin, the Hebei Acrobatic Troupe, the Beijing Dance Troupe and the Girls Crystal Band.  Volunteers from the audience were invited on stage to learn a simple martial arts move from the master, to the great amusement of the audience.  One of the volunteers said: ""What a great night.

1,"Beijing, Shenzhen and Shanghai have taken the top spots as China's most innovative cities according to a report released by the Capital Institute of Science and Technology Development Strategy on Thursday, as reported by Science and Technology Daily. Guangzhou, Nanjing and Wuhan were ranked fourth, fifth and sixth, respectively. As urbanization in China has entered into a stage of quality improvement, the city as a key node of the global innovation network, is of great significance to the construction of an innovative country, said Guan Chenghua, head of CISTDS. The report, based on a people-oriented theory of urban innovation and development, constructed an index system of urban scientific and technological innovation and development in China, which includes four dimensions: innovative resources, innovative environment, innovative services and innovative performance. The list of China's top 10 most innovative cities is based on these metrics. The report found innovative service, an important means to enhance a city's innovative ability, is the core point of competition for the top 10 cities. Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin rank in the top three in this index. Talent, the cornerstone of the top 10 cities' innovative development, is the first key factor in measuring a city's scientific and technological innovation resources. In addition, the report said there is a high degree of consistency between innovation and entrepreneurship, which are new drivers of the top 10 cities' economic growth, and they integrated organically. The report provides a concrete analysis on Beijing's continued leading position in innovation. It showed Beijing, as a national science and technology innovation center, has further strengthened itself, ranking first in the three top-level indicators of innovation resources, innovation services and innovation performance. Suzhou, Tianjin, Hangzhou and Xi'an rounded out the list."

Research mapped the genes of 5,277 individual cells and identified 40 cell types in organs from human embryos, as well as the large intestine of adults. The research supported by the China National Natural Science Foundation was carried out by the Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Genomics (ICG), the Biodynamic Optical Imaging Center and the Third Hospital of Peking University, and published in the latest issue of Nature Cell Biology. Tang Fuchou, deputy director of ICG and member of the research team, told Xinhua that it was the first time that scientists had systematically studied the development paths and gene expressions of the oesophagus, stomach, small intestine and large intestine in both embryonic and adult stages.

The mini-gyms,also known as shared gyms, are garnering positive and negative attention among netizens. Each gym contains about five square meters of space and is equipped with a treadmill,a network television and an air conditioning system. Gym users can listen to music, see a film and check emails when running. The cost is 8 yuan ($1.20) for a 40-minute run. So far, seven Misspao mini-gyms have been placed in five Beijing residential. Users must download Misspao's app and register before using the mini-gym. Runners need to make a reservation,scan the QR code to open the shared gym's door, work out and when finished, pay with Alipay. Bi Zhen, Misspao's CEO, said his company's survey showed 95 percent of people need exercise but only 10 percent own a gym membership. So Bi's company decided to bring ""indoor sports"" to communities, offering a mini-gym at their doorsteps to satisfy sports enthusiasts' needs. Some people hold a positive view on this innovation. A woman told Pear Video after exercising, ""I ran for 15 minutes and felt comfortable to run in it with the air conditioning."" A netizen named Mingxuanruge noted the mini-gym is quite cheaper than a fitness center and it's also safer to work out in one's own neighborhood. A property management officer with the Zhongtaiyaxuan community in Chaoyang district said he's noticed that people in their 20s and 30s, especially women, like to use the shared gyms in the evening. A 39-year-old Zhongtaiyaxuan resident surnamed Han said the two shared gyms in his community are so small that he would feel uncomfortable using it and that he often sees many people getting exercise on the nearby basketball court while the mini-gym remains empty. ""Misspao can only provide runners a treadmill instead of other sorts of sports equipment and it's quite unreasonable to establish a gym without a changing room, a restroom and a shower room,"" Han added. Another resident named Zhang, who is in her 40s, thought this kind of gym may appeal more to younger generations rather than the middle-aged. Apart from Misspao, another shared gym brand, Douba, has offered two shared gyms in Beijing in July. Each including a treadmill or an exercise bicycle, cost about 20,000 yuan ($3,000).  Ge Jia, an internet observer, told Beijing Youth Daily he thinks the mini-gyms won't appeal to people used to the services offered at a full-service gym, such as showers and dressing rooms. ""And it will not work for long due to the lack of fitness programs and the high cost of ground occupation,"" he noted."
1,"Beijing released a new platform to further help start-ups transfer science and technology results to commercial and industrial products or services, local authorities said on Tuesday at an opening ceremony of a mass entrepreneurship and innovation week held in Beijing. ""We tried to use the concept proof plan to fill the gaps of scientific research institutions and the science market, aiming to develop scientific and technological achievements,"" said Yu Jun, Party secretary of Haidian district. It's also the first time that the local district released the plan in the country, as a way to further boost scientific innovation. By July 2018, the number of national high-tech enterprises totaled 8,992, occupying 40 percent of the Zhongguancun Demonstration Area, according to local authorities. The total revenue of local high-tech companies was 752.66 billion yuan ($108.77 billion) from January to May, up 17.8 percent year-on-year, or nearly 40 percent of the overall revenues in Zhongguancun Science Park. With the industry developing to high-end level in Haidian district, the total value was 144. 8 billion yuan, up 24.7 percent compared with the previous year. AI technology and big data have made substantial progress."
0,"Despite witnessing a decline in the publishing industry, Thomas Brinkmann still decided to publish a series of travel guides with the Beijing Publishing Group, which formed a joint venture with the German national in 2014. Brinkmann, managing director of the Mairdumont Group, which is headquartered in Germany, has visited Beijing frequently in the past four years and believes the capital still offers potential for book readers. ""When people are reading fewer books, it becomes more important to publish high-quality works to attract them back to bookstores,"" he said. ""The need for books always exists. (For example) if you want to check the opening hours of the Eiffel Tower, you will probably find them online, but if you want to know more about it its history and stories－you should read a book that is structured and integrated."" Similar to Brinkmann and his company, the Beijing municipal government is working hard to attract readers back to bookstores, one of the measures taken to build the city as the nation's cultural center. The authorities have set aside 50 million yuan ($7.2 million) in subsidies for 151 bookstores to support their development, the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Press, Radio, Film and Television announced on Oct 29. In the past two years, 36 million yuan has been invested to help operations at 140 bookstores, according to the bureau. A total of 80 new bookstores have been built in Beijing since 2016, and 11 of them are open 24 hours a day. By the end of the first half of this year, there were 1,011 bookstores and 29 book malls in the capital, occupying more than 1,000 square meters, according to the municipal government. October Time Bookstore, founded by a team of seven young entrepreneurs who have just graduated from college, is one of the new outlets. It is located in Zhongguancun in Haidian district close to several universities. Its founder, Fan Yingzhi, 22, said the aim is to build the store into an energetic and strong brand in both the reading and publishing sectors. After graduating from Beijing Technology and Business University in the summer, Fan and his team began running the store with support from the Beijing Publishing Group, which offered them the initial capital. The team invested 60,000 yuan and the company covered all the other expenses of about 1 million yuan, which included rent, decoration work and facilities. The team pays 10,000 yuan a month to the company as a management fee. Fan said the store began to make a profit－60,000 yuan－for the first time in April. ""For a bookstore occupying 100 square meters like ours, the profit was pretty satisfying,"" he said. ""The top profit in the market for a bookstore of such a size is about 100,000 yuan a month, and a large number of the stores are losing money."" To attract readers and remain profitable, the team tries to make the store different from others by innovating and providing various services. Coffee and food are available along with top-class tableware. The store is open round-the-clock and offers a quiet environment for students to study or prepare at night for examinations. Customers need to reserve seats at night because of the limited space, Fan said. ""Thanks to the support from the government and BPG, we can work on what we are good at. We have plenty of plans for our store, and we aim to build it into a platform for readers and publishers and combine online and offline reading in the future."" Qu Zhong, general manager of the Beijing Publishing Group, said it is a good way for the company to allow the young team to show its strength and talent by giving it a chance. ""This attempt has drawn wide public attention and good feedback, as the operations team is very innovative. It knows its target customers, who are also young people."" According to a guideline from the bureau, building bookstores will be included in the national economic and social development plan, with support for companies and individuals who want to open stores in commercial centers, tourist areas, on busy streets and in new residential communities. Zhang Su, deputy head of the bureau, said: ""We are not just helping out the bookstores with financial problems. Our goal is to use these policies to attract more social capital into the bookstore industry and guide existing ones to upgrade their operations."" Beijing plans to build 16 large-scale book malls－one in each district－and 200 niche bookstores in the city by 2020. ""The malls will become cultural experience centers for the public. They will not only sell books but also host lectures, charity activities and branding events,"" Zhang said.,Beijing is not just providing more and better bookstores for the public, it is making great efforts to offer improved content and a better literary environment. Last month, Du Feijin, a member of the Standing Committee of the Beijing Committee of the Communist Party of China, said at the opening ceremony of the third October Literature Month, ""Creating the best work is at the writers' core."" In recent years, Beijing has supported authors by setting up a special cultural fund to help them produce high-quality works, of which several have won national literature awards, Du said. Based on this, the Beijing government plans to set up two more funds－the October Literature Fund and the Network Literature Development Fund－to guide and promote the integrated development of both serious and online literature, he added. ""Meanwhile, the municipal government is facilitating the strategic cooperation between Beijing's cultural brand－October Literature－and the Alibaba Group, which will bring social and private investment into literary creation,"" he said. ""We've been working to keep Beijing's literary world lively and fresh."" In October 2016, the October Literature Academy was formed at Yongding, a park in the south of the city, and the first October Literature Month was held. In October last year, when the second literature month was held, the authorities, together with the Beijing Publishing Group, many bookstores and related groups held dozens of events such as literary forums, lectures, poetry readings, meetings between writers and readers, and book shows, which attracted more than 500,000 people. Online and offline activities involved more than 190 million people, according to the municipal government. Since then, ""October"", as the name of both the month and a magazine that has been published in Beijing for more than 40 years, has become a strong literary theme for cultural life in the capital. Last year, Zhang Luyi, a 10-year-old primary school student, attended a lecture at the academy given by A Lai, chairman of the Writers Association of Sichuan province, on the novel One Hundred Years of Solitude, by the Colombian author Gabriel Garcia Marquez. The boy quizzed A Lai during a question-and-answer session after the lecture, saying that his parents took him to such lectures regularly and he had read the book twice, gaining much inspiration from it. A Lai and other adults at the lecture were surprised that the boy had read this book at such an age, but the youngster said he loved reading and the city had provided him with many places to do so and with many reading activities since he started to learn Chinese characters. ""In the Chaoyang district library in my community, there are rooms especially for children to read books that are selected by the staff members, and the library holds a group book-reading session twice a day for children,"" the boy said.,Dong Jinxian, 58, who is retired and who sometimes attends lectures at the October Literature Academy, said she did not go to college when she was young and never thought there would be a chance to meet with well-known writers and listen to them share their views on literature. ""My daughter took me there for the first time and we listened to a lecture titled Dream of the Red Chamber given by Li Jingze, vice-chairman of the Chinese Writers Association,"" she said. ""I love the stories in that book (written by Cao Xueqin), but I didn't know there were so many interesting reading angles and anecdotes about it. The lecture was a fun and fruitful time for me. When I have the time, I like to spend it at the academy."" The institute has held 11 lectures on world-level literary works given by well-known writers or critics. It also stages various cultural activities. Li said during a literary forum last month: ""Literature is not just the writers' world. It's also a world for readers. ""Literature is not just about creation. It matters more about entering public life, the readers, the people, which will decide a nation's future. Beijing, as capital of the country, has accumulated rich and precious experience on this."" He added that the city is the cradle of China's modern literature. The capital and the writers living in it have been leading the way in terms of China's literary fashion, style and direction, he said. ""Thus, Beijing has its responsibility to the nation's literary development, which is destined to have a deep influence on the whole country."""

The city’s residents also top the rankings for food and beverage consumption in 2018, followed by Beijing and Hangzhou in Zhejiang province. According to the report, one Shanghai customer made 2,074 food delivery orders on Ele.me in 2018, the most in the country. Another Shanghai user spent a record 253,000 yuan ($36,900) on delivery services. However, the costliest order was made by a Beijing resident who spent 31,000 yuan on 74 hairy crabs. The report also stated that the utilization of delivery services is expanding rapidly across the nation, especially in the third- and fourth-tier cities, and that the number of orders exceeding 100 yuan in 2018 jumped 56 percent from 2017.

1,"Chinese college students spent a total of 685 billion yuan ($99 billion) last year, with each spending more than 1,400 yuan a month on average, according to a survey released in Beijing on Tuesday. The survey was conducted by the China Campus Market Association, a nongovernmental organization that bridges the needs of college students with company resources and products. It polled almost 27,000 college students from 2,300 higher education institutions nationwide. The survey found that three main things generally mainly constituted student expenditures. These were daily life expenses such as food and clothes, digital products like cellphones and laptops and finally, academic or skills training, including learning foreign languages. The survey also estimated that the so-called Engel's Coefficient－or proportion of food spending to total consumption－among China's college student group was 32 percent, which indicated a relatively high living standard. Survey leader Si Yaqing, a professor of the School of Economics and Management at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, said markets in the three spending areas still had a lot of potential waiting to be tapped, because China has a very large college student population. Statistics from the Ministry of Education showed that as of 2015, the total number of students at colleges and universities in China reached 34.5 million. ""They are active consumers, creating golden business opportunities for many industries and companies,"" Si said. Taking academic and skill training as an example, he said, the current market size was estimated to be no more than 40 billion yuan a year. However, as more students received training to be prepared for overseas studies and there are still 14 percent students surveyed said they have never paid to receive any form of training, it can be anticipated that the market will grow bigger in the future, Si said."

The 47-year-old is an inheritor of the Cheng school - one of four major Peking Opera styles founded by late opera master Cheng Yanqiu (1904-58) that emerged in the early 20th century. Though the 200-year-old art form has gradually lost its appeal to the general public in modern society, Zhang has performed sold-out shows both in and outside China, attracting audiences of all ages. Starting in 2008, however, she took an academic approach to pass down the traditional art. For 10 years, she has been teaching at the National Academy of Chinese Theater Arts in Beijing, a leading school for traditional Chinese opera.  On May 6, four of her students will take center stage at the Meet in Beijing Arts Festival to show the charm and inheritance of the time-honored opera form among China's younger generation.,will play Princess Tiejing in a scene from the opera  .

More than 80 shows, as wells as exhibitions and art education activities, will be featured in major theaters, art galleries and outdoor art scenes in the capital. This year is also the third time for Zhang Huoding to present her shows during the festival. In 2015 and 2016, Zhang closed the festival with her own performances. This year, however, Zhang will put her students under the limelight instead, to show how China's younger generation has stepped up to inherit and revive the ancient art."

It said winter sports resorts in Chongli had changed their business model and now provided services throughout the year. Zhangjiakou, Hebei province, will provide eight competition and noncompetition venues for the 2022 Games. It will host two sports, skiing and biathlon, and be home to 50 events in six disciplines: snowboarding, freestyle skiing, cross-country skiing, ski jumping, Nordic combined and biathlon. After the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics, China shifted its sporting focus from winning medals to promoting fitness for everyone, with the central government aiming to build a healthier nation by 2030. The 40-square-kilometer Thaiwoo Ski Resort, a major competition venue in Chongli, is one example of the change, having been developed into an all-season resort that provides not only skiing services in winter but also outdoor activities in summer. It welcomed 80,000 visitors this summer, reception manager Wang Xiaojuan said. The resort opened its doors in November 2015 and 30 skiing trails are scheduled to be completed by the end of next year."
0,"In 2015, the number of Chinese tourists to Israel was just over 30,000, while in 2017 and 2018, more than 100,000 tourists from China visited Israel. One of the key reasons for the increase in Chinese tourists to Israel is the introduction of direct flights between the two countries. There are currently direct flights from Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Hong Kong to Tel Aviv, with more direct flights expected to be launched in 2019. Israel has also opened visa centers in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, with one more due to open in Chengdu. The centers will promote and expand Chinese tourism to Israel. In addition, the Israeli Ministry of Tourism opened its second representative office in China in Guangzhou, with the first office already operating in Beijing. The ministry says that, according to the United Nations World Tourism Organization, Chinese tourists are by far the top spenders. Inside Israel, the ministry has taken steps to make the Chinese tourists feel more comfortable, such as bringing Chinese celebrity chefs to give cooking courses. Moreover, Israel has increased the number of Chinese-speaking tour guides, launched a Chinese-language website, and provided signage, maps and other materials in Chinese at major tourist sites. Also, many Israeli guides have traveled to China for the purpose of learning the language and culture of their potential Chinese clients. Furthermore, Israel will soon launch WeChat and Alipay to facilitate access to digital payment for Chinese tourists. Multiple-entry visas for up to 10 years are now available for Chinese visitors, instead of the previous three-month visas. The procedures are part of the measures Israel has taken to remove obstacles that slow down growth of tourism from China. ""Israeli hotels have made changes for Chinese travelers,"" says Zohar Marom, head of the incoming division at Amsalem Business Travel, the largest privately owned travel company in Israel. Marom says that the Israeli tourism industry puts a lot of effort into making Chinese guests feel at home, including ""a Chinese breakfast corner"" in many hotels. Some hotels offer Chinese TV channels and Chinese tea. And tourist sites have started to offer brochures in Chinese and Chinese-speaking guides. Staffers at some major retail stores are learning to speak Chinese to showcase the features of the products to the Chinese tourists, says Ayal Segal, a regional manager at Kayak.com, a global online travel company. According to Israeli tourism authorities, Chinese tourists prefer their first visit to be the ""must-see"" places, such as Jerusalem, the Dead Sea and Tel Aviv. They also like to visit historical sites they have read about in books. The Chinese find many similarities between themselves and the Israelis, especially in the open nature of communication and culture, the authorities say. In addition, Chinese tourists are fascinated by Israeli innovation, technology and education, as well as a curiosity about spirituality and Jewish wisdom. A significant portion of the worldwide diamond industry is housed in Israel, and it creates an opportunity for Chinese customers to purchase discounted jewelry, Segal adds. Israel attracted more than 4 million tourists in 2018, which injected about $6 billion into the Israeli economy"

Last year, 24 percent of college graduates chose to leave first-tier cities after working there for three years, up 6 percentage points from 2014. The report also found that leading second-tier cities are luring more recent graduates. Around 37.3 percent of college graduates who chose to work in one of the top 10 second-tier cities such as Hangzhou, Chengdu, Ningbo and Wuhan were from other regions in 2018, up 9.4 percentage points from 2014, the report said. The report, the 11th of its kind, was based on a survey of 303,000 graduates from 30 provincial-level regions. It was released by MyCOS, an education consulting and research institute in Beijing, and Social Sciences Academic Press (China), part of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. Wang Boqing, founder of MyCOS, said large populations, traffic congestion, smog, surging property prices and difficulty in obtaining permanent residence, or hukou, have made life in first-tier cities less attractive for college graduates, which gives second-tier cities an opportunity to attract talented workers. Second-tier cities have also rolled out favorable policies to attract university graduates, which include preferential treatment to obtain hukou, as well as housing and government subsidies, he said. Those cities should maintain their advantages, such as a low cost of living and nicer environment, to retain their appeal, he added. Bai Fan, who graduated in 2015, moved to Ningbo after working in Shenzhen for about one year because he felt too much pressure working in a first-tier city. ""I had to work till 10 pm almost everyday in Shenzhen but after I moved to Ningbo, I can leave work around 5 pm. I feel much more relaxed in Ningbo as it is much cheaper to live there and the city has a much slower pace of life,"" he said. Wang Xin left Beijing in 2017 after working there for two years and found a new job in Hangzhou. ""I don't dislike Beijing, in fact I enjoyed working there quite a lot. However, the high housing prices and difficulty to obtain hukou in the city meant it was very hard for me to live there permanently,"" he said. Wang added that if he works hard enough, buying an apartment in Hangzhou is within reach. China's universities are expected to produce a record 8.34 million graduates this year, up 140,000 from a year earlier, according to the Ministry of Education. Employment is being emphasized by the government this year. Its employment-first policy was included as one of the State's three macro policies for the first time in March, together with fiscal and monetary policies. In this year's Government Work Report, Premier Li Keqiang said that employment is the cornerstone of well-being and the wellspring of wealth. First and foremost, maintaining stable growth ensures employment, Li said."

The gateway allows passengers flying Beijing-Frankfurt routes with Air China, China’s flagship carrier, to enjoy services in Beijing Capital International Airport and Frankfurt Airport, such as a separate check-in counter, special waiting area and luggage pick-up line.  Air China runs two Beijing-Frankfurt flights everyday.  In September, Air China, Beijing Capital International Airport and Frankfurt Airport signed a Memorandum of Understanding for cooperation to build an efficient gateway centered in Beijing and Frankfurt, linking domestic and European lines.  The gateway looks to simplify boarding procedures and reduce transfer time.  Beijing Capital International Airport, as the busiest airport in China with 9.44 million passengers flying in and out of the airport in 2016, links 147 destinations across the world.  Frankfurt Airport is one of the busiest airports in Europe and the world, with 6.08 million passengers traveling via the airport in 2016. The airport can link 247 destinations in 100 countries across the world."
0,"BEIJING - It took Smash customer Qiu Siyu just a few sharp blows with a baseball bat to wreck what looked like an old car radio, after which two friends battered telephones, audio speakers, rice cookers and even a mannequin. All three paid 158 yuan ($23) to spend half an hour in an ""anger room"" in Beijing, where patrons wearing protective gear use hammers and bats to vent their frustration on household objects while staff play music of their choice in the background. Qiu, a bespectacled 16-year-old high school student with braces, said she was there to vent anger about school. ""It feels so good when I destroy those bottles and watch them explode,"" she said, smiling sweetly. Since the venture opened in September, customers have smashed around 15,000 bottles every month, said 25-year-old Jin Meng, who co-founded Smash with her friends. Not intended to promote violence, Smash aims to help people deal with the pressures of living in big cities like Beijing, Jin said, adding that their target customers are between 20 and 35 years old. Another customer, Liu Chao, 32, looked relaxed and pleased after his session. ""If you have money, you can smash anything - smash some TVs, computers, wine bottles, furniture, mannequins, but the only thing you can't do is to smash someone,"" said Liu. Similar ventures already exist in other countries, including the United States. Jin said around 600 people visit Smash each month. ""A woman brought all her wedding photos here, and she smashed them all. We welcome people to bring their own stuff,"" Jin said. ""Every time when we come across cases like this, they affirm our belief that we've provided a safe place to let out negative energy. And we are happy for that."" In Beijing, Jin said her next step is to open a new anger room in a shopping mall where people can take a break from their shopping to smash a bottle or two."
1,"BEIJING - The first-ever China International Import Expo (CIIE), scheduled for Nov 5-10 in Shanghai, will see the participation of over 130 countries and regions, and more than 2,800 companies. Here are some facts and figures about the event. China has been the world's second largest importer of goods for nine consecutive years, and made up 10.2 percent of global imports in 2017. It is one of the world's largest markets of high-end products such as industrial robots, chips and machine tools. The country announced import tariff cuts on 1,585 industrial products including machinery, spare parts and raw materials from Nov 1, after removing tariffs from most imported medicine in May and reducing tariffs on autos and consumer products in July. The CIIE will see 160,000 buyers from over 80,000 domestic and foreign companies, exceeding the organizer's expectation of 15,000 companies. China has granted the status of ""Guest of Honor"" to 12 countries, namely, Brazil, Canada, Egypt, Germany, Hungary, Indonesia, Mexico, Pakistan, Russia, South Africa, Vietnam and the United Kingdom. More than 30 of the world's 44 least developed countries will participate in the event. The expo provides two standard booths free of charge for less developed countries. The CIIE will receive companies from all the G20 member states, as well as 50 countries and regions along the Belt and Road. Attending companies include more than 200 businesses on the Fortune Global 500 list, as well as a wide range of small and medium-sized companies such as fruit exporters in Southeast Asia and coffee makers in South America. The CIIE will receive US chip giants Qualcomm and Intel, Japanese electronics heavyweight Sony and Panasonic, as well as consumer goods leaders Unilever and Lego. German manufacturer Waldrich Coburg will exhibit a 200-ton milling machine, the largest item on display at the expo. Eight world-leading machine tool producers will participate, with more than 10 exhibits making a first appearance in China, Asia or even globally. Exhibitors are expected to launch more than 100 new products and technologies at the event. High-end and intelligent equipment will occupy one of the CIIE's biggest exhibition zones, covering 60,000 square meters. Around 300,000 visitors are expected to arrive in Shanghai during the expo. The municipality said it is geared up to accommodate visitors, and controlled room rates from Oct 26 to Nov 14. More than 5,000 volunteers are recruited for the CIIE, offering language services in English, Japanese, Russian, Arabic, Spanish, Portuguese and French. All volunteers are trained in language delivery, interpersonal communication, coping with stress and service protocol. With a population of around 24 million, the host city of Shanghai is China's industrial and commercial hub, and one of the country's earliest cities to build economic ties with foreign countries. Shanghai port has handled the most containers worldwide for seven consecutive years. In preparation for the expo, Shanghai has set up a specialized court and judicial team for handling civil and commercial cases concerning the expo, the conference and exhibition industry, the expo venue and commercial cases concerning foreign affairs. A special center to deal with disputes concerning intellectual property rights has also been set up. The municipal government has been renovating roads around the expo venue, and has developed cellphone applications to better guide traffic around the area. It added eight bus routes and prepared 100 spare buses for the event."
1,"As awareness of the importance of sex education grows, schools are inviting professionals to give lectures to the students. In September, Xincheng Primary School in Shanghai opened its first sex education course for 9-year-old students in grade four, with the support of Shan Jie Tong Zhen — which started as a private sex education research group, but is now a registered company — offering sex education lectures to parents and students at all levels, from kindergarten to college. Parents are actively encouraged to attend, and feedback is welcomed, according to Gong Yan, the school president. The course has also been available to grade two students since March, the start of the summer semester. Headed by Hu Ping, a well-known expert in sex education, Shan Jie Tong Zhen employs more than 50 lecturers who have provided course in 77 cities nationwide.  Having spent the last year as a lecturer in the organization's Beijing, Yin Yixiu said more parents are becoming more aware of the need to provide children with sex education, and they are willing to pay for the extra courses. In the past year, Yin has delivered 28 lectures in Beijing and neighboring cities, about 70 percent of the classes were at the invitation parents groups. Many schools are now offering courses, mainly funded by parents at a cost of about 1,000 yuan ($115) for a 45-minute lecture, but the lack of qualified lecturers has resulted in a number of public schools inviting Yin to address their students. Last year, Yin approached the education authorities in Beijing and offered to teach the course at a wider range of schools as a regular additional lecture, but her offer was declined.  ""The benefits of sex education are not like test scores or other skills that can be visualized or quantified. On the contrary, the education department is wary of being blamed if the course prompts criticism from parents,"" she said.  Yin received her training in Taiwan, where the courses do not just focus on providing knowledge, but also pay attention to the expression of emotions and greater communication about children's feelings and their attitudes toward sex. She believes the Taiwan model offers a template from which other authorities can learn."

0,"BEIJING - Beijing has used drones to conduct health monitoring of pine trees in the city's northwest Yanqing district, according to Beijing Evening News on Tuesday. The 90 cm long drone can fly about one and a half hours before needing to recharge and can cover more than nine square kilometers. In addition, the sensor on the drone has 42 million pixels, said the newspaper. The drones can automatically capture one partial image every 100 meters. Then hundreds of aerial images generate a remote sensing image which can clearly recognize the suspected areas with pests. Pinewood nematode disease is considered cancer for trees, said the newspaper. The trees could die within 40 days of being infected by the disease. Having a 1,060 square kilometers pine trees forest, the city previously monitored pests by field patrol conducted by ecological managers and forest rangers in most mountain forests. Therefore, it was hard to have timely and comprehensive monitoring."
0,"Francis Tchiegue's busy Beijing life is becoming even busier due to what he calls his ""mission"". In addition to filming TV shows such as Francis Tells Tales and Francis' Tricks for Chinese at the headquarters of StarTimes in the city, Tchiegue also revises multilingual scripts and drafts. The Cameroon national has lived in China for more than a decade. In 2003, he won a scholarship to study for a PhD in Beijing as part of an exchange program sponsored by China and his home country. As a huge fan of Chinese culture, Tchiegue speaks Mandarin fluently and he has become a TV celebrity adored by Chinese audiences. Six months ago, he started to work full time as a host and consultant at StarTimes, one of the largest TV service providers in Africa. ""I came to China to see what I could do for media and cultural exchanges between China and Africa, and StarTimes has been dedicated to this kind of work for years and years. That is why I chose to work here,"" Tchiegue said. ""It is my mission."" In 2002, StarTimes set a goal that distinguished it from other television operators in Africa at the time: To provide affordable and excellent digital TV services for every African family. That goal has now taken root in the continent and won wide recognition from the public and various governments. StarTimes has also registered and set up subsidiaries to provide digital TV services for nearly 20 million users in more than 30 African countries, including Rwanda, Nigeria, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and South Africa. As its name suggests, Star-Times is a rising star on the continent, presenting images of the world to households across Africa. The sight of a family gathered in front of the television enjoying time together is now increasingly common in African countries.,In 2002, when Pang Xinxing, founder of StarTimes, and his team traveled to Africa to assess the market, they were surprised to discover that there were more opportunities on the continent than in the European and American markets. After much consideration, they decided to compete in the digital TV market. ""At that time, digital TV services were a luxury enjoyed by only a small number of people,"" said Pang, noting that the initial installation fee in many African countries was as high as $200 and the monthly subscription ranged from $50 to more than $100. The root cause was monopoly, as large corporations divided and dominated the African market, crushing anyone who challenged them. However, the arrival of StarTimes changed the game. Acting on the philosophy of serving the people through business, StarTimes' subscription was reasonable for most ordinary families. Initial installation cost $10, while the minimum TV package which offered more than 10 channels cost $1 a month. Customer-centered service was also crucial for StarTimes' prosperity in Africa. The unstable voltage and frequency of electricity in many African countries meant TV sets and decoders broke down easily, but few operators offered aftersales services to ordinary people. ""When we first started the business in Africa, we were quite dismayed by the high rate of aftersales maintenance. However, to our great surprise the local people were very grateful because every time they returned a broken TV we gave them a makeshift one and fixed the problem as quickly as possible,"" Pang said. StarTimes' aftersales service was revolutionary. The wholehearted effort in solving technical problems for local people quickly saw the brand become popular and trusted in many countries.,This game-changing service and business model was underpinned by StarTimes' technology. Since 2008, the company has seized the chance to boost investment in TV technology and built four basic networks, comprising signal relay, direct broadcast satellite, digital terrestrial TV transmission and online video. StarTimes' TV signal now covers the entire African continent. More than 480 programs in 11 languages, from local stations to China's mainstream media, world-famous channels and StarTimes originals, are broadcast via the platform, with topics ranging from news to sports, along with movies and fashion. StarTimes is now striving to promote its digital TV services in rural areas of Africa as part of its effort to carry out the Access to Satellite TV for 10,000 African Villages project initiated by China in 2015. It is a challenging task, but for many African people it is an amazing gift and a gateway to the outside world. Joseph Runyenje Lopeyok, an ardent soccer fan, lives in Likii village, Laikipia county, in central Kenya. He was able to watch this year's World Cup tournament thanks to the clear signals guaranteed by the StarTimes decoder installed in his backyard. ""Even my wife and daughters, who are not normally soccer fans, were enticed by the games,"" Lopeyok said. The first time he traveled to Africa, Pang felt a kind of ""natural connection between me and the African people"". ""Once I asked an African leader what the most complex human relationship in the world was, and without a second thought he said: 'That between a mother-in-law and a daughter-in-law',"" Pang said. That answer is echoed in traditional Chinese culture and countless TV shows. StarTimes' Sino Drama channel is a big hit in Africa. It broadcasts popular Chinese TV dramas, such as Doudou and Her Mother-in-Law and The Journey of the Flower, dubbed into different languages. In 2011, the company established a translation and dubbing center. With output capacity of 10,000 hours, the center dubs programs into eight languages: Chinese, English, French, Portuguese, Swahili, Hausa, Yoruba and Luganda. To attract more talent, StarTimes also holds TV drama dubbing competitions, and the winners are offered jobs at the company's Beijing headquarters. ""One principle we always stick to is that we will never lower our standards in the African market. Providing a less qualified service would not only be disrespectful to the audience, but also disrespectful to the arts,"" Pang said. On its 43 original channels, home-produced dramas, kung fu shows and dubbing competitions are all popular with African audiences. ""Compared with many other foreigners, African students are more gifted in learning Chinese, either in terms of pronunciation or comprehension of the language,"" Tchiegue said. That's part of the reason African voice actors and actresses have few cultural barriers in dubbing Chinese TV series, especially family dramas. The connection between Chinese people and Africans constantly inspires StarTimes to move forward. To make more Chinese TV shows accessible to African audiences in rural and suburban areas, StarTimes sent out TV caravans to provide broadcast services. Wherever the caravans went, children chased after them and danced to the music they played, while villagers would sit on chairs they brought with them, happily waiting for the show to begin. China has been adhering to the principles of sincerity, real results, affinity and good faith in its African policy. In Pang's view, the benefits African people can gain from such cooperation are fundamental to the principles. StarTimes is expanding and accelerating its localization year by year. urrently, it employs more than 4,000 people in Africa, with locals accounting for more than 95 percent. Meanwhile, there are more than 7,000 StarTimes agents across Africa, and they have generated around 50,000 jobs. ""Any company that really wants to take root in Africa should make an effort to boost social and human development in Africa. Creating more jobs is part of its social responsibility,"" Pang said.,China-Africa relations have reached a stage of growth unmatched in history. While an increasing number of Chinese are visiting Africa, many more Africans are choosing China as a destination to work and live. Gabon national Bolabola Joelle Zita has worked as a fashion host and voice actress at StarTimes's headquarters for 17 months. Zita earned a bachelor's at Beijing Language and Culture University and a master's at the University of Science and Technology Beijing. Back in her home country, Zita was a government employee who dreamed of working in the fashion industry. However, until she joined StarTimes she never imagined that her dream would ever be realized. ""I appreciate the opportunity and environment that StarTimes has offered to help me grow as a TV host. It is a company that is willing to teach and listen to you,"" she said. Now Zita's makeup show S-Belle is broadcast to African audiences via StarTimes channels, and it can even be seen in small, remote villages. ""Although I have to get up at 5 o'clock every morning and work all day, I never get bored or tired, because I am doing something I love. TV shows give me a better understanding of the different cultures in Africa and the world,"" Zita said. ""It is amazing, isn't it - I'm getting to know more about Africa while in China."" Brice Icigumije, from Burundi, has lived in Beijing for a year. He works on a TV show called 100 Cine which focuses on movies. ""I try to give African audiences a glimpse of the latest movies from across the world and encourage them to go to the cinema,"" Icigumije said, with a smile. ""This is a job I feel passionate about."" During the 2018 Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, which concluded on Tuesday, Tchiegue spent time helping African embassies in China with receptions and arrangements for meetings. ""Many of my friends didn't understand why I went to China rather than European or American countries, but now they are all happy for me because I have finally found something I enjoy doing which is not about money,"" he said. ""Through the TV shows we make together, I hope the Chinese can get closer to the real Africa and Africans to the real China."" Tchiegue is also an enthusiastic cultural ambassador. He makes tours and delivers speeches across the world to help people learn Chinese and get closer to Chinese culture. When we met him, he was looking forward to taking part in the people-to-people and cultural exchange events at the summit. ""I will definitely participate in the events,"" he said. ""It is a kind of priceless happiness."""

0,"Peng Lei bursts into laughter when he is asked about the birth of his band, New Pants. ""I really didn't expect that we would go this far,"" says Peng down the phone from his home in Beijing. As the frontman of New Pants, Peng founded the Beijing-based band in 1996 along with his schoolmate, Pang Kuang. They were both students at an art college in Beijing majoring in animation back then. ""I thought the band would break up or soon be forgotten,"" adds Peng, the self-taught guitarist, who had previously formed his own band in high school. Decades later, New Pants has grown into one of the most-watched bands in the country and has released eight full-length albums, including their 2007 hit opus, Dragon Tiger Panacea, which mixes vintage 1980s' new wave with disco. They play a retro blend of synthpop, punk and rock, drawing influence from a diverse spectrum of bands from the 1970s, 80s and the early 90s. On March 23, New Pants will be performing in the capital for the first time in eight years with a concert at Beijing Workers' Gymnasium. It is a testament to the ensemble's enduring popularity that when tickets for the concert went on sale on Feb 15, they sold out within 10 minutes. The show will be the finale of the band's nationwide tour, entitled New Wave, which kicked off in April last year and has encompassed more than 10 cities, including Changsha, Hunan province, Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, Chongqing and Tianjin. ""We are not productive as a band. For each show, we want to have fun and be different,"" says Peng.,This ethos is demonstrated perfectly by the poster for the upcoming Beijing concert. It pays homage to the cover of the band's self-titled debut album, and has the four members: guitarist-vocalist Peng, key-board player-vocalist Pang, bassist Zhao Meng and drummer Hayato, lying on their sides, facing the camera in mock-seduction, set against bold, primary colors. While the poster features current photos of the bandmates, on the original album cover, they were replaced by crudely drawn cartoon figures. That first album, released in 1998, was heavily influenced by American punk rock band, the Ramones, and soon won the band a loyal fanbase thanks to their raw punk vibe. As Peng recalls, the indie music scene in the capital back then was dominated by heavy metal music. ""It was a totally different way of looking at the world then,"" Peng says. ""The indie music scene was not appealing to the mainstream audience, but it was vibrant."" After graduating from university, Peng worked for a Beijing-based advertising company, making about 1,500 yuan ($224) a month. A year later, he spent his first year's income on a guitar, which he bought in Hong Kong. In 1997, the band signed to Beijing-based indie record label, Modern Sky, and Peng became a full-time singer-songwriter. The band developed with the label, which was founded by former rocker, Shen Lihui, in that same year. In the beginning, the label only signed three indie bands: New Pants, Supermarket, and Sober, for which Shen was the leading vocalist. ""No one was interested in indie music then. The scene was dominated by mainstream record companies. We just made music for fun. It was purely idealism,"" says Shen.,Decades later, things have changed. Indie music has become incredibly popular among young Chinese music lovers and Modern Sky has grown into the largest indie record label in the country, which is home to over a hundred bands and artists. It's brainchild, Strawberry Music Festival, has become a popular outdoor music event, attracting a young Chinese audience from across the country. The label has also expanded its reach by establishing satellite offices, signing local bands and artists and hosting outdoor music festivals in the United Kingdom and the United States. With fans opening up to a greater diversity of music, New Pants has been experimenting various different styles, such as old school punk, disco, and electronic music. The music, however, is not all that keeps New Pants going. In his early 40s, Peng, who is now a father, says that the key to the bands longevity is the constant energy and drive to be creative. Besides music, Peng, who was born into an intellectual family, has embarked on various career opportunities. He published a book of illustrations, directed movies and has held art exhibitions. One of his books, Beihai Monster, released in 2009, was inspired by his own life and named after Beihai Park, which was one of his favorite places as a child. Like Peng, keyboard player Pang has also developed his career in other fields besides music, launching his own fashion brand and working as a designer."

0,"A system to help Beijing courts share resources of technical investigators during intellectual property cases was nearly ready, the municipal high people's court said on Friday. To effectively improve handling of some difficult IP disputes, courts citywide have been encouraged to invite experts attend case hearings to help judges understand and study technical details, according to a statement of the Beijing High People's Court.

0,"Qi Baishi's works are on display at the Palace Museum, in a rare show of a modern Chinese artist at the venue, Wang Kaihao reports. While Qi Baishi (1864-1957) is a household name in China, an exhibition of his paintings was last held at the Palace Museum in Beijing, or the Forbidden City, 64 years ago. The museum, which was the seat of the royal court in imperial China from 1420 to 1911, is hosting a show on the modern artist, with some 200 of his paintings and seals exhibited at the Meridian Gate Gallery since last week. The exhibits are both from the museum's own collection and that of the Beijing Fine Art Academy. For the general public, Qi's best-known works are his paintings of shrimps, due to the many legends on how he created them. As a result, many of his paintings of shrimps, crabs and fish are on display at the ongoing exhibition. In 1960,  China's first ink-and-water animation film that was inspired by Qi's other paintings, won praise abroad. ""In his early years, Qi drew shrimps to mostly learn from ancient painters,"" Xue Liang, a researcher with the Beijing Fine Art Academy, says. ""But he later developed a personal style by using shades of dark ink to reflect the texture of a shrimp's body, giving its antennas an almost real-life feel."" Nevertheless, Qi's works went beyond aquatic life. ""Qi Baishi is the representative artist of Chinese art in the 20th century,"" says Wu Hongliang, deputy director of the Beijing Fine Art Academy.,Be it landscapes, birds, flowers or figures, Qi's paintings are high on expression and detail, Wu says. He is also known for his seal carvings, poems and for setting art school trends. Qi was prolific even in his 70s. In a group of paintings that are now on show, Qi drew some insects in the corners, leaving parts of the images blank. According to Lyu Xiao, another researcher at the Beijing Fine Art Academy, Qi did so because he wanted to fill in the parts later while focusing on the finer details first, before his eyesight became weaker. ""He had planned to fill these spaces with flowers later on, when he thought he wouldn't see as clearly as he did while painting the insects,"" Lyu explains. After New China was founded in 1949, Qi was widely hailed as a ""people's artist"". Wang Yamin, curator of the ongoing exhibition, says: ""He was not only diligent, but also had a taste that was close to the grassroots."" A native of Xiangtan, Hunan province, Qi used to be a carpenter. He first learned painting from folk artists and later sold paintings for a living in Shanghai and Beijing during the period of great social upheaval in the country. That was also a time when he met some influential painters. Such life experiences made him understand different social strata, rather than catering to only high tastes. Among his other paintings exhibited are flowers with blessings for prosperity, vegetables indicating harvests and farming tools to express his nostalgia for his hometown. ""People love these paintings because they remind us of the mountains and waters in the countryside, and remind us where we come from,"" Wang says.,The words on more than 100 displayed seals at the museum also reflect Qi's introspection of his own life: He started as a carpenter and became a famous artist but kept looking for larger goals, especially as he got older. When many other Chinese artists retreated from social life at an old age, Qi wanted to take on more social responsibilities. In his painting,   (prosperity in tranquility), which is a source of the exhibition title, an old man is seen holding a vase, with a fruit bat hovering over him. The vase symbolizes ""peace"" in Chinese culture and the bat ""happiness"", following the Mandarin pronunciations of the words. ""That painting reveals he expected a stable and harmonious life,"" Wu says. ""That's a common Chinese person's wish, too."" After World War II had ended, Qi also called for global peace. ""Actually, his art echoes a modernist trend in the world at the time. Yet he expressed it in a typically Chinese way,"" Wu explains. The pigeon is another common theme in Qi's art during his later years, showing his wish for world peace, just as Pablo Picasso did. In 1956, the World Peace Council bestowed the International Peace Prize on then-nonagenarian Qi.,In his message to the awards ceremony, Qi said: ""I love my hometown, the beautiful and prosperous lands of my country and all lives there. I've spent my lifetime integrating the ordinary Chinese people's emotions into my paintings and poems. In recent years, I have realized that what I pursue is world peace."" In the past, many people focused on Qi's paintings because of their high values at auction, Shan Jixiang, director of the Palace Museum, says. ""We want to show his spirit and cultural significance through this exhibition, especially at a time when mutual learning and coexistence of different civilizations are advocated."" Though the Palace Museum is dedicated to housing ancient art, it also has about 6,000 pieces of modern art, including 400 of Qi's works, most of which have rarely been exhibited before. Earlier this year, the museum held an exhibition for Wu Changshuo's (1844-1927) work, with one calligraphy piece promoting Qi's paintings as a highlight. Still, the museum needs more space to hold exhibitions for eminent individual modern Chinese artists. Shan, the director, reveals that a new branch gallery of the museum will soon be established near the Forbidden City, which will be used entirely to display modern art."
0,"Courts nationwide prosecuted 77 kindergarten employees on charges of child abuse between January and November, with another 69 arrested and awaiting trial, the top prosecuting authority said on Thursday. While the numbers are not large, an expert has said they show that authorities are paying greater attention to child protection, including against sexual predators. Shi Weizhong, deputy director of juvenile prosecution for the Supreme People's Procuratorate, said local authorities are testing several methods to stop convicted sex offenders from working with minors, such as at preschools. ""Some local procuratorates have made commendable attempts and achieved good results,"" he said at a news conference on Thursday. He cited two examples: Shanghai, which has a database of sex offenders that allows employers to run background checks on potential hires; and Shandong province, which has a platform for police officers to alert specialist prosecutors of potential child abuse cases early, to make investigations faster and more efficient. The SPP sees local procuratorates as ""laboratories for prosecuting crimes against juveniles"", Shi said, adding that other regions will be encouraged to replicate successful practices. A series of high-profile scandals have thrown a spotlight onto child protection, drawing more attention from the public and authorities. The SPP issued a circular on abuse at kindergartens on Dec 1, which resulted in prosecutors stepping up assistance for police in investigations as well as educating the managers of preschools on how to keep their students safe. ""People used to regard physical punishment as a way for teachers to discipline their students, but the number of arrests and prosecutions this year show both the public and prosecutors are realizing it is a problem,"" said Song Yinghui, a law professor at Beijing Normal University. On Nov 13, Shanghai police detained a suspect surnamed Zheng who ran a day care center where staff members were filmed hitting toddlers. Three employees were also detained. Around the same time, Beijing police detained teachers over alleged child abuse at a kindergarten operated by Golden Cradle Education. The company has more than 700 kindergartens and schools nationwide. The Beijing Education Commission conducted a citywide safety inspection of kindergartens last month, with the results listed in a database. Those with potential risks or problems were told to make immediate improvements. Zheng Xinjian, director of juvenile prosecution for the SPP, said in addition to the work by local procuratorates, legislators should also look to strengthen the laws on child protection. ""Though existing laws have clauses to protect children, they are scattered in different laws and it's not systematic. That causes problems,"" he said."
0,"China launched its largest operation to control air pollution in northern regions on Wednesday, using more than 5,600 inspectors to push the areas to meet ambitious pollution reduction targets this year. Unlike the nationwide inspections conducted last year, headed by the State Council, the yearlong, intensified inspection is being led by the Ministry of Environmental Protection. The 5,600-plus inspectors will keep a spotlight on governments and companies in 28 major cities in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and the neighboring provinces of Henan, Shanxi and Shandong, which are susceptible to heavy smog, the ministry said. Inspectors will check important areas like governments' implementation of air pollution control efforts, companies' emissions monitoring equipment and monitoring networks. They will also shut down small plants with high emissions, it added. ""Through the inspection, the ministry will push these governments and involved companies to fully implement measures to tackle the air pollution,"" Zhai Qing, vice-minister of environmental protection, said on Wednesday. ""We will keep eyes on the regions with pollution problems and stick with them until all the pollution issues that are exposed are solved,"" he said, adding the results should be released to the public. During a separate, weeklong inspection that the ministry started on April 1 in the same northern regions, seven inspection teams have checked over 450 companies and government departments, finding at least 281 violations, including companies that falsified monitoring data or discharged excessive pollutants, ministry officials said. Zhai said the inspection has worked to lower pollution. ""The minister and vice-ministers frequently have been seen leading inspections in northern regions, showing their focus on the issue,"" said Chang Jiwen, an expert in environmental policies with the State Council Development Research Center. Though the inspection worked, he suggested it's more efficient and effective to motivate the cities and counties to better control pollution than high-level but short-lived inspections. For the northern regions, where similar pollution problems were frequently found, the ministry should suspend approvals of environmental impact assessments for new projects－necessary before construction can begin－forcing corrective action by cities and counties before assessments in their jurisdiction can go forward, Chang said. By the end of 2017, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region should lower the concentration of PM2.5－fine particulate matter that is harmful to health－by 25 percent from the 2012 level, according to the Action Plan on Air Pollution Prevention and Control, released by the central government in 2013. The PM2.5 concentration in Beijing should be cut to 60 micrograms per cubic meter this year, down from 73 last year, which officials and experts agree is a major challenge. To meet the goals, the governments both in Beijing municipality and at the central government level have taken what experts call extra tough restrictions on pollutant emissions in the northern region, such as the annual regional pollution control plan released two weeks ago. It requires cement and casting plants in the 28 cities to suspend production during the heating season from Nov 15 to March 15, though those providing heating services and processing dangerous waste are not included."
1,"Beijing will open its financial sector wider to the world in three years, as the city undertakes a major push to deepen reform and opening-up in the service industry, a vice-mayor said on Wednesday. Yin Yong, vice-mayor of Beijing, said the financial sector is on the top of the list of the capital city's opening-up undertakings. One of the major tasks is to strengthen the city's role as a financial management center, which can facilitate China's financial reform and opening-up, as well as risk prevention, he said. He made the remarks at a news conference, introducing in detail a three-year action plan for Beijing to continue opening up its service sector. The plan gained approval from the State Council in January. Among the 177 measures listed in the plan, those concerning the financial sector account for more than 25 percent, Yin said. This year, Beijing plans to ""launch a series of heavyweight financial institutions, foster and develop financial technology and green finance, promote the sector's opening-up and innovation, and improve the supervision system,"" Yin said. For the insurance, asset management and securities industries, Beijing will raise the foreign ownership cap to 51 percent this year, Yin said. ""The city will remove the limit completely in two years."" The plan said Beijing should step up efforts to streamline administration, delegate power to lower levels and improve regulation and services, seek to open the service sector wider, and create a sound business environment. Yin said Beijing will further optimize the business environment in the capital city for foreign investors, foreign companies and foreign talents. For instance, the city will explore the mode for negative list management in all fields, he said. A negative list defines areas in which foreign enterprises are not allowed to invest. Beijing started to commit itself to service sector opening-up in 2015, when the State Council approved the pilot programs. Li Chenggang, assistant minister of commerce, said the pilot programs have improved the development of modern services in Beijing and played a leading role in the country. Li said the Ministry of Commerce will join the city to speed up the implementation of the measures and make breakthroughs in service sector development, in order to offer more useful experiences for advancing a new round of high-level opening-up nationwide and building an open economy. For years, China has been dedicated to shifting its economic growth model toward one driven by consumption, services and innovation. Data showed the service sector has been contributing more to the country's economic growth. The sector's value-added output accounted for 52.2 percent of GDP in 2018, 0.3 percentage point higher than the previous year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics."

0,"One year after Tong Jiajia was admitted to study at Peking University in 1998, the international relations major applied to participate in the Beijing College Student Dance Festival. For Tong, who is an amateur dancer and learned traditional Chinese folk dance as a child, it was a great stage to fulfill her dream of being a dancer. During her studies at Peking University, Tong participated in the annual dance festival every year, performing a variety of dances, including contemporary dance works, traditional Chinese folk dances and folk dances of other cultures. ""You don't have to be a dance professional to enjoy and perform dance works onstage. I truly enjoyed myself when I was dancing,"" says Tong. She adds that it's also a way to explore what it's like to be a dance professional and explore different styles of dance. The dance festival runs through June 2. The event has over 100 Beijing-based universities and colleges, including Peking University, Tsinghua University, Beijing Normal University and Renmin University of China, presenting 26 dance performances to the public, ranging from ballet and folk dance to contemporary performances.,  Now, as a teacher at the School of Arts of Peking University, Tong not only offers students dance training and dance theory, but also takes them to participate in the festival. This year, she will lead around two dozen students who study different majors at Peking University. They will perform a dance work titled Dainty Beauty. Tong says that the work is inspired by a trip in 2015 to Midu county in the Dali Bai autonomous prefecture located in western Yunnan province. Tong spent about a week there with five students, visiting villages and learning the local dance and music. The typical dance of that region sees performers dancing with fans and flower-decorated lanterns. In Dainty Beauty, students will preserve the authenticity of the dance while creating a contemporary take on those dance moves. ""Art education is vital for the development of a student. The primary focus of the Beijing College Student Dance Festival is to support and promote the talent and the students' creativity in college and university. It is an exciting and inspiring experience for our students,"" says professor Pan Zhishou of Beijing Dance Academy, one of the main organizers of the dance festival."
0,"A case in which six people were jailed for helping dozens of students cheat on China's national exam for graduate schools shows that such operations are becoming more organized and sophisticated, according to a Beijing judge. On Tuesday, Zhang Wuya and five accomplices were sentenced to prison terms ranging from 20 months to four years for using high-tech equipment to provide answers to 33 students during the exam in December 2016. The group provided the test-takers with wireless transmitters and receivers, and instructed them to read the questions aloud. Their voices were picked up by off-site researchers, who used textbooks and other resources to send them the correct answer. Haidian District People's Court, which heard the case, did not disclose how much students were charged for the service. However, the six defendants received fines ranging from 10,000 to 40,000 yuan ($1,460 to $5,840). Cao Xiaoying, a judge at the court, said the case is believed to be the largest involving organized cheating in Beijing since the Criminal Law was amended in 2015 to outlaw facilitating cheaters or hiring others to take a State-level exam. The crime is punishable by up to seven years in prison. She said the illegal use of wireless equipment to cheat seriously jeopardizes the integrity of the examination and called for heavier punishments and tougher regulations to stamp out the problem. The court said Zhang established an education company in Beijing and came up with the idea of using wireless equipment to help students cheat, while fellow defendants Lyu Shilong, Zhang Xiayang and Zhang Zongqun were responsible for recruiting test-takers. Zhang Wuya purchased signal transmitters, signal receivers and other equipment, while the others handed out the receivers and transmitters to the students, as well as organized mock tests to check the equipment. Two other accomplices, Li Qian and Zhang Feng, were tasked with recruiting people as off-site researchers and providing answers to test questions. Lyu and Zhang Xiayang also took part in the exams and were among the students who received the answers. It is not yet known what punishments the other test-takers who cheated will face. According to figures from the court, the capital has recorded 34 cases of cheating in various national exams since 2016, including those for prospective graduate students and teachers. Wang Jingbo, a professor at China University of Political Science and Law, said cheating has formed a profit chain consisting of various criminal activities and involves a wider scope of students. The ways that students cheat are also constantly changing, and efforts to prevent cheating should be enhanced. ""This is necessary since cheating on exams shows not only a lack of personal integrity, but it's also a serious violation of the law and regulations. For exams that affect students' future development, fairness must be guaranteed,"" Wang said. The Central Commission for Guiding Ethics and Cultural Progress launched a campaign on Monday to eliminate unethical or dishonest behavior in economic and social areas, including cheating on exams."

The export and import volumes of Beijing's culture trade topped 6.02 billion U.S. dollars in 2018. Up to now, the capital's cultural and service products have been exported to over 140 countries and regions. Beijing also maintained upbeat momentum in sectors of animation, comic and games (ACG), press and publication, film and television, as well as service trade, said Dong Dianyi, vice director of Beijing's State-owned Cultural Assets Supervision and Administration Office. In recent years, Beijing has promoted industry convergence between its cultural sector and fields of technology and finance, said Zhao Lei with the city's publicity department. Beijing will push forward a series of measures to facilitate financing in the cultural sector and improve the related business environment, said Dong. As Beijing shifts away from old-growth drivers, the service industry is now a key growth engine that firmly steers the economy forward."

The break combines both the National Day holiday and the Mid-Autumn Festival, traditionally a time for family reunions. According to China's travel platform Mafengwo, travel topics regarding the National Day holiday on the platform are buzzing. The topics' search volume surged by 210 percent in August, compared with July.  The top 10 domestic tourism destinations are Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, Chongqing, Xi'an, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, Sanya, Xiamen and Qingdao, according to Mafengwo's latest travelling trends report. Compared with past years' hot domestic tourism destinations, this year's places are almost unchanged. That shows Chinese tourists have formed their travelling preferences, said Feng Rao, head of Mafengwo's research center.  Chinese people are changing their travel goals from visiting scenic spots in a hurry to enjoying a leisurely lifestyle in new places, Feng said.  Delicious food becomes an important factor in domestic tourism destination picks. About 67 percent of tourists will consider this when selecting places to travel.  Mafengwo said during the upcoming National Day holiday tourists will mainly come from first- and second -tier cities. The average domestic tourism package price is 3,410 yuan ($521) for this year's National Day holiday, an increase of 21 percent from the same time a year earlier. Among the top 10 domestic tourism destinations, Sanya's tourism package price is highest at 4,665 yuan, increased 26.5 percent from the previous year.  This year, outbound travel remains sizzling. The average outbound tourism package price is 7,906 yuan for this year's National Day holiday, an increase of 45 percent from the same time a year earlier.

Ge's decided to become a dubber five years ago after turning down a job offer in her hometown in northeast China, and launched her career in Beijing. Before long she found joy in her work as Ge enjoyed recitation since she was a child. Ge usually reads scripts many times before recording, which helps her to get into the character and bring out the emotions. After recording, Ge checks her audio with recordist.

""We have treated more than 27 kilometers of the waterways to protect the environment and reduced more than 7,727 hectares of livestock farms,"" said Wang Honghong, vice-mayor of the city and a member of the 13th CPPCC National Committee.  Besides, the city has launched many biological restoration programs along the canal, she said.  ""We also made strict regulations to protect the ecosystem along the canal. The three industrial parks near the canal are required to improve technologies to better protect the neighboring environment,"" Wang said.  According to her, the city canceled a travel program that would have attracted an investment of more than 10 billion yuan ($1.5 billion) to protect an archaeological site during exploration. The canal runs through 93 kilometers in Huai'an, which accounts for one seventh of the man-made waterway listed as a UNESCO World Intangible Cultural Heritage site in 2014. Stretching 1,797 km between Beijing and Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, the canal's history dates back to the Spring and Autumn Period (770-476 BC) and was completed in the Sui Dynasty (581-618). ""It requires hard work and research to protect the time-honored canal,"" Wang said. ""We'll continue to restore the ecology and culture about the canal and share our experience with other cities for more effective protection."""
0,"Over the past few days, Fang Zhong, head of the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Physics, has become something of an online celebrity.  ""I hope you choose physics, and fall in love with it,"" Fang told freshmen at a Beijing high school in August.  The remark was a response to a worrying decline in the love for physics among senior high school students. Among the 290,000 students from Zhejiang province who took this year's gaokao - the annual college entrance exam - only 80,000, or 27.5 percent, picked physics as a prime area of interest. In Shanghai, it was 30 percent. The test is geared toward the subjects a student selects.  Criticized for forcing students to choose between science and liberal arts - requiring them to choose one path or the other - Shanghai and Zhejiang province have been running a revised system. Students can choose any three of six subjects listed, along with compulsory Chinese, math and English. But students consider physics to be difficult and don't want to risk their gaokao score, so they tend not to pick it.  ""Students who are good at science but weak in physics tended to replace it with a humanities subject,"" said a physics teacher surnamed Hou in Zhejiang. ""Those subjects are seen as safer.""  The situation has raised concerns, especially among educators.  ""Physics is the basis for many other natural sciences,"" said Li Yuwei, a physics teacher at the high school affiliated with Beijing Normal University. ""Those with a physics background who transfer to other majors are more likely to succeed.""  Xiong Bingqi, vice-president of the 21st Century Education Research Institute, said that students and their parents need to think about quality and personality, not just blindly pursue higher marks.  ""As long as that doesn't change, the new gaokao will be no different from the old gaokao,"" he said.  The Ministry of Education has set new standards on science in primary schools that took effect this semester. The standards stress inspiring children's curiosity and desire for knowledge, while regulating teaching methods.  ""Younger kids are very curious about a lot of things, making it easier to get them interested,"" said Liu Ying, a doctoral supervisor at Peking University.  Still, Xiong Bingqi wants more to be done. He thinks colleges should separate exam results from enrollment.  ""Only then can we make science education an inspiration,"" he said.  Xinhua"
0,"Hamlet will have its most accurate Chinese rendering yet thanks to a new adaptation of the classic that's set to hit the stage, Zhang Kun reports in Shanghai. Often portrayed as a melancholic young man burdened with indecisiveness, Hamlet will take on the form of a hero and philosopher in the upcoming Chinese adaptation of the famous Shakespearean play that will be performed at the Shanghai Grand Theater over Jan 16-17. The play marks the second time that 57-year-old theater director Li Liuyi is working with the Shakespeare Folio Translation Project, an initiative by the Royal Shakespeare Company, a major British theater company in Stratford-upon-Avon. RSC's folio translation project is aimed at making William Shakespeare's works more accessible to Chinese speakers. Li is an award-winning theater director whose previous work includes Tea House by Lao She, the classical Greek tragedy Antigone, The Cherry Orchard by Anton Chekhov and Shakespeare's King Lear in 2016-the first play he worked on as part of the RSC project.,Li says his production will ""be loyal to the original"", though he did move Hamlet's famous opening soliloquy to the end of the play. The adaptation will also feature a recital of the line ""To be, or not to be? That is the question,"" in six interpretations to show the differing views that translators have of the story. ""Each translator has made his or her personal interpretation. They have provided the guide for me to understand the play, and discover the ideas of Shakespeare,"" says Li. ""The Chinese language has evolved over the decades, and ideas have changed. We wanted to make a new production for a contemporary Chinese audience."" The main translator for the play, Li Jianming, has already received praise for her work. According to a Beijing News review-the production premiered at the National Center for Performing Arts in Beijing in December-Li Jianming's work is ""extremely well suited to live performance"". The director picked Chinese actor Hu Jun to play the role of Hamlet. Li Liuyi says Hu is the best contemporary Chinese actor for the role because of his involvement with theater productions before he became famous for portraying heroic characters in martial arts shows. The director also made the bold decision to have Lu Fang, who happens to be Hu's wife, to play the roles of Ophelia and Gertrude. In some scenes, these two characters appear on stage at the same time, requiring Lu to shift between two roles without a change in outfit.,""You will have no difficulty distinguishing the two characters,"" Li Liuyi says. ""Lu Fang is one of the best actresses from the Beijing People's Art Theater, and you can analyze my design of her two roles using the Oedipus complex theories, but her rich-layered performance will tell more than just that."" Veteran actor Pu Cunxin, who is the chairman of the China Theater Association, will play the role of Claudius and the ghost of the late king. RSC's Shakespeare Folio Translation Project aims to have all 36 of the playwright's works translated to create a new collection of Chinese translations by 2023. The translations are tested through a series of workshops and rehearsals. ""Together, theater workers and translators will unpick the clues about meaning, character and pacing that have been ignored in previous translations,"" says RSC artistic director Gregory Doran.

0,"China's flourishing science fiction genre reflects the dynamism of the country's culture and economy On at least one occasion five years ago the science fiction writers Liu Cixin and Han Song decided to contribute their own money to get people to take notice of their greatly ignored genre. When the annual 2012 Chinese Nebula award presentations were held in Chengdu, science fiction was so little known that each of them donated 10,000 yuan ($1,600) to ensure that the ceremony could go ahead. But three years later another awards ceremony in another place would be enough to give those in China who admire Liu and Han, and who love science fiction, reason to hope that no longer would it be treated as a poor cousin to mainstream literature. At the World Science Fiction Awards in Spokane, Washington state, Liu was announced as winner of the Hugo Award of 2015 for best novel for The Three Body Problem, and that Saturday night in August, as Ken Liu, who translated the book into English, accepted the award on the author's behalf, it became clear that Chinese science-fiction had finally arrived on the world stage.,To underscore the point, at the subsequent World Science Fiction Awards in Kansas City, Missouri, almost exactly a year later Hao Jingfang won the Hugo for best novelette for her story Folding Beijing, which Liu also translated. Those award successes set alight the imaginations of Chinese readers and have transformed science fiction into a star not only of book publishing but of films, video games and amusement parks as well. A big-screen movie based on The Three Body Problem is being made at the moment, and the 800-hectare, 10 billion yuan ($1.52 billion) Oriental Sci-Fi Valley theme park is due to open soon in Guiyang, Guizhou province. In the park there is a heavy emphasis on virtual reality that ties in with Guiyang's large big data industry. Last month the Sichuan Association for Science and Technology announced plans to build a 12 billion yuan China Science Fiction City in Chengdu aimed at showcasing and developing China's cultural industry. It is not as though Chinese science fiction is exactly new, having its roots in the early 1900s, so why has it taken the best part of a century for the genre to begin to show anything like its best potential, and what does it say about the country?,Xia Jia, a science fiction writer and associate professor of Chinese literature at Xi'an Jiaotong University, says: ""You can sense there is general anxiety about the future of humanity, but you could also say Chinese people are anxious about their own future. How will they survive the pressures of cutthroat competition? In Liu Cixin's rivalry between humans and aliens, some see another version of the competition between powerful countries. In this there is a feeling of crisis brought on by globalization."" In an essay titled ""What makes Chinese science fiction Chinese?"" Xia said ""the crises of capitalist culture accompanied by the process of globalization are manifested in the daily lives of Chinese people"". China's society and economy have been transformed over the past 30 years or so, and many different aspects of this are reflected in science fiction stories, Xia tells China Daily. ""In these stories you can see that Chinese people are extremely anxious about the tensions between traditional China and the dream to be part of the modern world. You can see such anxieties in Liu Cixin's works and other short stories."",Han Song, who in addition to writing science fiction is a senior executive at Xinhua News Agency, says that when the genre first came to the country it served as a mirror of Chinese society and the process of modernization. ""China has a very long civilization, and science fiction first played a role in the rejuvenation of that civilization in the first part of the 20th century. For example, a lot of science fiction at the very beginning just imagined how China would become a very, very strong country."" Nathaniel Isaacson, associate professor of modern Chinese literature at North Carolina State University, says that when Chinese science fiction first appeared early last century the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) was collapsing, European countries had again invaded Beijing to put down the Boxer Rebellion, and many coastal areas were under European control. These early Chinese science fiction often explored the place of China in the world and looked at ways it could overcome European colonialism, Isaacson says. ""Fairly often what they imagined was a future where China (was) politically, economically and culturally dominant. For example, the short story New Story of the Stone (which Wu Jianren wrote in the early 1900s) imagined a world where Shanghai had become a world center of trade and commerce, hosted a world expo and global political summits. But the narrative falls apart. At that time people could not imagine such things coming to pass. But they did happen in the early 21st century."", For China, science fiction has gradually become ""a real soft power"", Han says. ""It even had an impact on Barack Obama. Who could ever have imagined that? It's real power is because it touches real problems - philosophical and spiritual things. That is soft power."" In fact the popularity and success of science fiction in a country seems to go hand-in-hand with its rising political and economic strength, Han says, pointing to Britain's golden age as a world power, the rise of the United States to that status, and the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War. In each case, science fiction was very popular at the time, he says. ""Even in Japan in the 1970s there was a lot of very good science fiction. Perhaps China is now at that juncture."" However, Chinese science fiction's focus on the country's culture and the country's future does not imply that it is jingoistic. Wu Yan, professor of humanities at Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, says: ""Liu Cixun's idea is very, very Chinese. In the future, problems are solved. The Earth will be united as one. It is a kind of ancient Chinese thinking about 'under Heaven'. It's like the Chinese view of the world in imperial times that derives from Confucianism. Confucius has four stages of development: cultivate yourself, manage your family, administer your country and become united under heaven."" Han Song argues that science fiction is now leaving its roots as a tool to popularize science and provides deep insights into China's culture and current life. ""Although science fiction in China is more than 100 years old, over the past 20 years it has gradually become a new way to express ideas about what is happening in Chinese society, not only about the universe or technology. It deals with what change in Chinese culture is about."",Science fiction was once seen as a tool for spreading scientific knowledge and innovation, he says. ""It was popular literature in China, but it has become more and more serious, touching very sensitive societal issues. In fact it has become a completely new genre."" Similarly, Wu Yan sees science fiction as a way of exploring philosophy. ""After Arthur C. Clarke's 2001: A Space Odyssey, Rendezvous with Rama, and The Fountains of Paradise were translated we were amazed to find they were not just about science. We had thought that this was what science fiction talked about, but then we realized it was not just about science but philosophy and religion as well. All of this came as a shock. My generation born in the 1960s greatly respected Clarke."" Two young women writers especially focus on how ordinary people's lives are changing in China. ""Many science fiction works focus on interplanetary relations and the science of the distant future, but here works look at ordinary people's lives,"" Xia says. ""What I'm trying to do is to imagine the near future of ordinary Chinese people's lives, which is also a way to reflect how we feel about the current time. So you can see that some of my stories happen in a Chinese core family with the parents, child and old people. The technological revolution changes their relationships. I want to explore the positive side of this change rather than just the dark side. For example, I try to explore how ordinary people can use these technologies to rebuild their relationships, to keep their traditional feelings and values during this process."",Hao Jingfang, the 2016 Hugo Award winner for best novelette, says: ""I am interested in people's minds, what they are thinking about, and the differences between people in everyday life. I really like studying these kinds of details in people. So I always write about stuff not that far removed from real life. Perhaps one day I will try to write about some far away universal empire or something like that."" Hao's Folding Beijing deals with the inequality that has developed during rapid growth. Hao, who gained a PhD in economics at Tsinghua University in Beijing and is now deputy director of a macroeconomics research department at the China Development Research Foundation, says her professional work does not deal with inequality directly. ""I do projects on topics such as urbanization and government spending and we also look at what impact technological development will have on the job market."" Ji Shaoting, founder and chief executive of the Future Affairs Administration company in Beijing, argues that rapid change is a direct progenitor of China's new science fiction. ""Behind the golden age of science fiction in the US was fast developing science. So right now in China science and technology is developing so fast that it changes people's lives every day. Forget money because you can now pay by phone; You can pick up and rent a bicycle anywhere; and with a quick phone call you can have food delivered to you. People can feel our country reaching to the stars, and they are focusing on that."" China is developing so fast that people can feel the impact of science and technology, Ji says. ""Science fiction is about the relationship between people and science. So now that science fiction is developing so rapidly, it means people are conscious of it. I always tell my colleagues and investors - and science fiction fans - that if there is any place the golden age can return to, it's China."" davidblair@chinadaily.com.cn"
0,"The Beijing festival, which opens on Oct 8, always features world-class musicians and concerts. Chen Jie reports. October is the main season for classical music fans in the capital as the Beijing Music Festival always features world-class musicians and concerts. This year, the annual festival has a unique program to mark its 20th anniversary. Yu Long, the artistic director of BMF will conduct the China Philharmonic Orchestra, of which he is also the music director, to open the festival on Oct 8. The orchestra will perform with violinist Frank Peter Zimmermann and his violinist son Serge Zimmermann. Then, in the next 22 days, the festival will feature 29 performances including three operas and children's concerts, lectures, masters-classes and opening rehearsals. The highlights include Wagner's opera  all of Beethoven's symphonies by Deutsche Kammer Philharmonie Bremen, an orchestral marathon by nine of China's symphony orchestras and concerts dedicated to Chinese composers and works. The BMF has presented 48 operas since it began in 1998. And 26 of them have made their debuts in China. Wagner seems to be the favorite, though German composers' operas are not as popular as Italian ones like   or  . The BMF has staged Wagner's    and    and  .,  In 2005, it took 15 hours over four nights for The Ring Cycle premiere in China. This year, BMF has co-produced Die Walkure with the Salzburg Easter Festival. In 1967, the first Salzburg Easter Festival presented Richard Wagner's  also known as  conducted by Herbert von Karajan (1908-89). This year, to mark the 50th anniversary of the festival, the Bulgarian director, Vera Nemirova, has produced Die Walkure, one section of the cycle, based on the original version of Karajan. ""This revival not only brings back the historical Karajan creation, but poses questions as how the play is to be reinterpreted for our time,"" says Yu. The Beijing production will feature an international cast and the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra under the baton of Jaap Van Zweden. Meanwhile, to mark the 190th anniversary of Beethoven's death, the BMF has invited The Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bermen to perform all nine of Beethoven's symphonies. ""Beethoven is no stranger to Chinese audiences. And when talking about classical music, most people focus on Beethoven, Mozart or Tchaikovsky. ""And Beethoven's   and Tchaikovsky's   are very popular.,  ""But it's very rare, actually, it's the first time to have all 9 of Beethoven's symphonies in a few days in Beijing,"" says Tu Song, BMF's Music Festival program director. The other ""large"" program is an ""Orchestral Marathon""－nine of China's orchestras, each conducted by their music director, performing in turn, for 10 hours from 10 am to 10 pm with a 2-hour break, on Oct 14. Then, at the end of the day, selected musicians from each orchestra will form ""The Beijing Music Festival Orchestra"" to play Tchaikovsky's   under the baton of Yu. Speaking about the program, Li Nan, the deputy director of the China Philharmonic Orchestra, who has worked with Yu since the beginning of the BMF and the CPO, says: ""It's an idea came to my mind some 20 years ago when we were just starting the festival. ""I bet that classical music is the genre that has developed the fastest in China in last two decades,"" says Li, adding: ""In 1995, it took a China orchestra two months to rehearse Shostakovich's  . But now a Mahler piece only takes two to three hours. ""China has some 70 orchestras. And many have regular seasons, well-prepared programs and tour around the world. ""So, it is time to do such a 'festival orchestra' to let leading musicians sit together."",  Though some of the world's leading musicians believe that China is the future of classical music, Yu and Li both say that what China's classical music scene needs is more music works. Yu says: ""We have few choices of Chinese works when we tour abroad, except for the violin concerto   or the folk song  . We need contemporary works."" To ensure this, since the first BMF in 1998, the duo have staged a program every year devoted to original works by Chinese composers. As a result, Tan Dun, Guo Wenjing, Zhou Long, Ye Xiaogang, Chen Qigang and other Chinese composers who have enjoyed fame in the Western world, have all presented their works at BMF. On Oct 16, the Beijing Symphony Orchestra will perform a concert featuring an all-Chinese program comprising Guo Wenjing's  Zhang Qianyi's   and Zhou Long's  － . And at the closing concert on Oct 29, the China Philharmonic Orchestra will perform the world premiere of Chen Qigang's  . Maxim Vengerov will play the violin for the piece which was commissioned by the Beijing Music Festival. ""A Chinese work played by a China orchestra featuring an international soloist. It's a nice way to have the Chinese voice heard by the world,"" says Yu. Contact the writer at chenjie@chinadaily.com.cn"
1,"Welcoming nearly 57 million tourists, China accounts for over 20 percent of international arrivals in the Asia-Pacific region. Although only 5 percent of its population has a passport, China is also the largest source market in the region, with 127.9 million departures in 2015. But Chinese tourism is not just about foreigners or foreign travel; travel within China is on the rise. China's domestic tourism industry earned about 3.9 trillion yuan ($563.6 billion) in 2016, up 14 percent from the year before. The numbers are staggering: Domestic tourists made 4.4 billion trips last year, an 11 percent increase from 2015. But where are these travelers going? According to China Highlights, a travel agency, the top 10 destinations in China are: 1. Beijing to see both the Great Wall and the Forbidden City 2. Xi'an to discover the Terracotta Army 3. Shanghai, Suzhou and Hangzhou by bullet train 4. Chengdu to see giant pandas 5. Zhangjiajie to witness one of the beautiful scenic areas in China 6. Huangshan to hike the magical Yellow Mountains 7. Guilin to immerse yourself in the classic Chinese countryside 8. Hong Kong, classic and scenic – and a shopping paradise 9. Pingyao to discover a wonderfully preserved ancient city 10. Chongqing, the best place to start a Yangtze cruise The Chinese government has stated that it plans to work to develop tourism into a major driver of economic transformation. By 2020, investment in tourism is expected to grow to 2 trillion yuan, and the sector will contribute more than 12 percent of GDP. But what should China focus on to enhance its travel and tourism competitiveness? What strengths should it build on and what are the areas that it could develop further? Every year, we release the Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report at the World Economic Forum, which ranks countries based on a range of policies in place to enable the sustainable development of the sector. The report looks at factors such as, how easy it is to do business in a country, specific travel and tourism policies, infrastructure, and natural and cultural resources. As you may imagine, China continues to deliver a very strong performance, rising two positions in the index to reach 15th place. You might not be surprised to find out that beautiful natural scenery like the Zhangye Danxia landform and iconic cultural landmarks like the Great Wall aren't the only factors that contribute to China's competitiveness. It has also benefited from increased international openness, which went up 24 positions in this edition. China has improved its Information Communications Technology (ICT) readiness and its ground and tourist service infrastructure through further investments. At the same time, it has increasingly prioritized travel and tourism, which has further supported this rise. To continue to rise in the rankings, China could further enhance its competitiveness by creating more accommodation capacity beyond the larger cities. It could also develop a more enabling environment for doing business. While environmental sustainability (132nd) remains a challenge, China has shifted its focus to this critical issue, which will hopefully in turn ensure the preservation of its unique natural resources."
1,"Like millions of working women in China, Tracy Liu too rides the subway home, but with a difference. While most of her peers are busy chatting on phones or engaging in conversation, the Beijing-based 25-year-old office worker spends her time reading English novels on Mint Reading, an English-reading program installed on the WeChat platform by Chengdu Chaoyouai Education Technology. Liu spends 149 yuan ($21.4) to purchase content on Mint Reading, which typically allows her to read three novels within 100 days. What is different is that the interactive app is not just about reading novels, but also brushing up one's vocabulary and knowledge, said Liu as she focused her attention to the next chapter of The Great Gatsby, F Scott Fitzgerald's 1925 classic. Once she logs into the course, she will go through the daily vocabulary list, read a chapter and then answer questions based on the story. And what really motivates her is the last step, sharing her daily effort, or in other words the number of words she has read, on her WeChat. ""I am too busy to find suitable time to read books and improve myself. The fragmented time on the subway actually provides me with a learning opportunity, while the sharing allows me to show my friends that I am studying hard and in turn wins me lots of likes on WeChat,"" said Liu. Liu and Mint Reading are just one of the millions of people and startups who are looking to carve out a niche in China's rapidly growing knowledge sharing economy, where paid content is king. Xue Yongfeng, an analyst at Beijing-based internet consultancy Analysys, said that customers are now willing to pay for virtual content whereas earlier they were willing to do so only if it was something physical that they could relate to. ""With income levels rising and new payment options emerging, netizens are now more willing to pay for their favorite content,"" Xue said. And statistics do bear the fact that the online paid knowledge market is on the cusp of a boom in China. Last year, the industry generated more than 4.9 billion yuan in economic output, up 300 percent year-on-year, according to a recent industry report from iResearch, a market consultancy firm. Buoyed by the gradual increase in market awareness and the growing number of users who are willing to pay for high-quality knowledge services, the online paid knowledge market in China is set to maintain relatively high growth in the next three years and reach 23.5 billion yuan by 2020, the report said. The report said there would be a slowdown in the traditional publishing, education, media and other related sectors, while skilled professionals will flood into the knowledge services industry that has a short monetization process and huge potential for growth. On one hand, the knowledge market will further expand in the future. On the other hand, limited by the attention of individual users and the range of acceptable per customer transactions of targeted users, its growth rate will decline and become stable eventually, it said. Guan Qingyou, director and chief economist at Rushi Advanced Institute of Finance, believes that knowledge consumption is growing steadily in China due to the increase of mid-income earners and consumption upgrading. ""The existing content on offer is unable to satisfy market demand, and specialized knowledge will be the future,"" Guan said at a payment summit held in Beijing in June. ""Currently, the market does not lack good payment channels, but it lacks high-quality content. And people are actually willing to pay for good content."" Guan added for the paid knowledge content providers, the biggest obstacle was the sustainability of the content rather than consumer demand. According to a report published by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the Social Sciences Academic Press, most of the paid knowledge consumers are between 21 and 40 years old. Born in the 1980s and 1990s, these millennials are mainly living in first-and second-tier cities, usually earning 5,000 yuan to 8,000 yuan a month. Those young groups are usually newcomers or middle-level manager in companies, having a higher requirement for practical skills and knowledge content. However, their fragmented spare time cannot support continuous course learning, and it is really hard for them to select needed knowledge content from a vast amount of online information. This is where the high-quality paid content comes in and helps them gain access to learning materials they really need. According to the report, the online paid knowledge market boasted 188 million users by the end of 2017, compared to 93 million users by 2016. Sensing the boom in the market, a growing number of companies have made their moves and some have even reaped the fruits. Audio sharing platform Ximalaya has seen rapid growth since it tapped into the paid content business in 2016 to encourage professionals to sell their knowledge online. For instance, the paid music course by Tian Yimiao, an associate professor at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, has gained more than 13 million views on the Ximalaya platform, making Tian a new online celebrity. ""In the mobile era, everyone's time is getting fragmented,"" Ximalaya said in an email to China Daily. ""Our goal is not to occupy users' time, but help them save time. Compared with traditional offline education training, audio content will help users make full use of their fragmented time, catering to their specific needs."" Statistics from app tracker Analysys Qianfan show Ximalaya is the largest audiobook platform in terms of active user numbers, with more than 70 million monthly active users in September. Ximalaya claimed the online knowledge payment sector is currently at the very early stage of development, and it still lacks a huge amount of high-quality content in various categories. ""The key is providing content that has practical uses. In-depth and professional content will be the future, and it is of great importance to focus on the social and community functions on the platform,"" the company said. According to the company, professionals from the education sector and grassroots entrepreneurs are quickly occupying the market as there is immense potential in segments like history and self-improvement content. Statistics from market research company iiMedia Research show that 63.6 percent of surveyed paid content consumers aim to gain professional knowledge and 50.3 percent of the consumers paid for the content out of personal interest. ""With people embracing a new era of online knowledge payment, platforms will continuously offer a series of quality content to meet their growing need for lifelong learning. But competition in the market segments will also be fiercer in the near future,"" iiMedia said."
0,"A national political adviser called for a national strategy and the involvement of the entire society on Sunday to curb the increasing rate of nearsightedness. Wang Ningli, also head of the Ophthalmologic Center at Beijing Tongren Hospital, said at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing that the success of myopia prevention efforts was in the participation of parents and society as a whole. Wang said levels of nearsightedness are now very severe in China and that many children in kindergarten have myopia. There is also a high rate of myopia and weak eyesight among Chinese juveniles. He also said schools alone cannot do the job and it is vital that parents realize that shortsightedness is a serious threat to health. Parents and schools should work together to ensure at least one and half hours of outdoor activity every day for students, as well as a reduced academic workload and that less time was spent on electronic devices, Wang added. With myopia levels rising, the Ministry of Education and the National Health Commission issued a draft guideline in August laying out measures to tackle the problem among schoolchildren."

The Olympic Games definitely has given Beijing a face lift and the city looks totally different. I came back right on the verge of the Chinese Lunar New Year. The streets lined with red lanterns and trees strung with budding lights from root to tip; The Christmas holiday has definitely become both an economic venture and a welcome mat to many foreigners. Glowing Chinese characters, large and colored boldly mark the roof tops of high rises and glass sky scrapers. Beijing in the winter is known to be one of the coldest place and amazingly I have gotten adjusted to the cold very quickly that most times I never notice it. China is definitely pushing forward to make its mark on the world and to obtain the highest position it can achieve. With business on an all time height in the newest Economic Power there are many new opportunities.   Food in Beijing has exploded into a whole array of all you can eat. There is Thai food, Japanese food, Korean, Vietnamese, Moroccan, Italian, Tibetan, Persian, Pakistani, Persian, Italian, Indian, and Vietnamese. Food, food, food everywhere! Even Vegetarian places! There is food for days! I have certainly had a warm welcome, even by strangers I just met. There is much to see as Beijing is a large cultural hub in China and one can enjoy many tourist and local sites alike. My Mandarin language skills are developing rapidly in both written and oral and there is plenty of opportunity to use both. I enjoy meeting people from all over and it is important to me to build, network, learn and share with others. I have even made close Chinese friends and that means a lot to me.  In the past I noticed there were two experiences one could have here as a person of African descent and those two experiences seem to have grown along those lines. One is an experience in which black is exotic; where curiosity of blackness drives the interaction and or relations. You may be asked to pose for a photo with someone. Your hair and skin will spark ooos and ahhhs and drive some to reach out to touch or ask you how you made your hair like that. You may be bombarded with comments on how you are so beautiful, or so handsome, or black is so nice. In this case black is beautiful, black is exotic, black is erotic, black is cool, black is mysterious.  On the opposite end of the black experience in China is the Afrophobic experience where black is scary, dangerous, unintelligent, and poor. It seems that both experiences are fueled by perceptions and not enough genuine interaction and knowledge between the two groups of people. African Americans and Chinese have much to learn from each other and much to share with each other to foster cultural ties and economic business as well! Nowadays things are much more different and there you are rarely started at. There is no one rushing to touch my hair or anything like that. Progress is always good. 2012 is the year of the dragon and while things may not always seem clear. This is a year in which I see many great things will happen. Great culture, great experiences, and great business! I am inspired and would like to inspire other African Americans to expand economically by looking East.

0,"China looks forward to the success of the top leaders' meeting and bilateral dialogue between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the United States, President Xi Jinping said. Beijing hopes substantial progress will be made toward denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula and normalizing their relations, Xi said when meeting on Monday with Chung Eui-yong, special envoy and top national security adviser for Republic of Korea President Moon Jae-in. Chung visited Pyongyang and Washington last week and announced in the US capital on Thursday that US President Donald Trump would meet DPRK top leader Kim Jong-un by May to achieve permanent denuclearization. China appreciates Moon's dispatching Chung to China to provide a briefing on Chung's visits to the DPRK and the US and his effort to promote DPRK-US dialogue, Xi said. Chung, who leads the National Security Office of the Blue House, said positive changes have taken place in the peninsula's situation and China has played an important, navigating role. The envoy noted that China always has upheld the goal of denuclearizing the peninsula as well as the peaceful settlement of the DPRK nuclear issue, and it supports direct US-DPRK dialogue. China has supported the major step taken in ROK-DPRK ties, which has led to the positive developments on the peninsula issue, Chung added. The ROK expressed its sincere appreciation to China, Chung said. During Monday's meeting, Xi said as long as all parties involved stay focused on the fundamental aim－the peninsula's denuclearization, peace and stability－the ice will melt and warmth will return to the peninsula. There is now an important opportunity for easing tension and promoting dialogue, and China has spoken positively of the efforts made by the ROK, Xi said. China is willing to continue to work with the international community, including the ROK, communicate with all concerned parties and promote the political settlement of the peninsula issue through China's dual-track approach and conducive suggestions from all sides, Xi said. Also, the parties involved should be patient and careful, give full play to their political wisdom and properly deal with and eliminate problems and disturbances in the process of restarting dialogue, Xi added. China has always supported both sides of the peninsula in improving their relations and promoting reconciliation and cooperation, and has supported contacts and dialogue between the US and the DPRK and their consultations for addressing each others' concerns, Xi said. Achieving peninsula denuclearization and preventing war or turmoil there comprise China's consistent position, he said. Seoul hopes Beijing continues playing an important role. The ROK is willing to closely coordinate with Beijing to maintain the current momentum and promote peaceful settlement of the DPRK nuclear issue, Chung said."
1,"The market size of Chinese K12 (kindergarten through 12th grade) education has doubled in the past five years and the pace is expected to continue in the next five years, according to Edwin Chen, co-head of Asian small/mid-caps research of UBS Securities. The driving force behind the continued growth of Chinese K12 education market can be largely attributed to the country’s ongoing urbanization, the second-child policy, rise in income which has resulted in growing demand for differentiated educational resources, and the inadequate supply of public educational resources, said Chen. He also said that over 90 percent of the K12 industry practitioners used to be teachers working at public schools, or those working for small-sized studios. Major industry players such as Beijing-headquartered New Oriental Education and Technology Group and Beijing-based Tomorrow Advancing Life accounted for less than 10 percent of the market share. Even though in first-tier cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, these two industry leaders only took up 15 percent and 12 percent of the local K12 education market share respectively. “But the trend for 2018 and the next few years is that such large educational groups will see their market share increase, as the central government tightens its grip on the regulation of public school teachers taking other posts at other institutions,” he said. With their market share further consolidating, the leading educational groups will probably reach into other courses which they did not touch upon in the past and reach for students of other age groups to seek more rapid growth. While a large number of public educational companies have been discussing about the adoption of artificial intelligence technology into educational scenarios, the use of this technology is still confined to preliminary attempts such as face recognition. There is no clear business model at present, he said."

The business generates 200 million yuan ($29 million) in annual sales, and the duo want to expand it further. As live-streaming becomes popular, they decided to move their brick-and-mortar store online and boost sales on Taobao via online broadcasting. Tongtong's mother first started clothing business in Shanghai back in 2003 and then opened ""Hui Hui Factory"" in Changshu, East China's Jiangsu province, in 2007. After learning performance art in Beijing, Tongtong joined the family business and established her own brand and fashion studio in 2010. Although she is outgoing, Tongtong still felt nervous while live broadcasting but thanks to her mother's extensive experiences in clothing sales, the first live-streaming was successful in early December. With attention from about 50,000 fans, the sales promoted by the show surpassed Tongtong's expectations. Tongtong, who has already achieved financial freedom, considered it another opportunity in life and wanted to seize it to serve the female customers who are choosing clothes for their husband, lovers and children.

1,"The average monthly salary of food couriers in China last year was 7,750 yuan ($1,141), even higher than some white-collar jobs, according to a report from the country's leading life services platform, 58.com. The report released on Monday shows that food couriers in Hangzhou city of East China's Zhejiang province lead the way with a monthly salary of 9,121 yuan, followed by Beijing, Nanjing and Shanghai with 9,072 yuan, 8,728 yuan and 8,481 yuan, respectively. Currently, the demand for food delivery workers exceeds the supply, and enterprises are eager to hire more. Food couriers are actually paid more than they expect, mainly because their overall income is higher than that of other occupations, such as administrative and clerical positions, the report said. The report also shows that China's first-tier cities and new first-tier cities had the most demand for and supply of professional talents. The top 10 cities with the highest demand for delivery drivers are Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Chongqing, Nanjing, Wuhan, Hangzhou and Xi 'an.,The main reason is that people in these cities are busier and have a better sense of time, so they tend to choose convenient take-out food instead of cooking or eating out. The number of delivery drivers is quite large in first - and second-tier cities, and has a trend of gradually covering third - and fourth-tier cities. Also, the food is delivered to more places, from residences and office buildings to hotels and hospitals. A user on microblog Sina Weibo said, "" How I envy them! I want to quit my job and be a food delivery worker"", but some held a different view, that the delivery couriers work so hard to deliver packages every day."

The Ministry of Environmental Protection has drawn up a series of plans for the regional campaign, which will start soon, Liu Youbin, a senior official from the ministry's publicity department, said on Tuesday. In addition to the general action plan for the campaign, officials will keep track of every issue reported and how it was resolved, Liu said. Another six supportive documents were prepared with detailed stipulations on the key regions and industries, as well as to ensure the timely disclosure of problems to the public. Those documents also list punishments that irresponsible government officials can expect during the campaign, he said, responding to reports that some disclosed pollution issues were not resolved. ""In the coming campaign, the ministry and involved governments will take efforts to keep the polluting companies from resuming production or will relocate them to other areas－and then fully implement the control measures,"" he said. The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, prone to suffer through severe smog in the autumn and winter months, faces a large risk of air pollution returning in the coming months, the ministry said on Sunday. This past January and February, the concentration of PM2.5－hazardous fine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 microns－soared due to the severe air pollution in the region. This was caused by a confluence of several factors, including windless weather, active production, coal consumption for heating and vehicle exhaust, Liu said. The ministry's data showed that in the first seven months, the region's PM2.5 average concentration increased by 11.3 percent year-on-year. The average PM2.5 concentration in the region should by the end of this year be cut by 25 percent from the 2012 level. Beijing needs to lower its PM2.5 level to 60 micrograms per cubic meter, as the central government required in 2013. The capital saw the average PM2.5 level fall to 52 in July, but in January it was as high as 116, a year-on-year increase of 70.6 percent. To tackle the air pollution, the ministry has conducted a yearlong inspection of 28 major cities in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and the neighboring provinces of Shandong, Shanxi and Henan, which began in April. The latest data from the ministry showed that through Aug 20, inspectors have checked 40,925 companies, of which 55 percent, or 22,620, were found with various pollution problems, such as discharging pollutants excessively or not installing emission-reduction equipment. ""Besides, these cities have found over 170,000 small and polluting companies, which should be shut down or improve their pollution reduction facilities,"" said Bie Tao, head of the policy and laws department of the ministry, on Tuesday."

Beijing and Shanghai, as well as Guangdong, Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have more than 100 AI companies each. By 2020, China's AI industry is expected to reach 150 billion yuan ($23.6 billion), said Wang."
1,"Young people accountfor more than 50 percent of the nearly 100 million users of Qyer.comand have gradually become the main force of outbound travel, according to a report from the Chinese travel information website. The report analyzed the outbound travel preferences of Chinese in 2018,along with new travel trends of post-1990s and post-2000s tourists. TV series, variety shows and international competitions are inspirations for those young travelers. Data shows 35.71 percent of the post-2000 generation and 21.26 percent of the post-1990 generation choose their destinations based on variety shows. About 75 percent of post-2000s and 50.28 percent of post-1990s will start a trip because of a TV series or movie. 21.43 percent of post-2000s will embark on a journey because of their idols. According to the report, the number of outbound tourists has increased steadily over the past decade. From 2010 to 2017, the compound annual growth rate of outbound tourists reached 12.27 percent. As of 2018, the number of valid passports for private use has reached 130 million. In other words, 90 percent of Chinese have not entered the outbound tourism market, which means the overall penetration rate of outbound tourism still has huge growth potential. Niche destinations, once thought to be fashionable among only a select group of people, have reversed course in 2018. Croatia, Mexico and Portugal rankedamongthe top 30 ""budget destinations""for the first time. The rise of niche destinations is influenced by visa policies. In 2018, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Belarus and other newly added visa-free destinations saw their popularity rise immediately after the announcement of visa-free policies. Chinese outbound tourism is more diversified in terms of activities and plans. For instance, skydiving, paraglidingand diving are growing by 30 percent at Qyer.com. Skiing, music festivals, hiking, RV travel, surfing, self-driving and other ways of exploring are becoming popular among travelers. In addition, the report also interprets travel behaviorof people fromfourregions:Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Shanghai, the Pearl River Delta and southwestern China. Travelers from the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebe region prefer self-driven, long-term journeysand are the biggest spenders. Affected by geographical location, different regions have diverse choices in destinations. Osaka, Kyoto and Tokyo are favored by tourists from Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai, since they are relatively close to each other. Travelers from the Pearl River Delta like destinations in Southeast Asia, while those from the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and southwest regions prefer European countries."

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Morgulov said Russia has drafted, and is ready to discuss with its partners, a road map on denuclearization and overall peace on the Korean Peninsula that includes a phased plan to bring the parties toward dialogue without preconditions, Russia's Sputnik News Agency and Radio reported on Tuesday.  Morgulov said Russia supports China's proposals to solve the issue and opposes unilateral sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea that aim to put an ""economic chokehold"" on Pyongyang.  ""China welcomes and is open-minded about any constructive efforts that will help to push forward the denuclearization of the peninsula and maintain peace and stability in the region,"" Lu said at a daily news conference in Beijing.  China and Russia are ""in close communication"" through their comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination, and the two sides are ""coordinating on international and regional issues"", Lu said.  China has a ""dual track"" approach to denuclearizing the peninsula and ensuring peace. It includes a suspension of Pyongyang's nuclear and missile activities, as well as a cessation of large-scale military drills by the United States and the Republic of Korea.  ""The proposals - which aim to solve the most urgent concerns of all parties and find a breakthrough for resuming talks - have won increasing understanding and support from other countries,"" Lu said. ""They also coincide with Russia's proposal, and the two sides are currently staying in close communication on the road map for settlement of the peninsula nuclear issue.""  Lu added that the US and DPRK are direct parties to the issue and hold the keys to solving it.  ""China would be glad to see the two sides improve ties through direct talks and create conditions for settlement,"" he said.  Li Yonghui, a senior researcher of Russian foreign policy at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that the peninsula nuclear issue has affected the security and stability of Northeast Asia and that denuclearization serves the common interests of China and Russia.  ""The two countries' coordination and cooperation on this issue will help to solve the crisis and maintain regional peace and stability, as well as set up a new security mechanism in Northeast Asia,"" she said."
0,"Three districts in Beijing are rolling out electronic parking meters to improve order on the city's roadsides. More than 13,000 electronic parking meters have been installed along the roads in Beijing's Dongcheng, Xicheng and Tongzhou districts, Rong Jun, deputy director of the city's municipal transport commission, said at a news conference during the second session of the 15th Beijing Municipal People's Congress on Jan 15. Rong said 166 roads with 13,644 parking spaces in three pilot districts will be reorganized. ""It also will become much easier for drivers to tell which areas are suitable for parking,"" he said. The electronic devices will measure how long a car is parked and calculate the fee. More than 500,000 vehicles park along the capital's streets every night, according to the city's transport commission, while there are only 70,000 marked spots. This results in cars randomly parked on the streets, occupying bicycle lanes, community green spaces and fire access lanes. Huang Yubin, 32, from Haidian district who had been driving in Beijing for eight years, said the parking difficulties had bothered him some time. ""Especially in downtown areas, such as Wangfujing Street, I need to spend twice the time to search for the right parking spot, and the fee is also double,"" he said. ""The electronic toll will open up more spaces and save me time."" A driver for Didi, the car-hailing service, surnamed Zhang, said finding a parking spot is a headache for him every night. He said the electronic parking fees might be higher as the city's current parking standard doesn't charge for the first 15 minutes. In the daytime it costs 2.5 yuan for every 15 minutes, and 15 yuan per hour at night, Zhang said. ""When the electronic meters are put into use, the meters will be more accurate."" Parking signs in Beijing have been upgraded, and some parking spots have been highlighted with white lines. According to the city's municipal transport commission, six districts in the downtown area of the capital will be using the electronic parking meters by July. Deputies and experts at the city's two sessions applauded the move. Pei Hongwei, president of the Beijing Municipal Road and Bridge Group, a deputy to the Beijing People's Congress, said, ""The move will also largely solve the capital's urban disease by making roads much cleaner."""
0,"The Chinese capital's first artificial intelligence robot for legal services was put into operation in a Beijing court on Thursday. The robot, named Xiaofa, stands 1.46 meters tall and provides legal advice and guidance in a child's voice. ""Xiaofa explains complicated legal terms in everyday language to help the public better understand legal definitions,"" said Du Xiangyang, founder and CEO of AEGIS Data, which designed Xiaofa. ""We used a child's voice to ease the tense emotions of litigants who come here for help."" The robot can move its head and wave its hands as instructions show up on screen, and it can guide people to the exact service window for litigation services. The appearance of Xiaofa was a big move for the Beijing court, as the capital works to build a ""smart"" court system. Over 40,000 litigation questions and 30,000 legal issues can be answered by the robot, according to the court. ""Interaction between humans and machines has improved immensely,"" said Ma Laike, deputy head of Beijing No 1 Intermediate People's Court. ""It will decrease the cost of litigation, save trial resources and improve the efficiency of justice."" Before the robot was introduced into the Beijing court system, it was tested by legal professionals. In October 2016, China's first AI legal robot, Faxiaotao, was unveiled in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, attracting visitors from home and abroad. Faxiaotao can help people analyze the best way to solve a dispute, and also assist them in selecting which attorneys are suitable to accept the case, according to the robot's designer, Itslaw, a company that combines internet technology with law. For example, if a company's corporate client believes its advertisements or advertising slogans have been illegally copied by a rival company and would like to hire an attorney who is a specialist, Faxiaotao will first recognize what kind of case it is and then analyze its database for suitable lawyers who have dealt with similar disputes. More than 300,000 attorneys across the country were listed in the company's database last year. When a query is made it selects the best three options, the company said. The Supreme People's Court has ordered Chinese courts at all levels to build technology-friendly systems for lawsuits and explore the use of big data and AI to help judges and litigants search documents and resolve cases. An internal intelligent system covers 3,520 courts across the country, giving the courts access to a great deal of information online."

Nearly 20 bamboo landscapes, including mottled bamboo, dwarf bamboo, and black bamboo, will be on display at INBAR Garden in the 2019 Expo to showcase special local elements and help tourists have a better understanding of bamboo culture, said Sun Jian, deputy mayor of Meishan city, at a press conference on Tuesday in Beijing.,The INBAR Garden, covering a total area of 1,200 square meters, is a main pavilion on the east side of the expo site at the foot of the Great Wall in Beijing's Yanqing district. By adopting 5,000 moso bamboos for construction, the garden had reached its highest height of 32 meters, making it the largest bamboo structure in northern China. The pavilion also is known as the Eye of Bamboo due to its unique shape.,Zhu Yujian, director of the Chinese Events Management Department at the International Bamboo and Rattan Organization, said the organization sought cooperation with Meishan to fully use its local elements, especially distinguished culture elements to combine bamboo with handcrafted weaving. Zhu said the eye-catching pavilion includes a special outdoor ecological device to provide more convenience for upcoming visitors in summer. Called the Air Tower, the 7-meter high round construction combines solar energy and wind energy to form a special ventilation layer, which will lower the temperature for tourists, she said.

1,"As China's internet companies have shown the world how their innovation could decide where the internet is going, it's imperative for them to be present when rules governing the internet are set and reviewed, Jia-Rong Low, vice-president of California-based, nonprofit organization Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) told chinadaily.com.cn on April 24 in Beijing. He said that since ICANN rolled out the New Generic Top-Level Domains (gTLD) program in 2012, the Chinese government has been an active and open-minded entity that has helped in facilitating the program in the country. Any TLD that does not represent a country or a territory is known as a generic TLD, or gTLD, for example, .shop, .phone, according to ICANN. Since the launch of the new gTLD program, the internet has evolved from just 22 gTLDs to over 1,200 new gTLDs in the root, Low said, adding that out of these 1,200 new gTLDs, more than 100 new gTLD applications were specifically for Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) featuring domain names in various native languages other than English. Of the top 100 new gTLDs by registration, six of the TLDs are IDN TLDs from China, suggesting that there is a huge demand for domain names in Chinese, he said. Anyone could log onto the official website by typing 国家开发银行.网址, the Chinese domain name of China Development Bank in any browser, a China Daily reporter found out Wednesday. Similarly, the official website of Bank of Communications also could be reached by typing its Chinese domain name 交通银行.网址. Low said that China's internet penetration rate stands at 54 percent and the IDNs can help bring the other half of the population online. According to a report on china.com Wednesday, Baidu will step up its efforts in collecting and showcasing Chinese domain names. The search engine added that if a website preferred to display its Chinese domain name, it could apply to Baidu and after review, the Chinese domain name would be shown to anyone who wanted to connect to the website. However, there are still challenges for ICANN to fully engage Chinese stakeholders, especially businesses, to the ICANN community for further discussions on the domain name system evolution. He said the reasons might be multi-fold. Domain names are not top concerns for companies that chase market share, innovation and dollars, but there is an indirect correlation between additional market share and Chinese domain names, which takes time for them to realize. In addition, the English language might still be a barrier for Chinese businesses to share their attitude and proposals, and traditionally, Chinese culture discourages disagreement in public. But things are improving as Chinese companies are growing and if they are not at the table when decisions on how the internet should be governed, they may miss some opportunities, Low said."

On Sept 4, 37 young performers from 12 countries gave a concert in Beijing, offering the audience a musical feast to tell the story of China over the past 40 years. The concert was part of this year's iSING! Suzhou International Young Artists Festival, a program to train young vocal artists and to promote cultural exchanges. Potential foreign and Chinese artists were selected from three continents to receive one month of training from some of the world's most respected opera coaches, before making performances in East China's Suzhou city as well as Shanghai and Beijing. ""I have known about this program for nearly seven years. I thought being a participant is something that I would never be able to achieve. Therefore, coming here is like fulfilling my dream,"" says Milica Jovi?i?, a performer from Serbia.,The selected performers focused on improving their vocal abilities and learning Mandarin lyric voice during the one month. To commemorate China's reform and opening-up, which began in 1978, the performance included popular Chinese songs from different times over the past four decades, such as     and . Performers also sang several beloved foreign pieces, such as  and ""Singing is an ideal way for us to exchange culture and ideas, and to make connections,"" says Juliet Petrus, a US performer who joined the program for a third time. According to the art director Tian Haojiang, by inviting foreign artists to China, they get an opportunity to approach China and its culture. Chinese artists, in turn, can also have the chance to stand on international stages.,When he appeared in an opera 17 years ago in Italy, he found foreign musicians had a very limited understanding of Chinese culture, not to mention Chinese music. He wondered why the cultural exchange is so imbalanced. Many Chinese musicians go abroad and know Western culture very well, but their Western counterparts are so unfamiliar with Chinese culture. ""I can sing Western operas in six foreign languages. Why can't Westerners sing in Chinese?"" says Tian. He decided to change the situation by setting up iSING!. Over the past eight years, the program has selected about 160 singers from over 3,000 applicants to join in, with many participants having won prizes in international competitions. Tian and his group members also performed onstage at the 2018 Spring Festival Gala, or Chunwan in Chinese. ""I have achieved so many things in this group, including improving my professional skills and making good friends. We just come to iSING! and have fun,"" says Zhang Wenqin, a Chinese performer."

The platform would cover ""all procedures related to tax payment"" by setting up channels such as a website, mobile apps and WeChat account, said Zheng Huaiyuan, deputy director-general with the Beijing municipal office of the State Administration of Taxation. Integrated with cloud computing, big data and advanced internet technologies, the platform aims to smooth the way that the tax administration communicates with taxpayers and promote the efficiency of tax services, Zheng said. The SAT has been increasing efforts to achieve its goal of building a modern tax administration system. It has reduced the time spent paying taxes by 20 percent from 259 hours in 2015 to 207 hours in 2016; that is also a reduction of 75 percent since 2004, according to a report jointly issued by the World Bank Group and PwC, the brand name for PricewaterhouseCoopers. The Beijing tax administration made contributions to this progress, said Ning Bodong, director of the tax services division. Since 2015, the Beijing office has been working hard to enable taxpayers to file and pay taxes online. To date, nearly 90 percent of the basic daily work is accessible online. Taxpayers' average waiting times decreased by over 40 percent, Ning said."
1,"Great Wall Motor Co Ltd, one of China's major SUV manufacturers, has benefited from the national strategy for the integrated development of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei province. After President Xi Jinping initiated the strategy in 2014, transportation among the three neighbors has become more convenient. Great Wall Motor is headquartered in Baoding, Hebei province, about 150 kilometers southwest of Beijing and 180 km west of Tianjin. The Tianjin-Baoding high-speed train came into operation at the end of 2015. It shortened the travel time between Tianjin and Baoding to about one hour. The convenience helps companies such as Great Wall Motor to bring in skilled workers more easily from Beijing and Tianjin, which have abundant talent and research and development resources. Unlike companies that are encouraged to relocate from Beijing or Tianjin to Hebei, Great Wall Motor does not need to move and can enjoy the benefits of its location. To attract and keep talented workers, Baoding is also making efforts to catch up with Beijing and Tianjin in terms of facilities, education and medical services. ""This year, Hebei will strive to narrow the salary gap between the province and Beijing and Tianjin,"" said Yuan Tongli, deputy governor of Hebei. Beijing is increasing the amount of quality resources it exports to its cities in Hebei, which can help attract workers from the capital to move there, where living costs are much lower. Great Wall Motor sold 938,000 SUVs in 2016, seizing 10.4 percent of the domestic SUV market and retaining its No 1 position for 14 consecutive years. Zhang Wenhui, vice-president of Great Wall Motor, said the company's success is based on its technology and innovation. In 2015, Great Wall Motor spent nearly 2.8 billion yuan ($405.72 million) on R&D. To support such research, the company requires a significant inflow of top-level professionals: it now has more than 7,000 R&D-related employees. The past three years witnessed great progress in the region's cooperation in innovation-driven projects, according to the company, which led one such project. At the beginning of last year, Great Wall Motor and 14 companies from Beijing established an innovation center for developing smart vehicles and transportation."

Born after 1995 and a lover of fiction, the young man said he began the startup because it will not take up his time. ""People go to flower shops at any time,"" he said. ""I cannot focus on reading when I have to serve customers."" So Wang opened the self-service flower shop after doing market research. Most young customers like shopping in a free environment, and hate promotion from clerks, he explained, adding that customers can have their questions answered about categories and names of flowers through mobile apps. Even though there is no shopkeeper, the operation has attracted many young customers and proved to be a success, at least for now. Although he does not sell flowers in the shop in person, Wang said he would call at it at odd intervals everyday. ""It is a business with small investment, and it cannot cause a huge loss if a burglary occurs,"" he said, adding that he trusts people."

During the six-month campaign to protect IP rights, which began in July, supervisory departments inspected 63,000 websites, shut down 2,554 sites and deleted 710,000 links involved in pirated content. Law enforcement officers confiscated 2.76 million pirated items, including books, CDs and DVDs. Copyright authorities filed some 543 cases involving alleged online infringement. Of those, 57 were investigated with police cooperation. The annual campaign, Internet Sword, was launched in 2005 and aims to tackle online copyright infringement. ""Copyright supervisory departments targeted films, news, applications and e-commerce platforms ... and received marked results,"" said Yu Cike, director of copyright management for the National Copyright Administration. One major case was a Beijing company that illegally provided 30,000 unauthorized articles to readers on its digital library. The company made 177,600 yuan ($27,600) in profit from the pirated material. A copyright law enforcement squad launched an investigation after receiving a tip from five copyright holders, including publisher Elsevier. In July, the Beijing company was fined 400,000 yuan. ""It is one of the biggest fines in copyright enforcement punishment, showing some determination against copyright infringement,"" Xiong Wei, deputy head of the copyright squad of integrated law enforcement in the cultural market in Beijing, said in an earlier interview. New areas are also being watched, Yu said. In the latest battle, copyright authorities discovered the first case of virtual reality technology being used to spread pirated films. A smartphone app illegally re-edited and re-digitalized films－without copyright authorization－using virtual reality technology, and then posted the films on its platform. The films included Transformers and Ant-Man. Viewers were able to buy VR glasses through the app, download the pirated VR films and watch them on a mobile phone. The service started in July. The company was fined 30,000 yuan and it deleted the pirated films and clips from its app."

One of his most famous choreographic works is Red Detachment of Women, China's first original ballet production, which premiered in the capital in 1964 and is best known in the West as the ballet performed for former US president Richard Nixon during his visit to China in 1972. Based on a film by the same name, it tells the story of a rural girl, Wu Qionghua, who escapes a life of slavery and joins an all-female Communist Party army battalion led by commander Hong Changqing on Hainan Island during the civil war in the early 1930s. Li also played the ruthless landlord Nan Ba Tian in Red Detachment of Women then. ""Ballet in China has a nearly 60-year history. The key to Chinese ballet's growing popularity is its interest in telling homegrown stories and Red Detachment of Women is a landmark in the history of Chinese ballet,"" said Feng Ying, head of the National Ballet of China. ""Li had made great contribution to the development of China's ballet."" Feng notes that Red Detachment of Women is still popular today among middle-aged people and the younger generation, and has been touring worldwide. The National Ballet of China staged the ballet in Spain on Dec 5, marking the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries. ""Different generations of ballet dancers of the National Ballet of China perform the classic piece, which is a legacy left by Li,"" Feng adds. Feng graduated from the Beijing Dance Academy in 1979 and joined the National Ballet of China the same year. In 1980, she played the leading role in the ballet production Lin Daiyu, choreographed by Li, which was based on the main character, Lin Daiyu, in Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) writer Cao Xueqin's classic Chinese novel, Dream of the Red Chamber. Li, who was born in Harbin, Northeast China's Heilongjiang province, graduated from North China University, the predecessor of Renmin University of China, with a major of theater, and started working with the Central Academy of Drama as a dancer the same year. He was enrolled to study ballet in 1955 as the first group of students from Beijing Dance School under the guidance of Russian artists. In 1957, Li became the assistant teacher of the school when Russian dancer and choreographer Pyotr Gusev was the school's artistic director. The same year, under the instruction and direction of Russian experts, China staged La Fille Mal Gardee (The Wayward Daughter), a masterpiece created in the 18th century, with Li as one of the choreographers. With the founding of the National Ballet of China in 1959, Li played in the first three classic ballet productions adapted by the troupe: Swan Lake, Le Corsaire (The Pirate) and Giselle. ""He was not only a great choreographer but also a talented performer,"" said Zhao Ruheng, former president of National Ballet of China, who took the position in 1994 after Li's 10-year tenure. ""It was Li and the elder generation of Chinese ballet dancer-choreographers who laid a solid foundation for China's ballet. He witnessed the birth and development of Chinese ballet."""
0,"When it opened in 2008, Beijing South Railway Station was hailed by observers as a shining example of a modern rail transportation hub. The 32-hectare, oval-shaped station, which handled China's first high-speed trains, has been compared with New York's Grand Central and London King's Cross stations. But its star, which was expected to continue rising, has been falling in the eyes of many. As the number of passengers has expanded rapidly over the past decade, leaving and arriving at Beijing South has become an ordeal. Long lines form for taxis at the station, with unauthorized, ""black"" cabs that overcharge also operating in the area. Overcrowding is common on the concourse. As one of three major rail hubs in the capital, Beijing South mainly handles passengers traveling to or from Tianjin and Shanghai and Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Fujian provinces. About 400 bullet trains operate from the station every day, and during the summer travel rush it handles an average of about 154,000 passengers a day. From July 1 to Aug 31, the station is expected to see 9.53 million travelers. But based on growing complaints, many passengers appear unhappy with the services provided. Shen Peilan, a frequent commuter between Beijing and Shanghai, said, ""Randomly ask around about the experience at Beijing South, and even the most reticent passenger will have a complaint."" The situation worsens at night. Most of the 15 bus routes operating at the station do not run after 11 pm. By that time, the two subway lines at the station also have closed. About 10 trains arrive between 11pm and midnight, leaving as many as 10,000 passengers searching for taxis. They form a zigzag line waiting for cabs in a stuffy area of the station, and sometimes the line can stretch hundreds of meters. Those at the front cannot see the end. In summer, although the air conditioners are on, poor air circulation can make the humid, hot and suffocating taxi waiting area highly oppressive. One passenger, who gave his name only as Kuai, was one of those waiting on Monday after 11 pm. As a frequent bullet train traveler to Beijing, he often arrives at the station at night and said the long lines are a frequent occurrence. ""Sometimes the line will take several turns, which leaves me waiting for more than an hour,"" he said. He has tried booking hailed cars and taxis online in advance, but without a definite pickup point drivers usually have difficulty finding him. ""When cabs enter the station's underground garage, the navigation signal is poor and drivers may easily get lost,"" he said. Cab driver Zhang Ku backed up Kuai's story, saying the maze-like garage often bewilders drivers and passengers. Given the limited choice, Kuai uses illegal cabs outside the station. ""Some taxis and illegal cabs pick up customers along the street, usually displaying 'leaving instantly' signs to attract passengers,"" he said, adding that they also overcharge. A passenger surnamed Liu said he was approached by illegal cab drivers while waiting in line. ""The most insane price was 500 yuan ($73) to Xizhimen, (about 10 times higher than the metered fare),"" Liu said. He usually takes the subway from the station, but at night when the network closes his choice is limited. The station's name, Beijing South, has been used derisively as ""Beijing difficulty"" by netizens and the media, as the word ""south"" in Chinese is pronounced the same as the word ""difficulty"". Taxi driver Zhang said he seldom goes to the station even though he has been driving for more than 20 years. ""From 11 pm to midnight, taxis are in high demand on the streets. I do not need to go to the railway station,"" he said. A cabbie surnamed Du said the streets near Beijing South are always congested because illegal taxis park in the area.,Chen Yanyan, dean of Beijing University of Technology's metropolitan transportation college, said Beijing South has failed to run a successful transportation hub for the traveling and nontraveling public. ""To prioritize passengers' needs, the subway could close later and buses could be added at night,"" she said. She suggested that public transportation services should be increased at the station to ease the shortage of taxis during peak hours, and that operating hours be extended to help late arrivals. ""The authorities can also take advantage of information technology to dispatch taxis more efficiently,"" she added. The station's design has also failed to prioritize passengers' needs, Chen said. The layout of a well-operated station should first consider passengers instead of business. The station's failure to distinguish its commercial area from the passenger areas has worsened the problem, she said. At Beijing South, the waiting area is surrounded by stores on the same floor. ""Separating the two areas has been the norm for well-run stations across the globe, including Hongqiao station in Shanghai, King's Cross in London and Grand Central in New York,"" she said. Chen also said that in these stations, public transportation, including the subway and buses, instead of taxis or private cars, is the principal choice for travelers.,Yang Tao, a member of the China Urban Traffic Planning Institute Academic Committee, said the reasons for the difficulties being experienced at Beijing South are complicated. ""The Beijing South problem is not only a simple problem of transport, but a problem of social governance, which is a comprehensive reflection of beliefs, technology and the services of participating stakeholders at all levels, including the government and operating companies. To solve this problem, we need to examine the situation and propose comprehensive solutions, rather than simply encouraging more taxis to go there,"" Yang said. He added that problems arose because the station was built in an area with a poor surrounding road network, insufficient land and with uncompleted links for passengers to transfer to buses, the subway or cabs. Yang added that early-stage planning for the station had not been ideal, failing to foresee the increased passenger flow and had failed to provide sufficient public transportation connections. He suggested the authorities invite professional consultants specializing in transportation design to carry out a comprehensive assessment of the station and nearby areas. This should include traffic load, the road network, public transportation system, transfers and connections, as well as management at all levels. A proposal for improvements should be submitted after seeking opinions from experts and the public. ""We should pay more attention to whether the number of subway trains and buses, as well as the service, is adequate. If the (right number of) subway trains and buses are in place, then we can solve the problem of supply and demand at source. At the same time, reform of online car-hailing should continue. The most important thing is to identify the crux of the problem, not just solve a single problem,"" he said. Yang said public transportation systems in developed European countries and Japan have been successful, but it is unrealistic to merely duplicate foreign examples. ""Integrated transportation hubs in Japan and Europe can operate round-the-clock and offer convenient public transport facilities to fully guarantee demand is met. Smooth connections, easy transfers and clear signs at stations can minimize the need for taxis,"" he said. Yang said small cars, including taxis and private vehicles, should generally be avoided for travelers, given China's large population, limited land and road resources. ""On the other hand, we should take full advantage of developing public transport and encourage people to use it more,"" he said.,Liu Daizong, China transport program director at the World Resources Institute, said cooperation between different departments, including the railway company, Beijing Municipal Commission of Transport and public security departments, can easily tackle the problems at Beijing South. Liu said the lack of interdepartmental coordination has resulted in an increase in illegal cabs operating outside the station and long lines for taxis inside. ""Trains are managed by China Railway Co, buses and subways are managed by the Beijing Municipal Commission of Transport, whereas the crackdown on illegal taxis is carried out by local police and the government,"" he said. Liu added that when coordination is improved, transportation authorities can extend the operating hours of the subway network or buses to cope with delays, or add special lines outside operating hours to meet the demand from late arrivals. ""When there's an adequate supply of public transportation, the illegal taxis will die,"" he said, adding that the growing number of passengers had not caused the problem. ""For administrators, information such as a train's arrival and departure times and the number of passengers expected, are readily available,"" he said, adding that plans requiring joint efforts can be made accordingly. More than 250,000 people use New York's Grand Central Terminal every day, but it operates without problems, Liu said, adding that if properly managed, train stations should handle both arriving and departing passengers efficiently. ""In developed countries, train stations also generate huge amounts of revenue. Customer spending at King's Cross in London is even higher than that in many high streets,"" he said, adding that there is no problem in commercializing stations.,To tackle the problems at Beijing South, joint efforts are clearly needed. According to the Beijing Municipal Commission of Transport, one of the subway lines at the station, Line 4, will extend its operating hours to 12:10 am from Friday. This late-night service will operate on Fridays, Sundays and during holidays. The station has installed 14 air conditioners and glass fences at taxi-waiting zones, and is allowing more hailed cars and online booking for taxis after 9 pm to cater to demand. An LED screen has been installed to display real-time information about the taxi line, including estimated waiting time, Liang Zhaoyu, a spokesman for the station, said on Monday. The station will also install fans and renovate the roof in the taxi waiting area to make passengers more comfortable. The project will be completed by the end of this month. From Sunday, passengers will be able to order buses leaving from the station at night. The transportation authority will release nighttime train arrival information through Beijing Transport Radio and the taxi dispatch center, encouraging more taxi drivers to pick up passengers late at night. It will also encourage cab companies to send more taxis to the station. Transport, public security and other departments will make joint efforts to clear the nearby area and keep illegal taxis off the streets. On hearing news of the extended subway operating times at the station, Liu, from the World Resources Institute, praised the prompt efforts made by the government. Kuai, the passenger, said, ""People coming to Beijing, China's capital, for business and travel should find it convenient to get around."" Shen, the commuter, said, ""Most outsiders get their first impression of the capital from Beijing South, which provides them with an image of the world's second-largest economy."" Yang Zekun contributed to this story."
0,"As China promotes winter sports nationwide in the leadup to the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, the nation's education authorities are looking to bring thrills and chills to campuses as part of a specialized physical education program. A campus soccer program, run by the Ministry of Education, has seen about 20,000 schools across the country offer soccer-specialized PE classes. Now, it's time for skating and skiing to expand on a similar scale with participation in winter sports a major priority for the country's sports and education authorities. Wang Dengfeng, director of the ministry's physical education, health and arts department, said a main task this year will be the expansion of a winter sports PE curriculum from the northeastern region across a wider area. ""We just want to involve as many children as possible in winter sports, starting at the entry level,"" Wang said during the annual session of the 13th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. ""Now, it's not about developing elite talent. It's about growing people's interest."" As part of a national winter sports promotion plan, the ministry - with support from the General Administration of Sport of China, the governing body - has set a target of introducing the curriculum in 2,000 schools by 2020. Meanwhile, Beijing has selected 52 primary and secondary schools to join a pilot program that offers training at commercial rinks and resorts. However, a lack of trainers and facilities - factors that hampered the promotion of soccer - will present even greater challenges, given China's short history of winter sports' participation. Despite that, the development of technology is expected to provide a solution. According to Bian Zhiliang, a CPPCC member and chairman of sports equipment manufacturer Taishan Sports in Shandong province, trials of the company's artificial ice rinks and skiing simulators have prompted positive feedback from about 100 pilot schools nationwide. Sets of equipment, called Ice and Snow Packs, were developed specifically for on-campus use with the help of a technical research team in Sweden. To keep costs low, the rinks and simulators can be disassembled, transported to different locations and then reassembled. ""The packs will become game changers once they enter the mass production phase after the trial. They will help winter sports to shake off climatic and geographic limits to reach more regions,"" Bian said. Wang stressed that the expansion will be implemented cautiously to allow adaptation to a range of different natural and economic conditions. ""It will certainly take time and we will never push it too hard. After all, participation should be triggered by the students' genuine interest, not administrative orders,"" he said. In September, with the help of the National Winter Sports Administrative Center, the ministry will issue a regulation to encourage a number of universities to build high-performance winter sports teams and develop a collegiate competition system, he added."
0,"China's top environmental watchdog has vowed to succeed in air pollution control this year by enhancing the management of diesel-powered trucks while further reducing industrial emissions. The Ministry of Ecology and Environment will continue this year to implement the 2018-20 air pollution control plan, which aims to control bulk coal consumption, poorly managed polluting enterprises and industrial boilers, and minimize the emissions of the steel industry. The ministry will also carry out a campaign on diesel truck management, Minister Li Ganjie said at the ministry's annual conference, which concluded on Saturday. Under the ministry's guidelines released early this month, the diesel truck management campaign will increase rail cargo transportation by 30 percent over 2017 levels by next year. Ships and trains will handle most of the medium－and long-distance cargo transportation by then. Most trucks will no longer leave trails of black smoke by then, and emission levels of at least 90 percent of the trucks will stand below the national standard, under the plan. The plan also vows to promote the use of trucks powered by new and clean energies in cargo transportation. Currently, diesel trucks are a major contributor to air pollution in China. According to Beijing Municipal Ecological Environment Bureau research, diesel trucks represent only about 4 percent of total internal combustion engines in Beijing, but they contribute 90 percent of the particulate matter from such engines. Emissions from internal combustion engines are to blame for 45 percent of locally generated air pollution in the capital, the bureau concluded. Beijing has set up a database that includes 140,000 non-locally registered trucks with substandard emissions that will be barred from entering the capital, Beijing Vice-Mayor Yang Bin, who oversees environmental protection, said on Wednesday on the sidelines of the annual session of the 13th Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Yang said Beijing handed out many more penalties on trucks with substandard emissions last year. Fixing urea-spraying facilities will help reduce emissions of nitric oxide, a major air pollutant from diesel exhaust, but many diesel trucks haven't fixed or operated the facilities as required, according to He Kebin, dean of Tsinghua University's School of Environment. The senior air pollution control expert said China's 20 million diesel trucks should consume a total of 1.35 million metric tons of urea a year if they spray the urea as required, but investigation indicates they only consume about 700,000 tons a year. Li, the minister, said 2018 was a year with marked progress in air pollution control. ""We have successfully delivered all the obligatory targets set for 2018 and stayed in line with the timetable outlined by the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-20),"" Li said. According to the ministry, 338 major Chinese cities saw about 79 percent of days with fairly good air quality in 2018, 1.3 percentage points higher than 2017. The density of PM2.5 particulate matter dropped by 9.3 percent and reached 39 micrograms per cubic meter last year."

Yan and her friends make money from selling flowers, designing gardens or balcony scenes and door-to-door plants maintenance services.Zhong Yan has a master's degree from a university in the United States, but it was his interest in model trains that dictated his next move. When he returned to China, he opened an online model train shop on Taobao. Because customers appreciate his good service, his shop has earned a good reputation among enthusiasts.  Zhong not only sells model trains, but also makes model locomotive himself. He has made the 8K locomotive model according to the real locomotive displays at China Railway Museum.  It cost more than 1 million yuan ($147, 456) to build the model 8K locomotive which includes more than 600 parts.  Zhong has now opened an offline shop along Suzhou River in Shanghai, and the model 8K locomotive is selling well in both domestic and overseas markets.,Wang Lina likes watching movies.

0,"Farmers in Beijing's northwestern Yanqing district are attending occupational training classes, with support from the local government, so they'll be ready to help out during the 2022 Winter Olympics. The district's human resources bureau said the plan is to train 100,000 people by 2022, at a rate of 20,000 a year. Two types of vocational training are offered: Western-style baking and pastry-making, and ski equipment cleaning and maintenance. The training is designed to help local farmers better serve the Games and improve their job prospects as ski tourism takes off in the area. Yanqing, 74 kilometers northwest of central Beijing, will host several events in 2022, including Alpine skiing, bobsled, skeleton and luge. ""The training is being provided on the basis of what farmers in Yanqing need. And there's an urgent need for local residents to have the skills training before the events approach,"" said Xu Xi, director of Beijing's Human Resources and Social Security Bureau, which is supervising the program. Xu said the training will be conducted by two vocational schools in Beijing, and that the farmers will also receive training in language and etiquette. Yanqing farmer Guo Junhua, 34, is an avid skier and a local ski coach. Because of a lack of access to professional training, she learned to ski on a mountain near her village. In September, friends who practiced on the same slopes introduced her to the Haituo ""farmer ski team"". She joined the 18-member team－whose average age is 26－to get more professional training and help train others interested in skiing. In December, members of the team received some international-level training organized by the Swiss Ski Association. Guo said she is excited about the vocational training and wants to learn how to wax and store snowboards properly. ""I'm even more thrilled that I can use the opportunity to improve my English and enhance my chances of being a volunteer at the Winter Olympics,"" she said. Zhao Jinrong, 48, from Jingzhuang town in Yanqing, is receiving weekly training in Western-style baking and pastry-making from Beijing Industry and Technicians College. She has basic baking skills but never had the chance to learn professional techniques before. As the operator of a family farm restaurant, she said it is a precious opportunity to learn Western-style cooking skills and some basic English. ""Increasing numbers of foreigners are showing up in my restaurant,"" she said. ""To be able to say hello to them in English would really help me and my business."" The college is providing the culinary and etiquette training for the farmers. Fang Weiguo, the college president, said it had invited a chef from a famous Western restaurant chain, Maxim's de Paris, to help provide professional training. ""It's also a way to make up for the lack of volunteer resources for the 2022 Winter Olympics,"" Fang said."
1,"Thanks to the fast-growing sharing economy, fitness buffs needn't necessarily ""go to the gym."" Many can enjoy the luxury of the gyms coming to them. As the daily commute between work and home in mega-cities is already tiring, not everyone likes to travel extra miles to the gym, which restricts gymgoers' choice of places to work out. ""Don't (take the) risk to sign up for membership if the gym is not within walking distance to home or workplace because you know you will never go,"" said Dong Fang, a 26-year-old Shanghai-based real-estate manager. But a new business model inspired by the sharing economy is solving the dilemma. BULA, a yoga sharing-space platform founded by Naked Group, the Shanghai-based co-working space and high-end resort company, is bringing the workout place close to white collar workers. ""BULA is a three-sided marketplace－space owners, teachers and students,"" said Dominic Penaloza, chief innovation officer of Naked Group. Similar to Airbnb, owners offer vacant space to BULA; teachers book the space and conduct pop-up classes while students can discover classes around them, giving them easy access to the available places and variable classes close to them on a pay-as-you-go basis. BULA also gives users access to world-renowned yoga masters' classes, such as those held by Duncan Wong－once private coach of superstar Madonna, while neither teachers nor members need to worry about being bonded to a gym with a long-term contract. ""Our goal is to make fitness more accessible by enabling more convenient locations that bring teachers to students without large up-front payments,"" Penaloza said. While BULA is offering pop-up classes around the city in Shanghai, another startup is bringing gyms to people's doorstep in Beijing. Beijing-based Misspao Technology Co Ltd has built compact gym booths inside residential complexes within five minutes' walking distance for the residents. The booth occupies only four square meters, making it easier and cheaper to build than traditional gyms. It can host one or two users at a time, equipped with a treadmill and a spinning bike that charges 0.2 yuan (3 cents) per minute instead of membership, similar to the sharing bikes. ""According to the research we conducted in Beijing, 10 percent of city workers have signed up for gym membership but only a few keep going there,"" said Bi Zhen, founder of Misspao. ""Exercise has not become a habit because of the restriction of locations and equipment."" Qian Kun, general manager of Matrix Partners China, one of the investors of Misspao, said the advantage of Misspao is that it can provide fitness solutions with easy access to workout facilities in good condition. ""It has the potential to become a common facility of residential areas in the future,"" he said. With a market value of 100 million yuan, the four-month-old startup has already sourced 75 million yuan investment."

It borders Argentina to its west and Brazil to its north and east. ""Most Chinese people are familiar with Uruguay soccer players, and soccer is indeed the most popular sport in Uruguay. However, our country has more to offer,"" said Agustina. According to her, Uruguay has cooperated with China's Ministry of Culture and Education this year. Both sides agreed to build a Chinese cultural center in Uruguay and set up a learning center at Beijing Jiaotong University to spread Uruguay culture. Also, the first Confucius Institute has been unveiled to the locals in Uruguay.,Ignacio Perez Gomar, a young artist from Uruguay, was a highlight of the expo. As an art talent, he began turning sand into art works since he was a child. ""It is the first time I have been to China. I think this is a beautiful country and I enjoyed the experience,"" he said, adding that ""Through my art work, I want to show the loving and passionate inner world to all the people."" Agustina said that many of Gomar's artworks can give a boost to people-to-people exchanges between China and Uruguay, and also make Uruguay cultural accessible more to Chinese people.,During his stay to China, he has offered a visual feast to people in Beijing, Tianjin and Bengbu. It is worth noting that Nanjing-based Anben Studio will hold an opening ceremony for his work in January. The year 2018 marks the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and Uruguay. Uruguay was the first country in the Latin American region to sign a cooperation agreement with China on the Belt and Road Initiative."
1,"China will give greater emphasis to opening-up based on rules and institutions, in a bid to pursue high-quality growth and assure an international competitive edge to its business environment, said Vice-Minister of Commerce Qian Keming. The approval of the Foreign Investment Law is a recent example of China's commitment to promoting institutional opening-up, and experts hoped detailed regulations will come out soon. At the ongoing China Development Forum 2019 in Beijing, Qian said the country will improve the opening-up process based on the ""flow of goods and factors of production"", and give greater emphasis to opening-up based on rules and related institutions. Institutional opening-up means opening up in a more systematic way, Qian said during a panel discussion on Sunday. ""In the past, we crossed the river by feeling the stones,"" he said, citing Chinese leaders' description of the start of the reform and opening-up process 40 years ago. ""Now, we will focus more on top-level design led by new development of models, ideas and strategies."" Qian said the country will put more emphasis on improving its rules, institutions and laws, while striving to open up its economy on all fronts. To achieve the goal, a key undertaking is to continue building a world-class business environment and level the playing field for all market entities, he said. China approved the Foreign Investment Law this month to better protect foreign investors' rights. Under the law, China will treat foreign and Chinese enterprises equally. The law bars forced technology transfers and stipulates strict protection of the intellectual property of foreign-invested enterprises. It stipulates that foreign businesses will receive standard national treatment in setting up businesses, subject to a negative list system that regulates market access. Qian said the country will clean up any existing laws and regulations that go against the national standard, adjust local governments' regulations and expedite detailed regulations. The Ministry of Commerce has been working with several departments to formulate supporting regulations, according to spokesman Gao Feng. Craig Allen, president of the US-China Business Council, said he hoped for detailed regulations to ensure the smooth implementation of the law, which will take effect on Jan 1. He said the enactment of the law is going in the ""right direction"", but a lot of work needs to be done to fill out the law. ""We think the general philosophy of the law is very positive, and we are anxious to work with the Chinese government on the detailed implementation regulations,"" Allen told China Daily on the sidelines of the forum. Allen also said he hoped for detailed implementation regulations that will respond to the concerns of foreign companies in specific ways. The Chinese government has made ""real progress"" in intellectual property rights protection, he said, adding that he hoped to see further development. ""Copyright, trademark and trade secret protections are critical to an innovative society, and I think the Foreign Investment Law tries to address that,"" he said."

0,"A big data report jointly released by Ctrip, a Shanghai-based online travel agency, and Skyscanner, a leading global travel search site, reveals three features and trends of the recently-concluded Spring Festival holiday: Beijing tops the hotlist of places of departure; Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou are still the most popular destinations for inbound travelers, and the Spring Festival travel rush shows a hint of reversed direction. Due to the growing middle-class, the outbound tourism market is still vibrant. Traveling abroad has become a top option for Chinese people in developed citities like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Chengdu, with Beijing ranking at the top spot as the place of departure. It suggests that Chinese people in affluent areas have broken from tradition to some extent and are prone to new ways of celebrating Spring Festival. Instead of the traditional going back home for family reunion, they choose to take their family on a vacation abroad. In terms of destinations, places near the Chinese mainland are the most popular. Thailand remains the most popular overseas destination on the list during this period, followed by Japan. What highlights this year's niche travel market is the Philippines; its city, Cebu, enjoyed a 145% increase in the number of tourist arrivals, which ranks at first place on the dark horse destination list.,As more and more Chinese tourists opt for a foreign vacation during the holiday, another noteworthy trend is that a considerable number of foreign expats come to China to experience the Chinese Lunar New Year. Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou are still the top three destinations for foreign visitors, as big cities can offer a vibrant urban life experience and convenient transportation. But second-tier cities like Chengdu, Xiamen, Chongqing, Wuhan, Fuzhou, Changsha and Kunming also make the list due to their folk culture, unique cuisine and pleasant climate. For Chinese people, the most important Spring Festival tradition is going back to their hometown for family reunion. So usually the Spring Festival travel rush unleashes China's largest seasonal migration of people. But according to data, this year's travel rush shows a reversed direction, that is, a growing percentage of people chose to pick up the elderly and other family members to join them in cities to celebrate Spring Festival. Five popular destinations for this reversed travel route are Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Hangzhou. The rationale behind this trend is that people can avoid the transportation peak by choosing a reversed direction."
1,"BEIJING - With its own development and becoming increasingly closer to the center of the world stage, China has been injecting positive energy into the international community in pursuit of better global governance over recent years. At the 86th Interpol General Assembly held in Beijing last week, China proposed a concept of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security to jointly respond to security challenges. At the BRICS' Xiamen Summit in early September, China put forward the ""BRICS Plus"" approach by inviting the leaders of Egypt, Mexico, Thailand, Tajikistan and Guinea to take part in a dialogue. BRICS began its second golden decade with the summit to make the grouping ever brighter. As the world's second largest economy and the biggest contributor of global economic growth, China's innovative concepts on improving global governance and promoting global peace and common prosperity have gained wide recognition and support from other countries. Undergoing structural reforms, China is implementing its new concept of innovative, coordinated, green, open and shared development, eyeing a quality growth model driven by innovation. Meanwhile, the country is assuming its international responsibility to promote common development with other countries in the interconnected world. The Belt and Road Initiative, building a community of shared future for mankind and the principle of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, all proposed by China, have been incorporated in U.N. resolutions, showing wide international consensus on the concepts. Equality, mutual respect and win-win cooperation feature in the Chinese plans, which also safeguard the irreversible trend of globalization. After colonialism, imperialism and hegemonism, the world is ushering in an era of ""win-winism"" as initiated by China, a country which unswervingly adheres to its peaceful development path, according to Hu Angang, director of the center for China studies at Tsinghua University in Beijing. ""Win-winism"" highlights an open world economy for common development of all countries and joint efforts to address global challenges such as climate change and terrorism, and exchanges of different cultures, said the researcher. China has been actively assuming its international responsibility and participating in global governance by putting forward new concepts, thoughts and plans to reshape the global governance system, said Liu Wei, president of Renmin University of China, at a global governance forum on Saturday in Beijing. For example, the Silk Road spirit of peace and cooperation, openness and inclusiveness, mutual learning and mutual benefit has injected new momentum into global governance, said Liu. The world needs a new type of globalization, which calls for improving global governance and boosting common development, former Egyptian Prime Minister Essam Sharaf said at the forum. The Belt and Road Initiative, which is multilateral and open, is a global project and a response to global demands, he added."
1,"More and more Chinese tourists are completing their visa applications using mobile terminals, and going outdoors to take visa photos has become history among the new generation of Chinese outbound tourists, said a market insider.  Each year, as many as 1 million people have used the online visa application service offered by Ctrip, China's largest online travel platform, since its launch in July 2015, according to Huang Qing, head of Ctrip's visa business division.  Through its online service, customers can fill in application forms online, submit ID photos, hand in scanned versions of their marriage certificate, ID card, passport and confirm all the materials are correct and accurate before they are submitted.  ""This has saved a lot of communication time for our clients. Before, only half of the application materials were valid during their first submission, and it took two or three times on average for offline visa applications,"" Huang said.  The online visa service is a blessing for internet-savvy tourists, who are tired of the complex and outdated offline process.  According to Huang, Ctrip decided to make a foray into online visa applications after a two-month survey among its customers in early 2015.  To date, the online travel platform can help tourists apply for visas in 84 countries' embassies and consulates in China, and it also offers visa application reservations to 125 nations and regions.  The internet process also shortens the time needed to complete the application as well as reducing expenses on transportation and paper printing.  ""More than 60 percent of Ctrip's online tourism customers applied for their visas on smartphones, and 75 percent of their visa photos are selfies,"" Huang said.    Becoming a new force in overseas traveling, Chinese tourists have to spend a lot of time and energy on visa material preparations according to the different requirements of destinations.  ""After two years' of preparation, Alitrip, the travel unit of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, announced the launch of its online visa center service on Oct 28,"" said Zhou Zheng, vice-president of Alitrip.  ""We offer online services such as optical character recognition, online visa photographs, process tracking and material pickup,"" Zhou said.  As many as 28 million outbound trips were made through Alitrip's platforms throughout 2016.  According to Zhou, Alitrip's goal is to have material submissions, visa application, as well as embassy audits all available online.  To attract Chinese tourists, many embassies and consulates are looking to simplify the visa application process and audition procedures with the support of technology companies, which can also attract customers by enhancing the overall service, Yang Yanfeng, a researcher from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, was quoted as saying by Beijing News.  ""Electronic visas are becoming popular. In some circumstances, a smartphone can apply for and receive the visa in seconds,"" said Huang.  With the resources of Alibaba Group, Alitrip will be able to automatically fill in the basic information of its customers according to his or her history, and even provide financial records and documents to ease the material collecting process from a couple of days to half an hour in the future, Zhou said.  Online visa application services offered by travel platforms are aimed at the large outbound traveling market from China. As many as 122 million trips were made to overseas destinations throughout 2016, spending a total of $109.8 billion, an annual report on Chinese overseas tourism by China Tourism Academy showed.  From January to June, 62 million trips were made to destinations outside China, up 5.4 percent year-on-year, and the whole year growth rate is expected to reach 6 percent, Xu Yi, an analyst from Guolian Securities, wrote.  Xu expected the Chinese outbound tourism market to maintain robust growth as less than 10 percent of the Chinese population holds a passport.  A modern visa service is regarded as an important step to win customers; in addition, the data collected through the service will enable platforms to come up with more tailor-made products for target customers, said analysts."
1,"China and the United States achieved positive and concrete progress in the fields of agriculture and energy during the latest round of trade consultations, with the details subject to finalization by both sides, according to a Chinese statement issued on Sunday. While acknowledging the positive development, the statement emphasized that the results achieved between China and the US should be based on the condition that the two sides meet each other halfway and agree not to engage in a trade war. If the US introduces trade sanctions, including tariff increases, all the economic and trade achievements negotiated by the two sides will not take effect, according to the statement. The statement came after Vice-Premier Liu He held talks with US Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross in Beijing on Saturday and Sunday. The talks were a continuation of the China-US trade and economic consultations in Washington two weeks ago. China reiterated in the statement that its attitude has been consistent and it is willing to increase imports from numerous countries around the world, including the US, to meet the Chinese people's growing demand for a better life and the requirements of high-quality economic development. Sunday's statement also emphasized that reform and opening-up as well as boosting domestic demand are China's national strategies and the established pace (of implementing the strategies) will not change. Experts viewed the statement as a reflection of China's desire to resolve the trade disputes and to respond to external challenges by firmly upholding its reform and opening-up policies. ""China is pursuing long-term goals and is trying to focus on upgrading its economy and meeting the growing demand of domestic consumers while the US is seeking short-term gains. Judging from the talk results, the country (China) has ensured its core interests,"" said Mei Xinyu, a researcher at the International Trade and Economic Cooperation Institute, part of the Ministry of Commerce. Mei pointed out that greater energy imports, such as crude oil and natural gas, from the US at reasonable prices could help China reduce its manufacturing cost and boost the sector's strength in the world market. ""China had already planned to import the goods it agreed to purchase from the US a long time ago. Therefore, it will not be an issue if China imports more US energy and agricultural products,"" he said. Dong Yan, director of the International Trade Office at the Institute of World Economics and Politics of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that China's reform and opening-up have been a consistent policy, which cannot be hindered by external pressure of trade conflicts. Dong warned that a trade war will not only hurt China and the US, but it will also become a drag on the global economy. ""The firm stance on opening the market wider is China's response to the challenges facing the global economy. It illustrates the country's inclusiveness to share opportunities with the rest of the world and to fulfill its responsibilities,"" she said. Zhang Yansheng, a researcher at the China Center for International Economic Exchanges, said boosting imports will be an important policy of China for the next step as it will increase the interconnection the country has with the world."
0,"Preparation for 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic Games was on top of President Xi Jinping's Spring Festival agenda. Xi, who has emphasized the significance of hosting successful games on several occasions, has visited many cities to ensure that the Beijing games are a success. Let's follow his footprints as we travel down China's Winter Olympics road.   President Xi was invited by his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to attend the 22nd Winter Olympic Games in Sochi. He visited Chinese athletes and cheered for them. Xi said he is a huge sports fan and loves nearly all kinds of games.  ""Sports do us good physically and mentally,"" he said. ""We have successfully hosted the Beijing (Summer) Olympic Games, fulfilling our hundred-year Olympic dreams. Now, we are closer than any time to the goal of realizing Chinese nation's great rejuvenation."" Xi added that every individual's dream, the dream of becoming a sports power, are closely connected with the Chinese Dream. He hoped the Chinese delegation would display its fighting spirit and achieve good results in Sochi. Chinese Olympic Committee officially announced its bid for the 24th Winter Olympic Games three months before Xi's visit.,President Xi visited the International Olympic Committee (IOC) headquarters in Lausanne and met with IOC President Thomas Bach during his Swiss visit in January, 17 months after Beijing won the bid to host 2022 Winter Olympics.  ""China will keep its promise and take resolute steps to host a great Winter Olympics. And we will finish all the prep work sooner rather than later. I will visit Zhangjiakou (cohost city of 2022 Games) as soon as I get back to China and see the ski resort there,"" Xi told Bach. Bach believed that Beijing will deliver an amazing game under Xi's strong leadership.,The Zhangjiakou site of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games in Chongli District is known as the best natural ski area in North China, and Xi was briefed about the ongoing work there on Jan 23, 2017.  Xi stressed that the general plan for the games should be prioritized. The president said Zhangjiakou's plans should be integrated into the wider plans for the games. ""The construction of sports facilities must be professional, and supporting facilities should embody the characteristics of China and the local areas,"" Xi said. Xi also visited national ski-team athletes, and was briefed about the training and competitions of the athletes. Winter sports are full of passion as they are hard, demanding, and fun to watch, said the president.  Xi noted that ice and snow sports lack popularity and competitiveness in China, and the country is set to fill this shortcoming by hosting the Winter Olympics. The president said he has lots of hope in the youngsters and encourages the country to leap forward in the next five years.  President Xi Jinping visited Beijing Wukesong Sports Center and the Capital Gymnasium on Feb 24, 2017. At Wukesong Sports Center, venue for the 2022 Winter Olympics ice hockey event, Xi remembered his first time on the ice in skating boots when he saw a group of young ice hockey players.Hesaid the kids nowadays are ""very fortunate"" as they enjoyed high-standard facilities.  Xi also visited national team athletes at the Capital Gymnasium, venue for short-track speed skating and figure skating. When he met with Wu Dajing, winner of the 500m short-track speed skating in the recently held Asian Winter Games in Sapporo, Xi said he watched the finals and cheered for Wu.  The president encouraged athletes to secure their advantages in ice-sports and catch up in snow-sports as the latter remains a weakness of the country. Xi also reminded the athletes to strike a balance between training and study, alternate training and rest, and train safely.  Youths sports and winter sports are the two priorities of Chinese sports development, the president stressed.  President Xi Jinping presided over a symposium on preparation for the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games in Beijing on Feb 24, 2017. After listening to the report delivered by Gou Zhongwen, director of the General Administration of Sport, Xi said the Beijing Winter Olympics is an important and signature event that requires intensive preparation work.  The year 2021 marks the 100th Anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party, and the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics will be an important opportunity to inspire national spirit and consolidate Chinese people home and abroad. To improve the standard of Chinese winter sports requires planning in advance and continuous promotion, added the president.  ""In the long term, we should expand the winter sports coverage and lay a solid foundation among publics; and in the short term, we must improve our competitiveness and make breakthroughs as soon as possible,"" said Xi. With five years to go before the opening of Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, China endeavors to scale new heights in ice-snow sports competitiveness and public penetration under promotion of various departments, he added."
1,"The International Monetary Fund maintained its China economic growth forecasts while trimming global growth projections for 2019 at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Monday. China's economic growth is projected to be 6.2 percent for 2019, the same as the IMF's previous prediction in October. Domestic demand is also estimated to remain robust, aided by policies to boost consumption this year, the IMF said in its Global Economic Prospects. Figures show growth in China remains robust, in part reflecting resilient consumption. However industrial production and new export orders have moderated, asset prices have experienced downward pressure and sovereign bond spreads have risen amid trade tensions. Prices of newly constructed residential buildings have rebounded, including in first-tier cities following a period of correction according to the report. The Fund projects a 3.5 percent growth rate worldwide for 2019 and 3.6 percent for 2020, down 0.2 and 0.1 percentage points compared to its forecasts in October, said IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath at an Update of the World Economic Outlook press conference. The world economy is growing more slowly than expected, risks are rising and the expansion seen in recent years is losing momentum, said IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde at the forum, calling for policymakers to collaborate to address global risks.,The reason for the gloomy forecast is the US-triggered trade tension between China and the US, which could dampen confidence in investment and economic development, said Wang Huiyao. Wang is a counselor of the State Council, China's Cabinet, and founder and president of the Center for China and Globalization, the Beijing-headquartered non-governmental think tank. China is one of the world's largest economic engines and the leader of the global value chain, so if the tension hurts both countries' economies it would definitely harm world economic forecasts, Wang said. China should continue its reform and opening-up and continue to support the world economy, Wang added.,China's support for the World Trade Organization and free trade is a counterbalance to the loss of momentum for the world economy, said Daryl Guppy, international financial technical analysis expert and special consultant to Axicorp. The IMF forecast does not adequately assess the contribution of the Belt and Road Initiative to economic growth - not just in developed economies, but in emerging economies as well. In 2008 the world relied on China to lead the way and 2019 will be no different, Guppy said. China's year-on-year GDP growth reached 6.6 percent in 2018, achieving its goal of around 6.5 percent GDP growth set for the year, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Monday. With the magnitude and size of the GDP at present, this kind of rate is already very impressive, so it is extremely important for China to maintain its above six percent GDP growth with continuous reform and opening-up and trade with more countries at a fast pace, Wang said."
1,"Foreign headhunting companies see opportunity and innovation in newly announced policies in Beijing's recruitment market and say they expect the whole industry will benefit. Foreign talent agencies can now own up to 70 percent of a joint venture registered in the Chinese capital, up from 49 percent, Chen Bei, a spokeswoman for the city's Human Resources and Social Security Bureau, said on Tuesday. Also, a requirement has been removed that foreign investors have at least three years of experience in the recruitment industry overseas before entering the Beijing market. ""This is the most open policy in China's headhunting market and will bring benefits to both foreign investors and Chinese companies that are short on senior talent,"" Chen said. Simon Lance, managing director for China at Hays Specialist Recruitment, a UK-listed multinational company, called it a positive move that will drive innovation and boost more cooperation between Chinese and foreign headhunting companies. ""The policy will cause more competition of course because it encourages more investors to come to Beijing,... but it will drive innovation, which is good for any business,"" Lance said. More foreign investors will seek Chinese partners for joint ventures in the business, which is helpful in the transfer of knowledge and expertise between the two sides, he said. China opened its recruitment market around 2000. Since then, foreign headhunting companies started to enter the market through joint ventures with Chinese partners. Beijing's new policy is among efforts to attract more overseas talent to the city. Lance said it will take a year or two to see the positive effect in terms of landing foreign talent. Wei Ran, director of Shanghai procurement and supply chain at Michael Page, a British recruitment firm, said China has become its second-largest human resources market and it is expanding its services to more local companies and opening new offices as it faces increasing competition. ""China is a candidate-driven market,"" she said. ""Opportunities are there."" She said the increased share that foreign investors can own in joint ventures can help companies better organize their personnel and grow profit. Xu Ye, consultant director of Dynamic Resources Asia, a recruitment firm based in Vancouver, Canada, said the company may establish a Beijing office because of the new policy. ""The new policy may not represent much of a threat to current players, whether foreign or domestic, given that the industry underwent a shakeout during the financial crisis. The ones that survived have their own strengths,"" she said."
1,"Rashmi Sharma, 46, CEO of one of Zambia's largest jewel companies, worried about carrying a 10-carat emerald, valued at around $100,000, from Lusaka, Zambia's capital, to Shanghai for the first Chinese International Import Expo. No insurance company in China was willing to offer coverage for any form of transporting the gem. By the third day of her exhibit, however, her thoughts were focused on the overwhelming crowd of visitors and purchasers filling her less than 5-square-meter booth all day. ""I am offered a variety of business opportunities now. There are people trying to become our mining partners back in Zambia and help us improve the production, and those offering to become our franchise partners in China. I am also starting to think about opening a retail shop on our own,"" said Sharma, a fellow of the Gemological Association of Great Britain and a member of the Gemological Institute of America. According to Zambia's Ministry of Commerce, copper accounts for more than 90 percent of the country's exports to China, which amounted to about $1.33 billion last year. As a part of the efforts to diversify its trade offerings to China, the ministry brought eight companies－ranging from producers of honey to arts and crafts, and a jeweler— to the CIIE. Zambian Commerce Minister Kayula Siame said at the expo she is confident her country's exports to China will increase in volume and value and become more varied because of the event. ""We have been sending copper to China for a very long time. This expo has been very critical to us to show what Zambia can offer beyond copper,"" Siame said. Since September's 2018 Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in Beijing, the south-central African country has already reached an agreement with China to export 3.45 metric tons of organic honey. Zambia, where some of the world's largest emeralds have been discovered in recent years, is not the only developing country trying to grab a share of China's import market, which is expected to exceed $30 trillion in goods and $10 trillion in services in the next 15 years. President Xi Jinping emphasized in his keynote speech at the expo's opening ceremony that economic globalization is an irreversible historical trend and all countries should uphold the principle of inclusive development and shared benefits in order to realize common development. The CIIE welcomed more than 30 less-developed countries, which were given not only free booths, but also logistical assistance during the event. Syrian exhibitors brought the damask rose, mentioned in Shakespeare's Sonnet 130 and known for its therapeutic properties; Ethiopia offered a variety of organic spices, which have been finding their way to international kitchens thanks to infrastructure China helped to build; and Tunisia, whose olive oil industry is believed to date to Roman times, hopes to follow Spain and Italy to persuade Chinese cooks to choose it over the traditional cooking oils. Benin's World Trade Organization Ambassador Eloi Laourou said at the CIIE that less than 3 percent of the 450,000 tons of cotton the country produced last year was processed there, reducing the profit. So Benin hopes not only to ship more cotton to China, but also bring more technology and capital from China back home."
1,"Integrated overall planning, clear functions for provincial and municipal governments and sufficient supportive mechanisms are key to building metropolitan areas in China, according to experts and researchers speaking at the ongoing Boao Forum for Asia. China's regional development has entered into the era of metropolitan areas, and this assessment has been reinforced by this year's Government Work Report. The coordinated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, the integration of the Yangtze River Delta area and the construction of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area are becoming key poles of economic growth. According to Gu Qiang, head of the Industry Research Institute under China Fortune Land Development Co Ltd, urban microcenters in China are key components of metropolitan areas and require further development in public transportation and social service facilities. The industrial project by CFLD at Gu'an city in North China's Hebei province has benefited from the industrial radiation of Beijing. The company has launched 15 new industrial projects at outskirts regions of metropolitan areas such as Beijing and Shanghai, and raised the value of outskirts cities as well. ""New financing channels and innovative financing methods such as PPP mode, asset securitization and finance leasing may contribute to the building of metropolitan areas,"" Gu said, adding the introduction of social capital in infrastructure construction, public services and building of new cities can reduce the risk of government debt and improve the urbanization of outskirts areas. ""Coordination and integration between cities remain the key words of developing metropolitan areas,"" said Zhang Yansheng, chief research fellow at the China Center for International Economic Exchanges. Shenzhen, the most innovative region in the Greater Bay Area, may join hands with Hong Kong, which boasts top universities, capital markets and a modern service industry. Zhang suggested Guangzhou, as a city of trade and service, could also coordinate with Foshan, which boasts a high-quality traditional manufacturing industry. Xu Xianping, professor of the Guanghua School of Management at Peking University, said the government has done a great job integrating infrastructure facilities. ""From high-speed rail to railways, we've seen tremendous improvements every year,"" Xu said, stressing the equalization of public services remains another key component in pushing forward the integration of metropolitan areas. Li Xunlei, chief economist and head of the Research Institute at Zhongtai Securities, said the free flow of people could break regional barriers and restrictions of administrative mechanisms, adding regional economic development strategies should be adjusted to promote the development of metropolitan areas. Jia Kang, chief economist at the Chinese Academy of Fiscal Sciences, suggested cities develop their own features to trigger their potential. ""For example, Beijing should reinforce its advantages in culture and scientific innovation, while Shanghai should fully use of its economic and shipping advantages,"" he added."
1,"The United States' violation of World Trade Organization principles could endanger multilateralism, while China has been firmly obeying WTO rules to safeguard the global trade system, experts said. Concerns have arisen over escalating trade conflicts between the two sides, which would lead to a situation where normal trade disputes are solved by unilateral action rather than multilateral procedures, they said. US tariff measures under Section 301 of US Trade Act of 1974 have violated the rules and principles of the WTO in three respects, said Xiao Jin, a partner at King & Wood Mallesons, a Beijing-headquartered multinational law firm. ""First, it is a violation of the principle of most favored nation status, as the US announced additional tariffs targeting only China but not any other countries,"" he said. Most favored nation status is essentially a method of establishing equality of trading opportunity among states by making originally bilateral agreements multilateral. ""Second, the announced 25 percent tariffs on Chinese imports exceed the maximum rates the US has committed to under the WTO,"" Xiao said. ""Third, under the exclusive jurisdiction of the WTO dispute settlement system, any attempt to seek redress must be made in the institutional framework of the WTO only."" Xiao said the US has been vetoing the appointment of new members to the WTO's Appellate Body since last year, which will destroy the dispute settlement mechanism in the near future and damage the multilateral dispute settlement mechanism. Zhang Xiangchen, China's ambassador to the WTO, agreed. He said in a written statement that the US has ""gravely undermined the foundation of the WTO and put the WTO in unprecedented danger"". In stark contrast, China has been firmly defending the multilateral system and seeking redress via WTO procedures to solve trade disputes. Shortly after the unilateral moves by the US, China filed requests for consultation under the WTO dispute settlement framework over the US tariff proposals against China under the Section 301 investigation and Section 232 of the US Trade Expansion Act of 1962. ""As the US refused to negotiate in accordance with WTO rules, China has to initiate the dispute settlement procedure to defend its rights and interests,"" China's Ministry of Commerce said in an online statement. There have been 137 cases against the US at the WTO, accounting for around a quarter of the total cases handled by the organization, according to the statistics offered by Xiao. The data showed that, of the 80 cases for which the WTO has issued rulings, the US lost 69 of them, being held to have violated WTO rules. This number is far more than that of China. US pursuit of ""fair trade"", which underlines ""absolute fairness"", is parochial, said Dong Yan, director of the International Trade Office at Institute of World Economics and Politics of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. ""It not only asks for the same competitive environment as other countries for US producers, but also requires other economies to impose the same level of tariffs and achieve the same level of opening-up as the US."""
1,"China is the largest building construction market in the world, with up to 2 billion square meters constructed annually, which will account for nearly half of new construction globally in the coming decade. In 2011, buildings accounted for just 28 percent of China's energy consumption, but urbanization, economic growth and rising population could increase this number by as much as 40 percent over the next 15 years. The adoption of green building technologies and solutions is a key enabler to support China's sustainability and environmental protection goals. China's 13th Five-Year Plan for Building Energy Efficiency and Green Building Development includes aggressive goals for green building construction and renovation, including a requirement for 50 percent of all new urban buildings to be certified green buildings. The plan also specifies pilot programs for constructing and renovating energy-efficient primary and secondary schools, community hospitals and public buildings. As the national five-year plan is cascaded to provincial and municipal jurisdictions, nearly 20 cities have set even more ambitious targets. For example, Changde, Zhenjiang, Zibo, Wuxi, Suzhou, Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen and Chongqing will require 100 percent of new commercial buildings to be green. In the pursuit of even more sustainability, more than 90 percent of China commercial-building owners plan to have at least one net or near-zero energy building in the next 10 years. National plans, policies and targets are important drivers of investment and improvement. Still, significant challenges remain in implementation at a city and district level, such as capacity-building, business models, financial solutions and access to information. Public-private partnerships continue to be one of the most effective ways of overcoming these barriers. The East Asia launch of the Building Efficiency Accelerator (BEA), a global public-private partnership coordinated by the World Resources Institute, was held at the Thirteenth International Conference on Green and Energy-Efficient Building in Beijing. The launch included government, private-sector and civil society stakeholders and showcased the building-efficiency policy best practices of three leading Chinese districts – Changning district, Wuxi City High-Tech Industrial Development Zone, and Suzhou Taihu New City, as well as the BEA partner cities of Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, and Iskandar, Malaysia. The Changning district deployed an energy-monitoring platform that now tracks 160 of the district's 165 public buildings. To date, 32 buildings have been retrofitted to achieve an average 20 percent energy savings. The district also provided subsidies to building managers, which in turn encouraged building managers to invest an additional 140 million yuan ($20.33 million) to improve building efficiency. Wuxi City High-Tech Industrial Development Zone provided incentives for new buildings that are certified to the US Green Building Council's LEED or China's national three-star rating systems. Buildings that achieve the highest green building ratings in either certification program receive up to 500,000 yuan ($75,000) with similar incentives provided for the use of heat pumps, solar photovoltaic systems, and other clean energy technologies.  The Suzhou Taihu New City will house 200,000 residents, and all buildings will be designed to receive at least two stars from China's three-star rating system. The city will also boast a green-building demonstration area, constructing several projects such as zero-energy schools and monitoring of the building's energy performance. The progress of these districts is substantial, but there's still a long way to go. Throughout my 20-plus-year career at Johnson Controls, we've been innovating technologies and solutions to make buildings smarter, safer and greener. We see it not only as a value proposition, but more importantly, as a responsibility to help cities and communities become more efficient and sustainable. Our new Asia-Pacific headquarters will not only be a showcase for smart, sustainable building technologies and solutions, but also a living laboratory supporting our work within the US-China CERC Building Energy Efficiency consortium. We will leverage the facility to convene roundtables and forums to support these public-private partnerships and share industry best practices that can help local and provincial governments in China and across the Asia-Pacific improve sustainability and accelerate urban-efficiency improvements."

0,"The growth of takeout food deliveries provides customer convenience, but also poses an eco-threat, as Zheng Jinran reports.  On workdays, Ma Rong, a 25-year-old white-collar worker in Beijing, usually orders takeout at lunchtime, especially on hot summer days, to avoid crowded restaurants and save time.  ""We don't have a canteen or time to cook when working, so we have to rely on takeout,"" she said.  Easy access to the internet and efficient delivery mean a growing number of people are taking advantage of takeout services. While these services bring convenience, the nonbiodegradable plastic bags and boxes used to wrap and deliver the food are damaging the environment, while mass provision of single-use wooden chopsticks is depleting natural resources.  Data released in August by the China Internet Network Information Center show that between January and July, 295 million people in China ordered takeout via the internet. In December 2015, the number was 114 million.  As a result, the takeout sector has seen explosive growth, with the number of domestic users rising by 2.6 times in just 18 months, according to the center, the national organization for online businesses.  Moreover, the surge is set to continue, according to Jiang Junxian, head of the China Cuisine Association. Speaking at the opening ceremony of the first forum on takeout services on July 1, Jiang told the audience that 345 million people are expected to order takeout in 2018.  In addition, people are also likely to place orders more frequently. According to data compiled by ele.me, a leading supplier of takeout food, 66 percent of those who used the company's services last year will place one order a week this year.  However, what's good for business isn't always good for the environment, and public concern is growing.  ""On average every order includes at least four plastic bags and boxes to pack the food, plus a set of disposable chopsticks, spoons and napkins,"" Ma said, adding that the materials inevitably end up in the trash can.  ""I know that plastic contaminates the environment but there's no alternative because restaurants don't use biodegradable bags.""  Models devised by the Green Volunteer League, an environmental NGO in Chongqing, present an alarming picture of consumption and pollution in the sector.  On Aug 20, the NGO wrote an open letter to major meal delivery platforms stating that its calculations show that if every takeout included 1.5 pairs of chopsticks (the average number used) and a major platform received 13 million orders in a day, more than 1.95 million pairs of chopsticks would be required to meet demand.  That scenario would see more than 6,700 trees being felled, resulting in the destruction of forest ecosystems and eco-degradation, the NGO said.  Xue Yue, an expert in plastic pollution at the China National Resources Recycling Association in Beijing, said most of the plastic packaging ends up in landfills or incinerators.  ""Most of this packaging is nonbiodegradable, so it can plague the environment for decades or even hundreds of years,"" he said. ""The low cost of nonbiodegradable plastic is the main reason it is so dominant in the market.""  He added that the low recycling rate for plastic packing is exacerbating the situation.  On Sept 1, No 4 Intermediate People's Court in Beijing accepted a lawsuit filed against three delivery platforms by the Green Volunteer League.  The league claims that the disposable packaging used by the platforms, including ele.me and a rival called Meituan, poses a high risk of environmental contamination and ecological damage. Moreover, it criticized platforms for not providing customers with a choice of alternative packaging materials.  Wang Mingyuan, a professor of environmental law at Tsinghua University, spoke out in favor of the lawsuit: ""I think it indicates growing awareness of pollution caused by takeout food companies, and could make them amend their practices.""  However, he pointed out that litigants rarely win public interest cases because the complexity of such suits means it is difficult to ascribe legal responsibility.  ""It's much better to directly contact government departments, which can work with these companies to make improvements,"" he added.  Many delivery businesses now accept that the sector is damaging the environment, and are adopting measures to combat the problem.  On June 29, the China Environmental Protection Foundation, a green NGO, the China Cuisine Associat ion, Meituan and about 100 food producers announced the formation of an organization to promote environmentally friendly takeout services.  ""Among our 10 initiatives, we are calling for widespread use of eco-friendly packaging for takeout,"" said Bai Xiangdong, the foundation's director of business development.  ""We recognize the risk of pollution and understand that delivery platforms are responsible for controlling it. That means it is necessary for us to take measures such as setting up our organization.""  On Aug 31, the day before the court accepted the lawsuit, Meituan pledged to upgrade its takeout app to provide customers with the option of ordering food in nonplastic packaging and without chopsticks, spoons or napkins.  Meanwhile, on Sept 6, ele.me published a plan to offer a similar service and promote incentives to encourage customers to embrace the change.  The company's statement said more measures will be adopted, including forming a new industry association - comprising companies, NGOs and experts - which will focus on environmental protection and call for national environmental standards on packaging in the sector.  According to Bai, from the China Environmental Protection Foundation, most packaging used for takeout food is dumped in trash cans, which means it is processed with other household garbage. He urged greater sorting of waste materials as an environmental protection measure which could reduce the volume of packaging, chopsticks and napkins in landfills, and also reduce emissions of pollutants from incinerators.      ""It would reduce takeout pollution, but the work would have to be done by local governments to ensure it is done properly,"" he said.  In March, Renmin University of China published a report on a garbage-sorting project in Beijing whose use indicated improved energy conservation and lower economic costs.  Song Guojun, a professor of environmental studies at Renmin who led the survey group, calculated that if the project had been in use in 2015 the cost of incineration services in the capital would have fallen by 64 percent, from 4.22 billion yuan ($638 million) to 1.53 billion.  Along with NGOs and large companies, a growing number of individuals are working to raise awareness of environmental protection.  Since 2011, Guo Liang, a physics teacher at a middle high school in Feixiang county, Hebei province, has guided a group of students who make models from waste packaging.  The students found the raw materials in the street, which raised their awareness of pollution and made them think twice about using disposable chopsticks, according to Guo.  He quoted the students' summary of the project: ""As individuals, we cannot really make a huge difference in the consumption of plastic, but we should always strive to make changes, no matter how trivial.""

0,"Unfavorable meteorological conditions for the dispersal of air pollutants and pollutants transported from other region by wind are to blame for the ongoing air pollution in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, authorities said. While cold air from the north will help clear the pollution on Tuesday, moderate and short-term heavy pollution may linger in cities in southern part of the region on the day, said a national joint research center on air pollution causes and control. From Friday night, the density of PM 2.5, a major air pollutant, in some cities around the Taihang and Yanshan mountains in the region began to accumulate because of pollutants transported from southwest and unfavorable conditions for pollutant dispersal, including high humidity and stable atmosphere. The hourly average concentration of PM 2.5 in Xingtai and Tangshan in Hebei province and Beijing reached heavy pollution level successively. As of 8 pm Sunday, Tangshan saw the highest daily average PM 2.5 density of 106 microgram per cubic meter on Saturday. Baoding saw the highest hourly average concentration of 164 mg/cu m at 1 am on Sunday, said the center. ""It has been regular that Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region is hit by air pollution after the National Day holiday,"" said the center in an online statement, adding the pollution this year came much later than previous years."
1,"Beijing's top Party official said the city will help people affected by a sweeping safety campaign in the wake of a deadly fire with jobs and lodging. The fire in the city's Daxing district broke out in a building with over 400 residents in the village of Xinjian in Xihongmen township on Nov 18. Nineteen people were killed and eight injured. After the fire, the city government launched a 40-day citywide campaign aimed primarily at eliminating fire hazards and other safety problems in crowded apartments and warehouses that serve as storage areas, workshops or worker living space. Cai Qi, Party chief of Beijing, said in a Monday meeting that removing all fire hazards takes time and cannot be accomplished within a short period, Beijing Daily reported. He also said it is necessary to draft a three-year plan to fundamentally solve the problem. Cai visited the site of the accident three times in recent days, Beijing Daily said. Calling the accident a ""lesson paid with blood"", he said it is imperative to carry out a campaign to root out safety hazards. He also visited surrounding companies that were affected, asking them about how workers were resettled. While speaking with local officials in Xihongmen, Cai urged them to care for people affected and try their best to arrange new jobs and places to stay. Cai urged officials to carry out the campaign with more ""patience and humanistic care"" and ""better methods"". On Monday, a job fair was held in Xihongmen to offer opportunities to people who lost their jobs when their employers were told to shut down unsafe factories or warehouses. Human resources departments will organize more job fairs in Xihongmen to help workers in the area to find new jobs, he said. Also on Monday, Beijing police announced that the fire was caused by an electrical fault, ruling out arson. Twenty people suspected of having liability for the conditions that led to the fire have been detained, they said. The two-and three-story building with a basement housed workshops and living spaces and was rife with safety hazards, officials say. A person identified only by the surname Fan began building the structure in 2002. Fan began installing a refrigeration facility in the basement in March, and it was undergoing testing. The blaze was traced to a faulty wire in a wall built with flammable material. Fan was among those detained, police said. At Monday's fair, over 508 vacancies including driver, guard and cleaner were offered by 27 companies, the township government said. Many warehouses in Xihongmen failed fire and safety assessments and were closed. The fairs are mainly for those who became unemployed as a result, said Chen Yongqiang, deputy head of the township. ""For migrant workers who have decided not to work in Beijing anymore, we will provide temporary accommodation and train or bus tickets to go home,"" Chen said. ""We prefer the employers taking part in the job fair provide accommodation for employees,"" said Li Hualong, deputy head of the Daxing district human resource and social security bureau. Zhao Chuanxin, 28, who had worked and lived in a small clothing workshop in Xinjian where the fire happened, found a job at the fair. He will start working as a driver soon with meals and accommodation provided. Contact the writers at jiangchenglong@chinadaily.com.cn"

Exotic flowers and herbs from home and abroad will be displayed during the exhibition, organizers said. ""We have selected more than 1,000 flowers from abroad, which adapt to Beijing's climate and have high ornamental value,"" said Yu Xuebin, deputy general manager of Beijing Landscape and Forestry Group. The exhibition covers an area of 503 hectares and includes themed pavilions featuring Chinese gardening culture, international plants and gardening competitions, botany and life experiences. For example, traditional flowers including wintersweets, Chinese roses and chrysanthemums will be exhibited at the China Pavilion. Chinese roses and chrysanthemums are Beijing's city flowers. They blossom in spring and autumn respectively, said Lin Qiaoling, a staff member of the pavilion. ""We have adapted the temperature control technology to ensure all of them blossom at the opening ceremony,"" she said. In addition, wildflowers will be highlighted at the exhibition. Wildflowers and plants are abundant in China, but they are rarely utilized in urban gardens, said Guo Jia, deputy director of the gardening department at the Beijing International Horticultural Exhibition Coordination Bureau. ""We have collected a large number of wildflowers and plants, and singled out 132 of them to present at the exhibition, by improving their adaptability and ornamentation with modern science and technology,"" Guo said. Organizers have also insisted on the philosophy of combining innovation and sustainability in the venue construction. Ecological protection has been consistently prioritized in venues' construction, said Zhou Jianping, standing deputy director of the bureau. The forest section of the exhibition evolved from a forest park project in Yanqing district, where there are nearly 50,000 plants. Some of them have grown for more than two decades. ""From design to construction, we have retained all of the original vegetation and made full use of it,"" Zhou said. He added that local authorities have rejuvenated the originally damaged wetlands to save its role and promote biodiversity. ""From the perspective of the horticulture industry development worldwide, Chinese people's spending on gardening is still low,"" he said, adding that most of them think of floriculture as being used in a celebration of special events, such as festivals and birthdays. ""The Beijing Expo is expected to promote a new lifestyle, inspire a better understanding of horticulture and integrate gardening into our lives,"" he said. After the exhibition, the public space will be preserved to develop local tourism and horticulture, according to Ye Dahua, deputy head of the bureau. It will also be a leisure area for local residents and also a new attraction for tourists to enjoy floral sightseeing tours, he said. Dai Bin, president of the China Tourism Academy, said Yanqing district will play host to both the exhibition and the 2022 Winter Olympics, which will provide perfect opportunities to develop the local comprehensive tourism."

This year's holiday, from May 1 to 4, is a day longer than previous years and suitable for outbound long-distance trips, said the NIA, adding that passenger volumes at major airports in places such as Beijing and Shanghai would increase notably. It anticipates that the average daily tourist flow at the Beijing Capital International Airport and Shanghai Pudong International Airport will reach 79,000 and 107,000 respectively. The ports at different ends of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge are expected to see a daily average of 105,000 entry and exit trips during the holiday. More than 670,000 arrivals and departures will be made on average each day via the three ports of Luohu, Futian and Huanggang, which connect the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong, as well as at West Kowloon Station of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link, the NIA predicted. It expects that the Gongbei Port linking the mainland and Macao will see an average of 435,000 inbound and outbound trips each day. The NIA has called on border check agencies to release timely information of the passenger flow and ensure safe and orderly trips for tourists. The NIA also recommended that passengers check their travel documents in advance and avoid traveling at rush periods if possible."
1,"DALIAN - With renewed pledges to transition its economy and defend free and fair trade, China has reasserted its role as an anchor of growth and globalization in front of the world's political and business leaders who assembled in Dalian to draw a blueprint for an inclusive future. From Tuesday to Thursday, around 1,500 politicians, officials, entrepreneurs, scholars and media representatives from more than 90 countries and regions discussed topics from inclusive growth to the new industrial revolution at the Annual Meeting of the New Champions 2017, also called the Summer Davos. Established by the World Economic Forum (WEF) in 2007, the summer forum is held each year in China, alternating between the port cities of Dalian and Tianjin. With the quickest GDP increase for 18 months in the first quarter of this year, China is making efforts needed to put flagging global growth back on track. ""China's growth is an incredible contribution to the global economy,"" said Klaus Schwab, the WEF's founder and executive chairman. China has been a major stabilizer and driving force for the world economy, contributing more than 30 percent of recent growth. GDP in the first quarter grew 6.9 percent year-on-year from the same period in 2016. Premier Li Keqiang, addressing the opening of the gathering, said the economy has become more stable and sustainable through steady transformation. China took neither strong stimulus measures nor followed the old investment-driven, resource-reliant path, but strived to innovate and reform in its economic shift to consumption and the service industry, Li said. Official data showed that consumption contributed 64.6 percent of GDP in 2016, while the tertiary sector accounted for 51.6 percent. From bike sharing to mobile payments to e-commerce, China's nascent emerging sectors and enthusiasm for innovation are underpinning inclusive growth. New momentum, including new industries and new business models, contributed around 70 percent of all new urban jobs last year, said the premier. ""China is undoubtedly the leader in the sharing economy, which injects new vitality into the broader growth and helps reforms,"" said Ge Hong, Airbnb vice-president. The home-sharing company remains upbeat about the Chinese market and economy with plans to increase its presence this year. The Summer Davos has been held in China for a decade and shows China is no longer an economy based on manufacturing but has great potential to move very fast into the era of the fourth industrial revolution, Schwab said. China will continue to maintain medium-high growth with its huge market potential and creativity from a population of more than 1.3 billion, the premier said. The premier believes that in the short term, the economy is resilient and this years' growth target－around 6.5 percent－is attainable. Financial institutions, including the International Monetary Fund, have upgraded their forecast for China, encouraged by new impetus and progress in economic re-balancing. Li Daokui, an economist at Tsinghua University, is optimistic, predicting growth will accelerate in 2018 with rising private investment and improved government efficiency. As protectionism rises, the forum in Dalian is an opportunity for inspiration. Premier Li said in his speech that countries must safeguard economic globalization to achieve inclusive growth, Globalization means the free flow of merchandise, capital and human resources, creating a bigger market and more choice for consumers that benefit all countries, he said. The problems facing different countries are not due to globalization itself, but because of their inability to address it, he noted. ""It does not make sense to blame a rough road and stop moving if I sprain my ankle."" Defending the authority and effectiveness of multilateralism, the premier said no country should impose unilateral rules on others, or politicize fair trade. David Wu, senior partner of PwC China's Beijing branch, pointed to China as a staunch defender of economic globalization. Inclusive growth that China has been championing is an effective solution to the difficulties facing globalization and the world economy, Wu told Xinhua after the opening ceremony. China will expand market access in the service and manufacturing sectors, relax restrictions on foreign ownership, and treat Chinese and foreign companies on an equal basis, Premier Li said. To make it easier for foreigners to set up enterprises, in some cities Chinese, foreign companies already go through registration procedures at the same window, Li said. ""All companies that are registered in China will be eligible to enjoy the same supportive policies which China makes, in accordance with WTO rules, to push forward the 'Made in China 2025' strategy and promote innovation,"" he said. Wu said companies of all countries could share the opportunities provided by the Chinese economy."

Souvenirs available include a range of traditional cultural gifts, from typical Chinese food to dolls portraying characters from Peking Opera. A string of time-honored brands, including Quanjude Roast Duck, Daoxiangcun pastries, Yueshengzhai, a brand selling pickled beef and mutton for more than 230 years, are among those that are available on the platform. ""We have developed gifts that are a combination of both traditional culture and modern elements,"" said Zhang Yihu, founder and CEO of Times Tech, ToGo's parent company, whose business covers technology, e-commerce, media and entertainment. The platform is also cooperating with Dream Castle Culture, an intellectual property company that owns the image rights for Ali, a popular online animation character depicting a fox, to jointly develop interesting and creative souvenirs. Zhang said that though the online e-commerce market is dominated by Alibaba's Taobao and JD, there are still huge opportunities for players like ToGo. ""The tourism market in the country has been growing steadily with a steady influx of domestic tourists. This is an uncharted territory where we hope we can tap into the full potential,"" he added.

He said that more and more travelers are increasingly seeking unique local souvenirs. ""But an increasing number of imitations and duplicates are posing problems for tourists and imposing a reputation pressure on the tourism authorities."" According to Zhang, ToGo will help supplement the parent company's online business and cash in on the emerging opportunities from the country's e-commerce boom. The firm aims to integrate at least 10,000 local tourist guides and 200 travel agencies in Beijing to further expand its business. ""ToGo aims to generate a revenue of 300 million yuan ($43.2 million) to 400 million yuan from Beijing and a total revenue of 2 billion yuan in the next three years,"" he said."
0,"Israeli award-winning director, Dan Wolman, introduced   and five other movies to Chinese audience in Beijing to show local customs of this West Asian land. The event kicked-off with  staring Adi Bielski and Aviv Alush, on Monday. The film is based on Israeli theatre and movie actress Pnina Gary’s true life story during the period between 1942 through 1948. “It is a very simple but delicate love story of a woman,” said Wolman. “There’s something I really want to capture – the innocence of that period of time, that people were idealistic and willing to sacrifice themselves for their ideal.” The story takes place in 1942 when young Margalit first met her love, Ami. Under the turbulent situation, these two kept missing each other until they met again in a Kibbutz, a type of farm in Israel where many people live and work together. They fell in love and decided to marry on Purim, a Jewish holiday. As they were preparing the wedding, Ami and six others were trapped and killed. Born in 1941, Wolman was familiar with the songs and dresses in the story. “She told me her story which was one-sided, and I had to make it more complex so that it can touch you to feel the tragedy. So I added some little things that made the story believable.” “I hope to touch people and to make them feel something,” said Wolman. “I just try to do what I can do.” This is not Wolman’s first time in Beijing. In 2011, he took home the trophy of ""Best Foreign Film"" chosen by the audience at Golden Rooster - One Hundred flower Film Festival"" in China. It was also then that Wolman began to get involved in Chinese film industry. Wolman also volunteers to increase collaboration between the two countries’ film industries. For example, he has worked with students from National Academy of Chinese Theatre Arts on a film about Chinese opera. Five more Wolman’s films are on display:      and  .

These companies all succeeded raising funds over the past year, with totals exceeding 5 billion yuan ($719 million). Their average valuation is close to 3.5 billion yuan, with four companies growing to become ""unicorns"" — startups valued at over $1 billion. For years, China has promoted mass entrepreneurship and innovation to boost employment, optimize the economic structure and facilitate a shift of growth engines. Li Xiaoqiang, president of an internet investment fund, noted entrepreneurship is in a golden age as the country's internet still has big room for growth. ""The internet penetration rate for developed countries hit 80 percent, while China stands at less than 60 percent, meaning there is still huge growth potential,"" he said."

The team has members from the administration and several other government bodies, including the National Health Commission, and is headed by administration Party chief Li Li, it said. More than 400,000 doses of substandard DTaP vaccine — meant to prevent diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough in infants — was produced by Wuhan Institute of Biological Products Co and sold to Chongqing municipality and Hebei province, the administration said in November. The administration said in a statement on Tuesday that a temporary malfunction of equipment on the company’s production line led to an uneven amount of liquid in vaccines being packaged, making them ineffective. The company recalled all unused DTaP vaccines following the discovery of the problem and destroyed them under the supervision of the local drug authority in May, the administration said. The company also improved quality control of its products and training for staff following the incident, and inspections conducted by the administration found all subsequent DTaP vaccines produced by the company met standards, it said."

The two high-tech lines and one conventional tram will bring the number of lines in the capital to 22, covering a total of 608 kilometers, the Beijing Commission of Transport said. The 10.2-km S1 Line will be Beijing's first mid-to low-speed Maglev line, and has a top speed of 100 km/h. It will link the city's western districts of Mentougou and Shijingshan, and passengers can ride the entire line in less than 20 minutes. Maglev trains rely on electromagnetic forces that elevate carriages about 1 centimeter above the tracks, considerably reducing friction and providing a smooth ride. The 16.6-km Yanfang Line is the Chinese mainland's first domestically made driverless subway. It has a seating capacity of 960 and a top speed of 80 km/h. The line connects Beijing's southwestern Yanshan and Fangshan areas, aiming to facilitate development. Beijing's first modern tram, which will operate in Haidian district on the city's west side, will also welcome passengers on Saturday. Known as the Xijiao Line, it will be popular for sightseeing because it passes eight attractions, including the Summer Palace, Beijing Botanical Garden and Fragrant Hills Park. It runs mainly at ground level, but may rise or go underground as the road system requires. ""In addition to the increase of lines, we will also raise the comfort level of railways,"" said Zhou Zhengyu, director of the commission.

1,"Researchers have called for greater efforts to build internet infrastructure in Central China to improve the internet literacy of the region's young people.  The competence of using the internet among young people in this part of the country falls behind that of their peers in other areas, according to a survey by Guangming Daily and Beijing Normal University's School of Journalism and Communication, released in June.  More than 7,000 young people from 22 provinces and regions were polled about their behavior while using the internet, including how they manage their attention when surfing, how they search for and make use of information, and how they analyze and evaluate information.  The survey found that respondents from Central China scored lower in the survey than those in the eastern and western regions.  In response, researchers suggested authorities and educators build better internet infrastructure, to make the internet more accessible to young people and improve their internet literacy.  Statistics from the China Internet Network Information Center show that, as of June, China had 751 million internet users. One in five were aged 10 to 19.  The survey found that for young people aged 12 to 18, the internet is integral to their education, entertainment, social lives and self-expression.      However, in contrast, young people's internet competence does not match their frequent usage.  Researchers evaluated each person polled based on their responses in five aspects, including protecting their personal information online, searching the internet, and attitudes toward other users. The average score was only 3.55 points from a maximum five points.  The survey also found that young urban residents of first-or second-tier cities in eastern China with better academic performances at school have comparatively better internet competence than peers.  It also found that a respondent's access to digital devices, relationship with his or her parents, and the frequency with which they talked about the internet with their parents had an impact on internet competence.  ""The more digital devices young people can access in their daily lives, and the more young people talk with parents, the better they will be at collecting, using, analyzing and evaluating information on the internet,"" the report said.  The report suggested that parents control children's internet access, set up family rules for internet usage, and talk with children often to help them to develop good surfing habits.  Zhang Yanqiu, a professor of media research at the Communication University of China, said family plays an increasingly important role in improving young people's internet competence.  ""In that sense, parents' internet competence is of equal importance,"" she said. ""This, in addition to how a child's internet competence influences that of parents, could be new angles of research."""
1,"The Beijing municipal government is breathing life back into the brick-and-mortar bookstore industry as it faces pressure from the booming e-commerce sector, soaring rents and the growing popularity of digital books. Since the emergence of e-commerce and digital reading materials, their convenience and cheaper prices have presented a challenge for physical bookstores. Despite Ernest Hemingway's belief that ""There is no friend as loyal as a book"", it is now easier to find a coffee shop in Beijing than a bookstore. Thus, the Beijing government in July announced a plan to support bookstores by providing 50 million yuan ($7.33 million) per year to help establish more than 150 bookstores over the next few years. The city will also encourage an influential bookstore chain to set up branches in busy streets, commercial centers, residential areas and at tourist attractions to improve visibility. In fact, the book retail business has been slowly gaining momentum in recent years. According to Openbook, a market information service provider, in 2017, the book retail market reached 80.3 billion yuan for the first time, up 14.55 percent year-on-year. The physical bookstore sector showed positive growth of 2.33 percent year-on-year with market size reaching 34.4 billion yuan. Although the numbers show some positive signs for brick-and-mortar bookstores, the profits of such shops are shrinking. Qu Defang, general manager of Sanlian Taofen Bookstore, said the company generated 11 million yuan in 2017, with a profit of 360,000 yuan. ""With each book we sold we profited less than one yuan,"" Qu said. ""My secondhand Kindle cost about 300 yuan, and I can download books for free,"" said Huang Tiange, a 30-year-old medical doctor in Ningbo, Zhejiang province. ""It is thin, portable and cheap."" Yan Bofei, CEO of Shanghai Jifeng Bookstore, an independent bookshop that had to shut down earlier this year, said soaring rents were the initial pressure bookstore operators faced. ""In the past two decades, the country's land prices have jumped multiple times but the sales revenue of books has only increased by one-fourth,"" he said. Facing the challenges, a number of determined entrepreneurs have realized selling books alone is not enough to survive. Many new feature bookstores have emerged, combining traditional bookstores with cafes, event venues, even clothing and furniture stores. One such store is Fangsuo, which started in Guangzhou, South China's Guangdong province, and has gradually set up branches in central business districts in Chengdu in Sichuan province, Qingdao in Shandong province, and Chongqing. ""Many think the physical bookstore is on the verge of death. But in fact, it has moved onto the right track,"" said Mao Jihong, founder of Fangsuo, as the store's Chengdu branch has broken even for two years. ""I want it to change how people use space in the city,"" Mao said. ""In the past, the central commercial district was used for shopping, and shopping took up a large part of urban residents' leisure time. ""We aim to bring books, cultural exhibitions and art activities to central areas despite sky-high rents, so people can enjoy books, culture and art while shopping."""
0,"Children's books were a highlight at Beijing International Book Fair, which concluded Sunday. This year, an exhibition of children's books covering around 20,000 square meters was held for the first time as part of the fair, China's key international book fair and copyright trading platform. Firms and publishers from countries including China, Japan, the Republic of Korea and France displayed different kinds of books, such as picture books, pop-up books, audio-books, comics and graphic novels, at the exhibition. As Chinese parents attach more importance to the reading and education of their children, and the country has ended its decades-long one-child policy, the children's book market in China has great potential with growing demand. According to an industry report, China's retail book market size surpassed 80 billion yuan (about $11.6 billion ) in 2017, up 14.55 percent year on year. Children's books were the main driver of market growth, with the children's sector accounting for over one-third of the overall growth in the Chinese market. ""There are more books available for children on the market. We're happy to see that children not only love reading but also start writing and creating illustrations,"" said Liu Dan, director with Beijing United Tianchang Culture Communication Co., Ltd. More than 2,500 exhibitors from 93 countries and regions took part in the Beijing International Book Fair which opened on Aug 22, displaying 300,000 books."
0,"For Wang Rongpei and the other volunteers at the legal aid center of Renmin University of China in Beijing, offering their services for free is not only socially beneficial, but also a good way of improving their professional skills. Founded in 1998, the center mainly consists of graduate law students from the university who want to put what they have learned at school to practical use. The 200-plus volunteers take turns providing services part time at the Supreme People's Court and Haidian District People's Court in Beijing. ""Those who ask us for legal help are mainly migrant workers, older people, students and women; people who know little about the law and do not know how to seek legal help if their rights are violated,"" Wang said. ""They feel more comfortable explaining their problems to students because it is easier to communicate with us, compared with lawyers who are legally required to provide a certain amount of free legal aid,"" the 24-year-old added. ""We treat each complaint very seriously, and many of us will spend months on a case, preparing the necessary paperwork, doing research and seeking help from our teachers to ensure our clients get the best legal services."" Last year, the center offered its services to more than 1,000 people and helped to retrieve more than 300,000 yuan ($44,500) that was owed to them. It also provided legal awareness campaigns for migrant workers and primary and secondary school students. ""Sometimes, we find it hard to balance our school work with legal aid because it is very time-consuming to prepare for different cases, but most of us find it rewarding to offer help to others,"" Wang said. ""It's not just about the clients who receive help from us. We are also gaining practical training we cannot learn at school, and that helps to prepare us to become better legal professionals when we graduate."""
0,"BEIJING - The Beijing municipal government will start providing financial subsidies to kindergartens this year in efforts to improve services without raising fees. The municipal government said Wednesday that it would provide 1,000 yuan (154 US dollars) per child a month to the city's first-class public kindergartens, and 700 yuan per child a month to other kindergartens. The government will for the first time also allow private kindergartens to join the kindergarten rating held by district education commissions. In the past, only public kindergartens could join the rating, which is often related to different levels of government subsidies. The municipal government has reinforced supervision over kindergartens after a teacher from a private kindergarten allegedly abused children. The teacher surnamed Liu, at the RYB Education New World kindergarten in Chaoyang District, was arrested in December 2017, after the procuratorate of Beijing Chaoyang District pressed charges against Liu, accusing her of using sewing needles to ""discipline"" children who would not sleep. The child abuse scandal caused widespread public outrage. The government said it would provide incentives to both public and private kindergartens starting this year, to increase enrollment by giving 10,000 yuan for increasing the student quota by one. It will also offer rental subsidies to kindergartens, of 5 yuan per square meter per day, to increase space. For private kindergartens to enjoy the subsidies, they must register as non-profit kindergartens and can only charge fees in accordance with the government guiding prices. The kindergartens are not allowed to raise fees to provide extra services or classes."

Thanks to his familiarity with pop culture, Taniguchi's designs, Miraitowa and Someity, were selected as the official mascots of the 2020 Summer Olympics and Paralympics to be held in Japan. Through these two fictional characters, Taniguchi showcases his understanding of Japanese culture. The characters sport traditional checkered ichimatsu patterns, and they wear helmets that are like the ones worn by the samurai. Taniguchi says the designs show the all-embracing side of Japanese culture, and adds that he came up with the designs at the Beijing 2022 Mascots Design Forum held on Oct 7, at the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing. The event was to draw on the legacy of the image designing of previous Olympic Games, and to inspire the development of mascot designs and merchandise for the 2022 Winter Olympics to be held in Beijing and the towns in neighboring Hebei province. The forum also featured Maria Elizabeth da Silva Lula who was the brand director of the organizing committee for the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro and Chinese designer Yue Xin, a five time-winner of the prestigious Red Dot Award."
0,"Parents and educators have welcomed government moves to make kindergartens safer, cheaper, more convenient and simply more available. But for now, things can be rough for some parents. Han Jun, who works in Beijing, for example, has put his 3-year-old son into a private kindergarten for two basic reasons－availability and quality. ""It is very difficult to get your child enrolled in public kindergartens because there are not enough of them, and I also worry about my son learning little at public kindergartens since they are forbidden from teaching any primary school material"" such as math, Chinese and English, said Han, who is in his early 30s. Private kindergartens charge fees ranging from 5,000 yuan ($720) to 20,000 yuan a month in Beijing, while public ones cost just several hundred yuan a month, he said. The high cost has presented Han with a huge financial challenge as he and his wife together earn about 20,000 yuan a month. The private preschool their son attends costs 7,000 yuan a month. They first considered enrolling their son in a cheaper public kindergarten that charges about 500 yuan, but the only public school with a good reputation nearby is reserved for residents in an area where land prices are nearly twice as high as where Han lives. Children attending inexpensive public kindergartens (or low-priced private ones) will account for 80 percent of all preschoolers by 2020, according to a directive jointly issued recently by the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council. By 2035, three-year preschool education will be available for all children between the ages of 3 and 6, and a national preschool network will be established, it said. Affordable preschools will be the priority of the campaign, the document said. Governments at all levels are encouraged to establish public kindergartens, in a bid to put about 50 percent of all preschool children into public education by 2020. Communities, State-owned enterprises and public institutions such as universities are also encouraged to establish their own kindergartens. Wang Yan, a public kindergarten teacher in Changsha, Hunan province, said the main reason for the shortage of public kindergartens is the difficulty of finding teachers. ""The pay is bad, despite the heavy social responsibility we carry,"" she said. Wang is busy caring for and teaching children during the day, while her evenings are devoted to preparing for the next day's games and events and addressing a never-ending stream of questions and requests from the children's parents. Despite all these responsibilities, her monthly pay is 3,500 yuan, less than the city average. Lyu Yugang, director of the Basic Education Department of the Ministry of Education, said the government will make sure that all kindergarten teachers, private or public, earn a decent salary. Their basic benefits, including insurance and housing funds, should also be paid in full and with no delays, he told a recent news conference. Although it is still premature to include three years of preschool education in the country's compulsory, free education program, the government will spare no effort to deepen reform and better regulate the sector to make sure more students enjoy an inclusive, affordable and high-quality preschool education, he added. Chu Zhaohui, a senior researcher at the National Institute of Education Sciences, said the guideline shows the government's determination to provide affordable education. Kindergarten teachers should have better salaries and a good working atmosphere so that more qualified individuals will apply for such jobs and college students majoring in preschool education will not opt for another profession, he said."

During the three-day Meeting of the New Champions 2017, more than 2,000 participants including officials and entrepreneurs from over 90 countries and regions shared their insights on economic globalization challenges, the sharing economy and new technology.  The meeting was themed ""Achieving Inclusive Growth in the Fourth Industrial Revolution."" Attendees tried to find ways to achieve a more inclusive style of growth that prioritizes meaningful job creation and sustainable development.  China will increase access to the service and manufacturing sectors, relax restrictions on foreign ownership, and treat Chinese and foreign companies on an equal basis, said Premier Li Keqiang at the opening ceremony of the forum on Tuesday.  ""We will further ease market access in service and manufacturing sectors, relax foreign equity caps in some areas of interest, advance and improve the negative-list regulation model. Domestic and foreign companies are treated equally in the application of supportive policies,"" he said.  The meeting highlighted China's economy.  ""China's growth is an incredible contribution to the global economy,"" said Klaus Schwab, the World Economic Forum (WEF) founder and executive chairman.  China has been a major stabilizer and driving force for the world economy, contributing more than 30 percent of recent growth. Its GDP in Q1 grew 6.9 percent year on year from the same period in 2016.  Li Daokui, an economist with Beijing-based Tsinghua University, is optimistic, predicting growth will accelerate next year with rising private investment and improved government efficiency.  ""It is forecast the growth speed (of China's economy) this year will be the same as last year. In 2018, the economy will begin to go upward, largely due to rising private investment,"" said Li.  According to Sun Pishu, chairman of China's cloud computing and big data provider Inspur Group, the country's supply-side structural reform has delivered success.  ""Profound changes have taken place in China's economic structure, with growth engines shifting to innovation and investment becoming steadier,"" said Sun.

""Compared with studying Chinese in foreign countries, international students can learn a great deal when they spend time with Chinese people immersing in surrounding Chinese culture,""Ogarek Marta Barbara, a teacher accompanying the Polish students on the program, said.  Ogarek now works for the Confucius Institute in Krakow, the second largest city in Poland.  ""The institute organizes Polish students to visit China every summer,"" she said in fluent Chinese.  A total of 17 Polish students participate in the program, with most visiting China for the first time. ""Something happened which makes students excited and surprised during the trip, they ask me a heap of questions every day,"" Ogarek noted. ""They didn't know much about China except Chinese food and kungfu. Through the well-scheduled trip, they will obtain a more vivid view of life in China than the internet gives them,""she said. The summer camp program includes visiting places of interest, art appreciation and viewing folk customs, as well as attending the cultural corner and specially-prepared group activities without borders. About 120 students from seven countries, who are either registered students at Confucius Institutes or students of primary and secondary school courses of Confucius Institutes attend the BFSU summer camp this year.  In a painting class on Monday, Adam Chimielecki drew a picture of a Chinese Panda.  Before coming to Beijing for summer camp, 18-year-old Adam has studied Chinese for two years, and said he had never tried to craft a Chinese painting.  Li He, an art teacher at the summer camp, said he designed lessons in accordance with an easy-to-difficult schedule.  ""It's not easy to international students to grasp the essentials of wash painting in the limited period of time, from careful control of ink tone, unrestrained brushwork, and no unessential brush strokes,"" he said. However, Li add students learnt the techniques well and their panda works are always beyond his expectations.  ""By practicing more, the students learn faster,"" he said. Adam said he has been crazy at reading Chinese masterpiece Art of War since he was a little boy. He added he was also fascinated with Chinese traditional medicine under the influence of his father and fond of Chinese point of view of the world.  ""Chinese people like to play tai chi or martial arts. They are pleasant, positive and polite,"" he said. The summer camp is also an incredible experience to make more friends similar in age. During the cultural corner activity, students from different countries share the most characteristic clothes, food and games with their global peers.  ""They gather, talk with each other and listen to music,"" Margot Bremner, a teacher accompanying students from London for the third time, said. ""They get the freedom to meet more new friends without nationalities.""  Just four days after this summer camp begins, another summer camp targeted on Confucius institutes from central and eastern European countries will have an opening ceremony at the BFSU campus.  ""BFSU is one of the few major universities in the country that have the resources to teach less commonly taught languages, so it can help set up Confucius Institute in countries such as Hungary, Poland, Bulagria, Italy and so on,"" Zhu Qi, who works at BFSU Confucius Institute and in charge of the summer camp programs, said."
0,"In the past three years, Beijing has seen a growing number of labor disputes involving legal questions about employer-employee relationships. Many of the disputes have centered on smartphone applications, as the mobile economy has developed rapidly, courts in the capital reported on Tuesday. With more people working for increasingly prosperous internet platforms since 2015 - especially smartphone applications that provide car-hailing and food services - app operators have been taken to court more frequently, Beijing High People's Court said. ""Such new labor cases have been a challenge for our hearings, and the number is still going up,"" the court told China Daily, though it did not give an exact citywide figure. On Tuesday, a report made by Chaoyang District People's Court said that it heard 188 such lawsuits from January 2015 to March this year; Haidian District People's Court concluded 55 such cases between January 2016 and February this year. Different from traditional employment, the mobile app job is ""flexible"", said Wu Kemeng, a judge in Chaoyang. ""Some app platforms without fixed workplaces are more like a bridge connecting customers and service providers, and many workers don't need a full day at work."" ""That is to say, it's difficult to verify whether there is a labor relationship between the free workers and the app platforms. This is the focus of many lawsuits as well as the challenge in the hearings,"" he said. ""Some agreements between app operators and workers can only be regarded as cooperation or information sharing, which means the providers in these cases are not protected under the Labor Law,"" he said. In June 2016, for example, the court rejected the claim of an employment relationship between 56 people and Mei Mei Da, a popular beauty app, because the workers had only provided nail-painting services in accordance with customers information collected by the platform. ""The workers made decisions on when and where to provide the services by themselves, and they didn't agree on salaries with the app operators,"" said Xiao Wei, another judge of the court. ""In other words, the platform just shared clients' information with them instead of managing them."" She warned job seekers to be more careful, ""as people without a labor relationship cannot get social insurance under the law"". ""If an app platform requires a certain working time and place and has a system for governing attendance, its agreement with service providers may be more easily identified as a labor relationship,"" she added. Wang Yan, a judge from Haidian district, suggested the city's labor administrations strengthen supervision of app platforms to prevent them from intentionally shirking their responsibilities or cheating job-seekers. ""As the apps bring more job opportunities, they must be better regulated,"" she said."

Organized by Beijing municipal government, Expo 2019 Beijing will open on April 29. According to the organizer, the preparatory work has entered the final stage. Wang Hong, vice mayor of Beijing, deputy director and deputy secretary-general of the executive committee of Expo 2019 Beijing said that all the preparations for the exhibition are ready. It is estimated that about 110 international exhibitors and more than 120 non-official international organizations will join the 162-day expo. She also indicated that the opening ceremony, the opening activities, National Museum's Day professional summit, international competition, and more than 2,500 series of activities, so that visitors enjoy the international gardening feast, at the same time, experience the diversity of cultural feast around the world. According to the overall arrangement of the preparatory work, the focus of the next stage will be shifted to indoor exhibition arrangement, exhibition services, and operation management during the expo. ""The expo marks a new driving force for the development of China's flower industry,"" said Jiang Zehui, President of China Flower Association, and Vice-president of Organizing Committee of Expo 2019 Beijing. From 1984 to 2017, the area of flowers and plants in China increased from 14,000 hectares to 1.4 million hectares, the sales volume increased from 600 million yuan to 153.3 billion yuan, and the export volume increased from tens of millions of U.S. dollars to more than 600 million U.S. dollars. ""China has become the world's largest flower production center, also, an important flower consumer and flower import and export trading country,"" said Jiang. ""Hosting Expo 2019 will also bring new opportunities for global cooperation,"" she added. ""The horticulture industry is a sunshine industry,"" said Zhou Jianping, Executive Deputy Director-General of Beijing World Horticultural Expo Coordination Bureau. Zhou mentioned that when people meet the basic needs of life, they will chase higher requirements for the quality of life and more yearning for a better life. In his opinion, this is the reason why the flower industry has entered every citizen's family and become an indispensable part of people's life. ""I believe that by holding such an expo, the flower horticulture industry will get a great development,"" Zhou added. Also, the Expo also put forward the concept of ""ecological priority"" by diversity, respecting the basic idea of environmental protection. As Zhou said, the organizing committee has ensured the original trees through various technical means, leaving nearly 50,000 original trees in the park. It is these original trees that provide a green shade for the exhibition. Besides, the International competition is an important part of the expo, more than half a year, during which many international competitions and competitions will be held. Expo 2017 was held inAstana,Kazakhstan."
0,"Chinese judges say they are giving high priority to the enforcement of monetary judgments and are ordering stiff punishments for people who fail to comply. It's part of a redoubled effort to uphold justice and improve the rule of law, they say. ""We've increased the efficiency and accuracy of tracking down defaulters and their properties by cooperating with public security bureaus, banks and real estate registration entities,"" Beijing judge Chen Changyi said. He made the remark during a news conference in Beijing dealing with how judges serve the people, which was presented by the State Council Information Office on Wednesday. ""We've also strengthened penalties for people who are able to obey our rulings, such as someone who has the money to pay back a debt but refuses to do so,"" he added. Chen, from the capital's Haidian District People's Court, said his court has punished 286 defaulters since the start of 2017. The amount of money they refused to pay reached 2 billion yuan ($331 million). ""We also used WeChat to collect clues about defaulters and their properties last year,"" he said. Jiang Ying, a Beijing Intellectual Property Court judge, said the greatest difficulty in implementing IP-related verdicts is stopping defendants from harming plaintiffs' IP rights. ""We can't monitor defendants every day to see whether they were still damaging others' trademarks, copyrights or patents,"" she said. To solve the problem, a person whose IP rights have been damaged is allowed to file another lawsuit asking a court to increase the level of punishment, she said. In one trademark dispute, for example, Jiang's court tripled the amount of damages it had ordered a man to pay - to 600,000 yuan from the original 200,000 yuan - after repeated infringements. ""Such moves can threaten the infringer and speed up enforcement, as well as better protect IP rights,"" she added. Judges in Guangdong province have also made greater efforts to push people to comply with verdicts, especially when carrying out rulings in domestic cases or those involving juveniles, such as urging divorced defendants to pay child support, according to Chen Haiyi, a judge of the Guangzhou Intermediate People's Court. Since 2015, the Supreme People's Court has vowed to fight defaulters and take steps against them, as the problem often surfaces in public complaints. Now, people who fail to carry out verdicts will be prohibited from buying airline and high-speed rail tickets and face restrictions in purchasing luxury goods. As of March 29, 10.15 million airplane trips and 3.91 million rail trips have been blocked, the court said."
0,"TAIYUAN - A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.  The 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children. The students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called ""A Tiny Classroom of Love,"" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children. The school was officially founded in 2011, offering both primary and middle school education.  The gaokao is of vital importance to Chinese students, with millions of candidates participating every year.  ""We just made the place where they study and live as the exam site,"" said Guo Xiaoping, principal of the school and former president of Linfen Third People's Hospital.  He said the decision to set separate exam rooms was out of care for the children, who were infected with HIV from mother-to-child transmission.  ""The school is a half-hour ride from the general exam site. It is not convenient to take them to go to another place for the exam,"" Guo said. ""If the children take the exams with other candidates, I fear they may feel nervous and others will protest.""  However, after many years working against AIDS discrimination, the school underestimated growing acceptance of people with HIV.  ""Separate exam rooms objectively create a discriminatory atmosphere,"" Wang Linghang, a doctor with Beijing Ditan Hospital, told Beijing News. ""Obviously, there is no transmission risk when HIV students take the exams together with other candidates.""  ""The personal privacy of HIV people should be protected. If these children do not take the exams in separate rooms, who will know they are HIV carriers?"" said Bai Hua, leader of a Beijing-based AIDS organization. ""The exam rooms are distributed randomly to candidates. Other students will not know they are HIV carriers.""  However, some supported the school's decision.  ""Separate sites can remove the worry of others and provide free space for people with HIV infection. This is not discrimination,"" said a user of Weibo, a Twitter-like service. ""The social reality is that many people are afraid of contacting AIDS and that cannot be changed currently.""  ""It is not a matter of discrimination, but the kids' safety. We could not rule out any possibility of infection, such as the virus passing through blood in wounds,"" said another internet user.  Xiong Bingqi, of the 21st Century Education Research Institute, said the separate exam rooms were meant to provide a good environment, and it was important that the students were given equal education rights.  ""There is still a long way to go to completely eradicate discrimination against people living with AIDS/HIV,"" he said.  In China, about 654,000 people live with HIV/AIDS."

Wang Huning also attended the event. In a speech to declare the beginning of the carnival, Xi said Asian cultures demonstrate great richness and vitality thanks to the diversity of Asian civilizations. ""Tonight, the colorful flowers of Asian cultures will blossom in full,"" he said. ""Arts will transcend the boundaries of nations, touch people right in the heart and connect their minds, showing to the world a radiant, dynamic, peaceful and progressive Asia."" Chinese people sincerely hope that Asian countries will help each other and work closely together to advance with the rest of the world, he said. The same stadium, also known as the Bird's Nest, was the stage of the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics Games in 2008. Around 30,000 audience from home and abroad watched artists from across Asia perform folk dances, play traditional musical instruments or sing popular songs from their homeland. Upasana Madan, an Indian dancer, said she felt thrilled to be back on a Chinese stage 18 years after a three-week performing tour in China. ""Everyone is coming and sharing their cultures. We see artists from other countries and understand their cultures through their dance and music,"" she said. ""It is beautiful how this program is bringing all these countries together."" Apanaeva Gyuzel, who led a team of Russian artists to attend the carnival, told Xinhua that she and her fellow artists were honored to present Russian culture at the event and carefully chose a dance that could best showcase the characteristics of Russian people. ""The stage, equipped with the latest visual technologies, is very impressive, and the show is so spectacular. We learned a lot and made many friends,"" she said. ""It is indeed a great journey."" The audience was fascinated by the performances and visual effects of the stage, as many stood up, applauded, and waved glow sticks in their hands, singing and swaying with the music. ""This show brings back memories of the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics. I was overwhelmed tonight,"" said Tang Yuting, a student from a Beijing college. ""The conference is a very good opportunity to promote our own culture and to better understand the outside world."""

Tapia will travel to Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Wuhan, Honk Kong and Chengdu, to meet with manufacturers of electric buses, such as BYD, Yutong and Yinlong.  In Beijing, Tapia will also meet with her Chinese counterpart Li Xiaopeng to discuss mass transit.  As part of a push to transition from fossil-fuel powered buses to electric vehicles, six new public transit suppliers in Santiago will be required by law to include at least 15 electric buses in their fleets by October 2018.  Chinese-made electric buses have already been unveiled in Santiago, and at least three units are to begin circulating soon as a pilot program gets underway.

0,"When late Cambodian king Norodom Sihanouk's late son Norodom Naradipo studied at Beijing No 25 Middle School, he was curious about how ancient Chinese referred to his motherland. After Niu Chongyang, his history teacher, told him it was Zhen La (Khmer) in Mandarin, the boy felt more confused because zhen la can also mean ""really spice"" in Chinese. This anecdote alongside dozens of less well-known stories will feature in an upcoming documentary series The Road to Friendship between China and Cambodia (Zhong Jian Youyi Zhi Lu), which will air on CCTV-4, one of China Central Television's Chinese international channels. The five-episode documentary, which has been produced to mark the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two countries, recreates many historical moments from the 1950s through the 1990s. Most of the content centers on Sihanouk, a key figure in Cambodian politics for more than six decades, and looks at his contributions, his friendships with Chinese leaders, as well as his life in exile in China. Unlike most documentaries that employ a chronological order to narrate the stories, the production begins with the 1970s and moves to the 1950s in the second episode, with the third one about Sihanouk's friendship with former premier Zhou En'lai and the fourth about his return to China in 1979. The year 1970 marked a turning point for Sihanouk, says director Li Yun, adding that during his visit to Moscow on March 18, 1970, then-Cambodian prime minister Lon Nol and his followers staged a coup to overthrow Sihanouk, causing Sihanouk to head to China. ""We obtained a video recording of his departure from an airport in Moscow for Beijing. ""In the past, Chinese TV programs have broadcast just a few minutes of this, but we got the original version which runs for more than 20 minutes,"" says Li. To accurately portray history, the crew interviewed a number of people who were part of the story, including She Chunshu, a retired official who worked as a translator for Sihanouk for a long time, and Fu Xuezhang, the former Chinese ambassador to Cambodia.,Fu recalls that the staff of the Chinese embassy in Cambodia were confined to the embassy, which was monitored by a local military force sent by Nol after China refused to recognize his regime. She, who was 29 at the time, was recruited to work for a Chinese government office that looked after Sihanouk and his family after the coup. He recalls that Zhou gave Sihanouk a warm welcome when he arrived in Beijing after being overthrown in the coup. But Sihanouk's friendship with Zhou can be traced back to the 1955 Bandung Conference, a large-scale international meeting to unite Asian and African countries. After private meetings with Zhou at the Bandung Conference, Sihanouk visited China twice, paving the way for the two countries to establish diplomatic relations in 1958. Among the many stories told in the documentary is one about Sihanouk and his wife Monineath paying their first state visit to China in February in 1956. When they arrived they didn't have winter clothes. So, Zhou asked some local tailors to quickly make outfits for them, which Sihanouk cherished and wore every winter while he was in China. While the first four episodes look back at Sihanouk and his close connections with China, the fifth episode focuses on the more recent past. And it talks of 1992, when China sent peacekeeping personnel to Cambodia following the call of Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the then secretary-general of the United Nations. Li, the director of the TV documentary, says Ma Jidong, a team leader of a military engineering unit of the Chinese peacekeeping force, told him the temperature there was more than 40 C. It was a very harsh environment for Chinese soldiers, who contributed a lot to the friendship between China and Cambodia."

A representative opera piece of the late Chinese theater mogul Mei Lanfang,   tells a love story based on the legend of Xiang Yu - the warlord of the ancient Chu Kingdom - and his beloved consort Yu. Xiang lost a battle for the throne, and Yu committed suicide with his sword. Zhang Huoding, one of the most popular Peking Opera stars in today's China, will take the opera makeover to the stage of the Chang'an Grand Theater on May 25, as the closing show of this year's Meet in Beijing international arts festival. Celebrated Peking Opera artist Gao Mukun will star as Xiang Yu. For 48-year-old Zhang, it's a dream come true. ""It's always been my dream to play concubine Yu since I was learning Peking Opera in Tianjin in the 1980s, but I didn't get the chance,"" Zhang said at a news conference in Beijing on Tuesday. ""I look forward to it very much and I hope the audience will like it."",Zhang is an inheritor of the ""Cheng School"" of Peking Opera, a performing style founded by Cheng Yanqiu (1904-58), one of the great Peking Opera masters of the 20th century. While Mei Lanfang's ""Mei School"" is famous for his smooth, moderate and poised style in playing elegant female roles, Cheng style is known for interpreting tragic women with frequent changes in sounds and rhythm. Though   has long been a masterpiece of the Mei School, Wan Ruixing, renowned Peking Opera composer and player of the   (a high-pitched two-stringed fiddle used in Peking Opera), said the Cheng School's sorrowful tunes and slow rhythm also could be a decent interpretation of concubine Yu's tragic fate. ""There are more tragedies in the Cheng School's plays and the character of Yu and her deep sorrow in the legendary story meet very well with the features of the Cheng School,"" said Wan, who is also responsible for the new play's method of singing tunes.,A former actress from the China National Peking Opera Company, Zhang has performed in sellout shows across China, including a solo show at the Great Hall of the People in 2007. In 2015, Zhang made her US debut at Lincoln Center in New York by performing two famous Peking Opera pieces,  and  . She now spends much of her time teaching Peking Opera at the National Academy of Chinese Theater Arts, one of the top academies of traditional Chinese operas, to pass on the ancient art to younger generations. Peking Opera is a 200-year-old Chinese theater art dating back to the 18th century, which combines speech, song, dance and martial arts. In 2010, UNESCO inscribed it as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity."
1,"Shanghai is the most favorite Chinese city for international talents, followed by Beijing, South China's Guangdong Province and East China's Jiangsu Province, according to a report on regional international talent competitiveness released on Monday. A comprehensive evaluation system was used to value a region's competitiveness of international talents in six dimensions – scale and structure of international talents, as well as innovation, policy, development and living environments. The report was conducted and released by the Center for China and Globalization (CCG) and the Southwestern University of Finance and Economics' Institute of Development Studies. ""With rapid economic globalization, China has become international talents' new choice for long-term development and relocation and regional competition for international talents has begun,"" Wang Huiyao, president of CCG, said. Shanghai beat other cities and scored 65.17 out of 100, or 3.91 out of 6 in global talent competitiveness index, due to the openness of the city, work environment, job opportunities and preferential policies, according to the report.  Beijing, with 3.67 out of 6 in global talent competitiveness index, ranked second in the report, and gathers most of international students due to prestigious universities, such as Tsinghua University and Peking University, available. Although East China's coastal province Jiangsu ranks the fourth, it is home to many foreign companies due to the preferential policies to attract elite-level international talents. Southwest China's Sichuan province, with 1.92 out of 6 in global talent competitiveness index, ranked 10th on the list; however, it was the top among regions in middle and western China, according to the report.  The international talents policy index is an important indicator for a region's competitiveness for international talents, and the policy incentives provide international talents in eastern coastal cities are more favorable than middle and western regions, according to the report. For instance, a medical park in Taizhou city gives each PhD holder an additional subsidy of 20,000 yuan ($3,070) and 150,000 yuan to buy a house, Global Times reported citing Jiangsu's official newspaper, Xinhua Daily. The Shanghai government began a pilot program in 2015 which also allows foreign students with a master's degree from Shanghai universities to start a business after graduating, the Xinhua News Agency reported.  Regional innovative development has been a main trend for international competitiveness, and the increase of regional competiveness can bring new opportunities for a country in global development competition, according to Wang Huiyao, president of the CCG."
1,"BEIJING - Hours after the US administration fired the first shot on Friday, China announced additional tariffs on US goods that are of the same scale and intensity and due to take effect on the same date. China's countermeasure is responsive, passive and reciprocal. The US announcement of imposing additional tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods follows months of shuttle diplomacy between Washington and Beijing. China has shown utmost sincerity in rounds of negotiations with plans to meaningfully increase purchases of US goods and services, to meet demands of Chinese people for higher living standards and help the United States to boost employment. The US side also admitted meaningful progress and important consensus were made in the past rounds of talks, as the two sides vowed not to launch a trade war. But consensus has soon proved to be short-lived after the US side demonstrated flip-flops with an obvious intention to escalate the trade spat. China does not want the trade war, but facing a capricious Washington, China has no choice but to fight back vigorously in defense of its national interests, the trend of globalization and the world's multilateral trading system. In fact, China has prepared for volatile Washington. In the wake of the latest round of talks in Beijing earlier this month, China issued a statement, stressing that the outcome of the talks should be based on the prerequisite that the two parties meet each other halfway and will not engage in a trade war. All economic and trade outcomes of the talks will not take effect if the US side imposes any trade sanctions including raising tariffs. Washington obviously has turned a deft ear to this serious message of China. When it comes to defending national interests, China means business. China said it will impose an additional 25-percent tariffs starting July 6 on 545 products from the US including soybeans, electric cars, orange juice, whiskey, salmon and cigars. China noticed that the US side had threatened to impose additional tariffs should China take retaliatory measures. This logic of a typical bully won't make China flinch. China is ready to take corresponding measures. In this day and age, launching a trade war is outdated and backward which begets popular antipathy. Earlier this year, the Trump administration had unilaterally imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, sparking strong opposition even from its major trading partners. With its closest allies rejecting the protectionism, can the United States really afford to go it alone? Reciprocal tariffs are always the last resort. But if Washington is unable to stop its capriciousness which costs the interests of people of both countries, reciprocal tariffs are the leverage China has no choice but to use."
0,"China should scrap all height requirements for teachers in order to end discrimination and promote fairness in employment, experts said, after a woman in Northwest China was denied her teaching credentials because she was too short. Xiong Bingqi, deputy director of the 21st Century Education Research Institute in Beijing, said the country should have unified standards and stop allowing provinces to make their own rules. There is no reason that some provinces should have height requirements while others don't, and the practice might lead to abuses such as bribery, he said. Cnwest.com reported on Wednesday that the teacher candidate, a recent graduate who is 1.4 meters tall and identified only by her surname Li, was told she had failed the accrediting test after a medical examination in June. Female applicants should be at least 1.5 meters tall, and males 1.55 meters to qualify as teachers in Shaanxi, according to the local education department. Huang Huairong, an education professor at Beijing Normal University, said there is no requirement in the Teacher's Law preventing short people from becoming teachers, and height has nothing to do with whether someone is qualified. ""My four years of college will be for nothing and I may even breach the agreement with the school if I cannot get the teaching credentials,"" Li was quoted as saying. She was admitted as an English major at Shaanxi Normal University in 2014. As a government-funded student, Li paid no tuition, but is required to teach at local schools after graduation. ""The university should have informed me four years ago when I was admitted,"" Li was quoted as saying. ""The university is just doing what it has been told to do,"" a spokesperson for Shaanxi Normal University told the website. ""We don't make the rules. We follow the instructions of the Shaanxi Education Department."" An official surnamed Yang from the education department told the website it will deal with the case appropriately, and it plans to drop the requirement next year. Shaanxi would be the latest province to remove the height requirement for teachers, following others such as Sichuan and Jiangxi. The Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region also eliminated the rule."

It is the third year in a row that the Hebei Vocational Art School has recruited students at the Duancun School in Duancun town of Anxin county, Hebei province, a seemingly unreachable dream before a ballet course was opened at the school. Jiaojiao is one of the girls practicing ballet under the guidance of Guan Yu, a professor from the Beijing Dance Academy.,At the invitation of an art charity, Guan started a ballet course at Duancun School in 2012 to offer rural children a chance to appreciate the artistic dance form. ""I hope art can be a part of their lives. I want them to be able to understand   whether they are a farmer or entrepreneur in the future,"" said Guan. His efforts were met with a cold shoulder at the beginning. Guan's ideal was considered too unpractical in the eyes of the students' parents. Many still believed that pursuing academic study and going to an academic college would be a better option for their children.,Guan had to persuade parents one by one to send their children to the ballet course. To show them the benefits of practicing ballet, Guan took his students to perform in prestigious schools and famous opera houses in Beijing. Guan believes the sense of honor that comes with the performances gradually changed the parents' attitudes. Seeing some students successfully admitted to arts colleges has also played a role in changing parents' minds.,In 2016, two students from the ballet course were admitted to the provincial art vocational school, which encouraged more parents to register their children in the course. Despite the fierce competition for a place in these arts schools, Guan said the ballet course provides an alternative for rural children in receiving higher education."
0,"Inspired by a scene in a Soviet film that showed cattle and sheep roaming on a prairie under a blue sky and white clouds, He Jingrong, from Beijing, decided to specialize in caring for livestock when she went to university. ""I thought what a nice job it would be,"" said He, an 80-something retiree who was a senior vet at China Agricultural University Veterinary Teaching Hospital in Beijing's Haidian district. She enrolled at China Agricultural University to study Western veterinary science in 1958. Two years later, after the government decided to strengthen efforts to protect folk veterinary medicine, she was among the first group of students selected to major in a newly established traditional Chinese veterinary medicine course at the university. At that time, over 80,000 of the 90,000 vets in China lived and worked in the countryside. Without any textbooks, He and 13 other students went to the countryside to learn from veteran vets' practical experience in treating sick animals. The knowledge passed down included things like heating the sole of a shoe and applying it to heal a rectal prolapse, and using an 8-year-old boy's urine as an ingredient to enhance the efficacy of a dose of medicine. After graduation, the 14 vets were assigned to 14 different provinces. He was sent to eastern China's Shandong province, where she had a hard time as she had to jump into sties to treat pigs and hurry around to treat an average of 50 patients a day. Being a vet is a risky career, as He can attest. Two vets she knew died after they were kicked by horses. One was kicked in the stomach and ruptured a kidney when examining a horse's forelegs. One classmate decided to switch careers soon after graduation when a buffalo horn scarred her face while she was performing acupuncture on the animal's hind legs. A dog bit off a doctor's nose and He, who returned to Beijing in 1970, had to have three rabies shots after being bitten by animals. ""Everybody looked down on us then,"" she said. ""My family would complain I had wasted five years in college, and that it would have been better to become a laborer."" However, she said the status of vets has been greatly boosted in recent years. ""Now people say it is a career to make money,"" He said."

Heads and teaching staff from all of the capital's kindergartens are required to complete 30 hours of training, which includes an eight-hour face-to-face component and 22 hours of online courses, according to the Beijing Municipal Education Commission on Friday. The training covers the management team and teachers from kindergartens of all kinds, including private and public schools. Li Yi, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Education Commission, said it is important to raise the recruitment levels for teachers at preschools to build a solid faculty, to offer training that enhances teaching capacity, as well as to provide better packages that attract more talent to a preschool teaching career. Starting from late June, the kindergarten teacher training has lasted four months, with 200 classes designed for kindergarten principals, teachers and child care workers. More than 3,000 kindergarten principals took part in the training."
0,"New exhibition detailing the depiction of the creature in currency over the ages explores their transition from spiritual totem to national symbol. Wang Kaihao reports. When asked where is the most common place to see images of Chinese dragons, most people would probably guess it was the Palace Museum in Beijing. However, the answer is actually much more down-to-earth－on currency notes. An exhibition at Beijing's Deshengmen Archery Tower that opened on Friday aims to give people the bigger picture of how dragons have been depicted on currency throughout Chinese history. At  currency exhibits have gone on display, demonstrating the origins of this animal deity, delving into its auspicious meanings through the ages, and showing the dragon grew to become ancient China's imperial symbol.,  ""Dragon are generally considered to be a spiritual totem for Chinese people,"" Song Zhenhong, deputy director of the Beijing administration of cultural heritage, said at the opening ceremony of the exhibition. ""It has also been a crucial element in the design of the Chinese currency,"" she says. According to Song, images of dragons have been a permanent theme in Chinese currency since the Han Dynasty (202 BC-220 AD). ""Currency requires a rigid format, but it also greatly reflects the characteristics of their time,"" Song explains. ""Money has developed into the most prominent platform for promoting the culture surrounding the Chinese dragon."" She adds that banknotes and coins bearing Chinese dragons continued to reflect the diverse shifts in China's political, cultural and social environments over the centuries. ""During China's imperial years, dragon images were depicted in a more solemn manner when it came to representing the royal family,"" says Li Zhidong, curator of the exhibition and a board member of the Beijing Numismatic Society. ""However, when they were printed on bank notes, they began to reflect an interesting mixture of royal majesty and people's everyday lives."" Li says the use of dragon images on currency reached its peak in the late Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), and many exhibits are taken from this period.,  In ancient China, a type of coin called yashengqian (money to suppress vicious spirits), was also used to convey good wishes in rituals rather than being used as a form of currency－and dragon images are found on these in abundance. ""Compared with the rigid format used in currency, we can see a much greater variety of dragon patterns and designs on these coins,"" Li explains. ""They added new colors to Chinese numismatic culture and grew from depictions seen only in royal livery to later become a symbol for the country as a whole."" Consequently, the use of dragons has continued to be a common theme in currency long after the fall of the Chinese monarchy, and some of the exhibits are commemorative coins from contemporary times. At the same time, the depiction of dragon has not just been limited to Chinese currency or the courtyards of the Forbidden City. Images of dragons also appeared frequently on foreign currency throughout ancient times, especially in neighboring countries influenced by Chinese culture like Vietnam and on the Korean Peninsula.,  Countries like Australia and Palau have also released commemorative coins to mark the most recent Year of the Dragon in 2012, and a special section for these has been set up at the exhibition. ""When you look at the use of dragon totems in currency through the ages, the exhibition actually reflects all the changes witnessed in Chinese society,"" Wang Peiwu, director of the Beijing Ancient Numismatic Exhibition Hall, says. ""But now dragon has taken on a new meaning: It represents a revival of Chinese civilization in the modern world.""

1,"BEIJING - Beijing plans to cut its coal consumption to below 4.2 million tons, down 13.4 percent from 2017, according to Beijing Municipal Commission of City Management. The goal is expected to be met by shifting focus from cutting consumption in the city to promoting clean energy use in the rural areas. Under the plan, Beijing will complete replacing coal with clean energy in 450 rural villages by the end of 2018, the commission said. The city will also use clean energy to power more boilers used for winter heating, as well as shutting down more coal-burning industrial plants. Beijing announced a plan to cut coal consumption in 2013. The city has since then cut more than 18 million tons of coal consumption. In 2017, the city burned 4.85 million tons of coal, accounting for 5.6 percent of its total energy consumption. Coal burning is no longer a major source of PM2.5 - particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometres in diameter - in Beijing, according to a study published last month by the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau. The PM2.5 level in Beijing has dropped to its lowest since 2013 when the national air pollution control campaign began."
0,"Ten years ago, Beijing-based artist Tai Xiangzhou was pursuing a doctoral degree in painting at Tsinghua University. He visited the sixth-century Longxing Temple in Zhengding, Hebei province, with his friend Hang Kan, a professor and director of Peking University's School of Archaeology and Museology. There they saw a revolving wood repository that measures 2 meters in diameter.  Hang told him that centuries ago, monks used the repository as a library where they kept and retrieved sutras. He was inspired to create an installation of similar structure in 2010, called Gateway of Expedient Means.  Tai has placed it at the entrance of his ongoing solo exhibition at Beijing's Ink Studio. He says he hopes it not only reminds people of the importance of knowledge and extensive reading - it directs viewers' attention to Chinese cultural traditions' worldviews.  He says the work shows a correspondence between heaven and Earth pervasive in classic Chinese architecture: The top dougong (interlocking brackets) structure connects people with the heavenly world, and the part beneath indicates the human world.  Tai puts dozens of books inside the revolving installation like the monks did. However, they are empty books. Tai hopes visitors can write down their feelings about the work and their ideas about the universe.  The relationship between people and the cosmos is the core idea of Tai's current exhibition titled Speculative Cosmologies. Besides the installation Gateway of Expedient Means, he also shows dozens of ink-brush paintings, which shows his exploration with the age-old genre depicting mountains and water over the decade.  In these works, Tai presents an academic depth that he accumulated through continuous studies of Song Dynasty (960-1279) masterpieces. ""When I encounter obstacles while creating, I always turn to the Song predecessors for answers. They are my art professors,"" he says.  He also incorporates his understandings of the latest scientific discoveries of the universe - for example, his impressions of meteors and astronomical images.  He says new discoveries about the cosmos and the remaining secrets of the universe should be blended into ink artists' creations, because Chinese ink art has long essentially been an expression of how people view the world and deal with it properly.  Tai says his early worldview was formed in the spacious and extensive environment of Yinchuan, capital of the Ningxia Hui autonomous region, where he grew up.  Yinchuan sits on the banks of the Yellow River. Tai says it took him only 20 minutes to reach the river bank by bicycle, and he often played in the nearby Tenggeli and Maowusu deserts that surround Yinchuan.  ""The wilderness makes people feel closer to nature. Meanwhile, we understand that we are a part of nature and the universe, and we keep gaining power from them,"" he says.  He says the discussion of the relationship between people and the world is not exclusive to Chinese cultural traditions but a universal topic. He says that when he creates based on people's renewed understandings of the universe, he feels that his works can be appreciated by more viewers.  ""Artists present the most beautiful images to express their awe for nature, the creator of human beings. When he maintains the same respect, his art can resonate with more people."""

His remarks were made on Thursday.  To break popular rumors about food safety circulating on the internet in recent years – such as fruits are dyed to look better or watermelons are injected with water to gain their weight – Chen said he conducted several experiments in a booth at the China International Exhibition Center in Beijing, which was broadcast live on social media platforms, including Weibo.  Luo Yunbo, a professor in food sciences at the China Agricultural University in Beijing, said there were many reasons behind the food safety rumors in China, with some people even making rumors against certain types of food to seek profit.  ""The rapid development of social media contributed to spread of such rumors, which can seriously mislead consumers and cause damage to certain sectors,"" he said.  Police in Jinjiang, Fujian province, have detained 18 people since February suspected of producing and spreading rumors about  a type of seaweed product popular in many parts of China, who've stated some companies have made the product out of plastic.

0,"The size of transregional chain organizations specializing in early childhood education and care should be limited for better management and regulation, according to members of China's top political advisory body. ""Unlike running a chain of McDonald's restaurants, the risks of running a chain of kindergartens are way too high,"" said Ni Minjing, deputy director of the Shanghai Municipal Education Commission and a member of the 13th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. ""I don't suggest using a commercial model to provide preschool education through a chain of kindergartens because it's unavoidable for administration problems to occur at some kindergartens owned by an education group that has hundreds of kindergartens nationwide, and the problems often cause a ripple effect,"" Ni said on the sidelines of this year's session of the CPPCC National Committee. His views were shared by Liu Ru, head of the Beijing Beihai Kindergarten and a member of the CPPCC National Committee, who said education groups operating a chain of kindergartens are ""too big to manage"" and their size should be limited. ""Even if the founders of an education group have great ideas on what kind of kindergartens they want to run, it's still hard for the management team of each kindergarten to carry out the ideas,"" Liu said. ""The devil is in the details. The founders cannot detect certain problems if they do not visit classes to observe children's activities and talk to the children, as well as the teachers and managers,"" she said. In addition, the huge size of transregional education groups also increases the difficulty for government regulation, Ni said. ""The operation of kindergartens is closely related to the culture and resources in a particular city, county or town. Therefore, if the investors controlling an education group that has gotten the regulatory nod for the opening of a kindergarten in Beijing want to open another in Shanghai, they should go through the same procedures of application for regulatory approval once again, rather than simplified procedures with lower requirements,"" he said. During the last 10 years, the number of kindergartens has more than doubled in China, and the kindergarten enrollment rate increased from around 30 percent to nearly 80 percent. Private kindergartens played an important part of the growth process. Without them, it would have been impossible for China to achieve such a high preschool enrollment rate within such a short time, he said. ""Industrialization of preschool education helped us find a solution for inadequate supply of public kindergartens. However, now we're seeing signs of overindustrialization,"" he said. ""A growing number of parents become increasingly aware of the importance of preschool education, whereas government resources cannot meet the rising demand. Private capital has taken the opportunity, with an excessive amount of money invested in this market segment."" He said those who want to make a huge profit should not invest in preschool education because the majority of kindergartens should be nonprofit. ""If a private kindergarten has a strong profit target, it will cut teachers' salaries and benefits as much as possible to reduce costs. This will cause many education problems,"" he said. In spite of the professional training they received, the majority of kindergarten teachers are paid much less than nannies. The average salary of teachers at private kindergartens range from 1,500 to 3,000 yuan ($237 to $474) per month nationwide, while the typical monthly salary for a nanny who lives with the employer is about 6,000 yuan in first-tier cities such as Beijing. Liu of the Beijing Beihai Kindergarten said the government ""should increase investment in preschool education, especially the investment in selection of better teaching staff, to make kindergarten teachers feel proud of their job and motivate them with great compensation packages""."

Yu Jianhua, deputy director of the the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Ecology and Environment, said the city will work to cut annual and three-year average concentrations of PM 2.5, as well as improve water and soil quality to meet standards set for 2020 in a national plan. The latest data shows average concentration of PM2.5 - hazardous fine particles with a diameter less than 2.5 microns - has dropped to 51 micrograms per cubic meter in 2018, down 12.1 percent on a year-on-year basis. The average level of PM2.5 will continue to decline in 2019, Yu said. In 2019, the capital will phase out 300 manufacturing and pollution-intensive enterprises, and gradually replace diesel-powered vehicles with new energy ones, he said. According to data released by the bureau, vehicle exhaust emissions have been the major source of PM2.5, accounting for 45 percent of the total. In July 2018, the State Council released a three-year action plan to curb air pollution by 2020, aiming for 80 percent of days in major cities to have good air quality by 2020 on average, and the average PM2.5 concentration is expected to decrease by 18 percent from the level in 2015."

The competition received more than 900 submissions from 11 Dulwich College International colleges and high schools, including entries from the founding school in London. Wild animals, plants and people were all the subjects featured in the submissions. Some young competitors don't have high tech cameras, yet were still able to capture beauty just the same.,Lauren Z, 14 and a student from Dulwich College Beijing, shot a view of Yulong Snow Mountain with her smart phone. Her work is a palette of blue and green, the essential shades of Mother Nature. ""I took this photo when my family traveled to Yunnan province last year.

When asked if she ever highlighted the colors with digital tools, the young girl said the natural view is beautiful enough and the photo didn't need any polish. Compared to most of her peers in China, Lauren has more time to develop her interests due to the freedom and high-quality educational resources provided by the school.,The students' horizons were also largely broadened by social projects from the school.

The 12-year-old boy, in grey shorts and a white shirt, is fluent in both Chinese and English. Born in Australia, he came to China at the age of 3 and has studied at Dulwich College Beijing for almost 10 years. Titled  his work features two children looking up into the sky with watery eyes. In black and white, the light and shade poetically highlight the sorrow and sadness of the two children as they wait for something. Another submission from the student also showed his natural gift for photography. He captured the light on frozen ice and named it  . With only two colors, black and gold, the shooting has a happy, festive air as the warm light shimmers opaquely.,Zheng H., one of the winners, presented a photo featuring a lighthouse on the Pearl River in Guangdong province. The work not only shows the contrasting beauty of blue and white, but also neat and clean concentric circles made by the lighthouse and its base. The 18-year-old student gave the photo a meaningful name —  . As the note on the photo says, ""The sea is not the end, it is the beginning of adventure. The lighthouse, the origin, the destination."" This kind of spirit is one of the traits that Dulwich College International tries to cultivate in their students through art and music education.,According to Simon Herbert, headmaster at Dulwich College Beijing, art is a part of the curriculum and a compulsory lesson for students aged 2 to 14. At 15, such lessons are optional, yet students are still encouraged by the school to continue learning art, music or drama, including performing and visual arts. ""We have a good number of students that take (art lessons) all the way through the age of 18. The art department is one of my favorites,"" Herbert said. Art pieces from the students were hung on the wall of Smile Angel Children's Hospital in Beijing. The theme for these works is ""miracles"", highlighting children's hopes and dreams. Herbert believes art education is essential during childhood, and this is the reason why the school makes it compulsory. ""Art is another window to the world. Art, music, drama and language are other ways to look at things. If you don't teach students such things, they will have no opportunity to think about the world creatively or in a different way."" Herbert added. In art education, the school works to encourage and protect each child's originality. ""We hope the students have the ability to find beauty in this world. Only when they have a spirit and mind to feel the beauty, can their works impress others,"" said Jing Yao, school development director at Dulwich College Beijing.,The submissions leave a strong impression on viewers, including the founder of Holiland, Luo Hong, an experienced photographer and the ambassador for this year's competition. Luo came to the Dulwich Science Art Photo Competition award ceremony after a month of shooting in Chile, and was amazed by the children's photography. ""From these excellent works, I can see the effort made by Dulwich College International in children's education. There are many differences between the way children and adults take photos. An adult may take a photo from a very serious and professional perspective, yet children will not do such things. But the young people's ability to capture beauty is as strong as the adults,"" Luo told China Daily website.,Luo himself fell in love with photography at an early age. ""I was overwhelmed by the camera, which can transform an instant to an eternity,"" Luo said. Though Luo studied photography at first, his passion for beautiful things encouraged him to make cakes that were works of art, as he couldn't find one he liked when celebrating his mother's birthday. Holiland, China's leading bakery, was then founded on this simple and pure wish. Due to the passion of its founder, the brand has produced many exquisite cakes as beautiful as art. The business didn't stop Luo from becoming a professional photographer. He went to Africa to shoot 45 times, encountering many dangers and almost losing his life in a serious helicopter accident.,However, he escaped death and lived more confidently after the accident. Luo became the first Chinese person to hold a solo nature photo exhibition at the New York headquarters of the United Nations. He also established an art museum in the Shunyi district in Beijing. The museum, surrounded by a lake with black swans and mist, looks like an image directly out of a fairy tale. The colorful flowers are planted in a poetic way, as if they grew up naturally in the wild, rather than being nurtured by men. ""I once saw a similarly beautiful view in nature, and I asked the designer to replicate it at the museum,"" Luo said. Soon he will go to Africa again to capture even more of nature's beauty. ""My sons are taking care of the business now. They said I was given a pair of eyes to capture beautiful things. So I will go on taking photos,"" Luo added, smiling. Christian Guertler, CEO of Dulwich College International, praised Luo as a great example for students. ""First, he is a successful entrepreneur, and I wish all of our students are able to become as successful as he has. Second, he is a designer - if you look around here (the museum), there are a lot of his inspirations,"" Guertler said."

Wang graduated from the department of Physics in Tsinghua University in 1940 and went abroad to study Applied Optics in Britain, where he got his master's degree. In 1942, he became the assistant researcher of Birmingham Company of Britain. He came back to China in 1948. Wang made outstanding contributions to developing China's precision optical instruments, including the country's first electronic microscope and first laser device. His endeavor in developing China's laser-triggered nuclear fusion technology earned him the Distinguished Medal for China's atomic bomb, hydrogen bomb and man-made satellite projects. The scientist's expertise in optics also helped build the crystal coffin of late Chairman  which was installed at the Chairman Mao Memorial Hall in Beijing. Wang also contributed to proposing China's 863 Program, a program funded by the central government to develop advanced technologies for the country's major construction projects and national defense. Wang was an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Engineering, and International Academy of Astronautics. Wang died on July 21, 2011 at the age of 96 in Beijing."
0,"The Beijing municipal government is taking efforts to build a safe, convenient, efficient, green and economic transportation system.  Attaching great importance to solving traffic jams, the capital aims to improve citizens' satisfaction, according to Zhou Zhengyu, the director of the Beijing Municipal Commission of Transport.  Beijing has introduced controls on its population size, transferred some function of capital, optimized the jobhousing balance and reduced commuting distances in order to ease traffic pressure in the last five years, Zhou said.  The municipal government has made financing plans for railways, urban roads and highways, with investment in transportation infrastructure totaling 340 billion yuan ($49.8 billion) between 2012 and 2016. This accounted for 13 percent of fixed-asset investment in Beijing in the period. Public transportation investment accounts for 75 percent of Beijing's total transportation infrastructure investment.  With the support of investment, the capital has accelerated the construction of transportation infrastructure to upgrade capacity.  The length of the urban rail network increased from 372 kilometers to 574 km from 2012 to 2016. During the same period, the city's road length increased from 6,258 km to 6,374 km, with highways extending from 912 km to 1,014 km and bus lanes increasing from 604 km to 845 km.  Green commuting - traveling by bike or public transport - is becoming increasingly popular, according to BMCT.  The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei coordinated development strategy is promoting traffic integration, according to Zhou.  The Beijing-Zhangjiakou high-speed railway is a key project for solving the problem of northwest commuting and enhancing the integration of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei, Zhou added.  It will promote coordinated development and support Winter Olympic traffic, because roads linking Beijing and Zhangjiakou - the two co-hosts of the 2022 Winter Olympics - play a major role in transportation between the two cities.  Construction of the Beijing-Bazhou high-speed railway, a key link for the capital's new airport and Xiongan New Area, Hebei province, is planned to kick off in 2020.  The 698-km Beijing-Shenyang high-speed railway starts at Xinghuo Railway Station in Beijing and connects Chengde in Hebei province with Chaoyang and Fuxing in Liaoning province, before eventually reaching Shenyang.  In addition, the one-card-pass project of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei province, covering 1,011 downtown bus routes and 122 suburb bus routes, makes traffic integration more effective, according to officials.  The Beijing-Kunming Highway, national road 111, Beijing-Taipei expressway and other projects have been put into use, accelerating the connectivity of the regional road network, Zhou said.  These projects will help to relieve the strain on Beijing's non-capital functions to promote the adjustment of the city layout and spacial structure, and to build a modern transportation network with low cost and huge capacity, according to a senior municipal official.  Priority will be given to public transport, which can improve green travel efficiently. Around 850 km of bus lanes, four Bus Rapid Transit lines and 140 direct lines will form a metro-bus public transit system in Beijing, Zhou said."
1,"Total soybean exports from the United States to China would fall at least 20 percent for the 2017-18 marketing year, compared to a historic record of 36 million metric tons last marketing year, if the trade dispute between China and US cannot be solved in a timely manner. Zhang Xiaoping, country director for China at the US Soybean Export Council, said current trade tensions have already pushed Chinese importers to turn elsewhere for soybean supplies, although US soybeans are competitive in both price and quality. ""US farmers believe the right strategy to solve trade imbalances should be to further expand trade instead of restrictive measures such as punitive tariffs. So they have been making an effort to support all policies aimed at expanding trade,"" he said. As the US is expected to increase its sales of soybean and soy products to other markets, total US soybean exports for this year would decrease only by 5 percent, according to the USSEC. ""Because soybean trade between China and the US has been beneficial to Chinese crushers, feed millers, animal producers and US farmers, any trade restrictions will damage the industries in both countries. We don’t think it reasonable or worthwhile for any policies to hurt ones' own interests,"" Zhang said. He added soybean trade between the two countries will be further expanded in the long run, and expanding soy trade can effectively help solve the trade imbalance issue in the short run. ""We hope the two countries will realize the importance of soybean trade to both economies and find the solution to the current trade dispute."" China has other options to seek new soybean sellers from other markets such as Brazil and Argentina, although the US holds some advantages when it comes to price and sophisticated distribution systems for delivery. ""US soybeans are of decent quality in terms of digestible amino acids for better animal performance and more efficient animal production, which makes the US a competitive supplier of soybeans,"" said Li Hanping, a professor at Shenyang Agricultural University in Liaoning province. Soybeans are grown in 29 states in the US, where about 55 percent of its soybean production is exported. Chinese farmers currently plant non-genetically modified varieties, and their per-hectare production is about half that of genetically modified ones grown in the US, Brazil and Argentina. It is difficult to increase China's soybean output within a short period, because farmers in the Northeast cannot get more land or convert land grown for other yields such as corn and rice. ""With rising farming equipment prices and limited arable land, the cost of raising domestic output is fairly high,"" said Ding Lixin, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences in Beijing."
0,"A child from a poverty-stricken, mountainous part of southwestern China who gained online fame last year as the ""snowflake boy"" has moved into a new house and is embracing a new life. Wang Fuman, from rural Ludian, Yunnan province, attracted nationwide attention a year ago after photos showing his ice-covered hair after a walk to school went viral online. Fuman, 9, and his family moved into a new house in June, and he is now living with his elder sister, mother and an ailing grandmother. His father, Wang Gangkui, works at a construction site in Kunming, the provincial capital. The family received donations from all over the country after Fuman became an internet sensation. He and his sister visited Beijing last winter at the invitation of People's Public Security University of China, with the trip organized by China Construction Third Engineering Bureau. Even though family members underwent trials last year, Wang said his son hasn't been too much affected. ""Fuman performs well in school and is currently preparing for his final exam,"" Wang said. ""His classmates are all treating him as well as usual."" The many firsts Fuman experienced last year included being an internet sensation, flying in an airplane, going to the national capital and appearing on television. Before his fame, Fuman dreamed of becoming a policeman. After seeing the differences between a big city and his mountain home, he still has that ambition. ""I appreciate those warmhearted people who helped us,"" the Grade 4 student said. ""I will study hard and go out of the mountains on my own to repay them."" His father added: ""I contact him and other family members every week by phone, and he also shares his school life with me. Fuman and his sister often talk about how wonderful Beijing is, so I still need to work harder to offer my children a good life, even though many warmhearted people have given us a lot of help."" Kunming is more than 400 kilometers from Ludian, and Wang returned home only three times last year. His next visit is scheduled for next month's Spring Festival. The new house has left the family several tens of thousands of yuan in debt, but Wang said it will be paid off in two years to three years. He now earns 3,000 to 4,000 yuan ($440 to $585) a month, in a job that China Construction Third Engineering Bureau helped him find. Concerned that the contrast between his hometown and the outside world would affect Fuman, teachers at Zhuanshanbao Primary School gave him special guidance after his return from Beijing, deputy headmaster Fu Heng told people.cn. Heating equipment was installed last year in the school's classrooms and new dormitories, with the help of the local government and outside donations. Fuman and more than 70 other students stay in the new dormitories four nights a week to avoid early morning walks to school in freezing temperatures. ""My son goes to school every Monday, and leaves school on Friday,"" Wang said. ""The school also covers his living expenses, so I feel reassured about his school life."" Fu said society's warm response had let the students experience the beauty of the world, and many now want to venture out of the mountains. ""The seed of a dream has been planted,"" he said. ""We have full expectations for the future."""

1,"China will develop a new area in the northern region parallel to the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone in the south and the Shanghai Pudong New Area in the east to serve as another economic engine and advance the coordinated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. The establishment of the Xiongan New Area in Hebei province is a ""major historic and strategic choice made by the Communist Party of China Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core,"" said a circular issued by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on Saturday. ""It (the decision to set up the new area) is a strategy crucial for a millennium to come,"" the circular said. The area, about 100 km southwest of downtown Beijing, will span three counties that sit at the center of the triangular area formed by Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei's provincial capital Shijiazhuang. The area features geological advantages, convenient transportation, an excellent ecological environment, ample resources and lots of room for development, according to the circular. The move will help phase out functions from Beijing that are not related to the capital, explore a new model of optimized development in densely populated areas and restructure the urban layout in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, the circular said. President Xi, who is also general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, has said that priority should be given to developing an area to pool noncapital functions that will be shifted from Beijing. He has ordered that a modern urban district be built at a suitable location in Hebei, guided by new development concepts. During an inspection tour to Hebei on Feb 23, Xi called for ""world vision, international standards, Chinese characteristics and high goals"" in the planning and construction of the new area. He called for efforts to build Xiongan into ""a demonstration area for innovative development"". The area should prioritize ecological protection and improve people's well-being as well as protect and carry forward Chinese traditional culture, he said. Zhao Kezhi, Party chief of Hebei, said on Saturday that the development of such a new area is a historic project that will push forward the integration of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and accelerate the social and economic growth of Hebei. Zhao required careful planning of the area. ""Construction should not begin until every inch of the area is clearly planned,"" he told senior officials in Hebei. Experts said that the new area bears the double task of becoming a growth pole in northern China and helping cure severe ""urban ills"", such as traffic congestion and air pollution in Beijing. ""The new area, together with Beijing and Tianjin, will form a world-class city cluster, and drive the entire economic growth in northern China,"" said Xing Tianhe, head of the Urban Planning Association of Hebei. He said the area, which is now comparatively less developed, offers plenty of room for urban planning and construction. The area is also home to Baiyangdian, northern China's largest freshwater wetland, so it boasts sound environment conditions. Li Guoping, head of Peking University's Beijing Development Institute, said the new area will be the place where Beijing's noncapital functions will be redistributed to. China Daily — Xinhua"
0,"The China Association of Performing Arts Committee has launched a branch that will be dedicated to traditional Chinese opera. About 30 troupes from around the country, including the National Peking Opera Company, the Northern Kunqu Opera Theater and Xi'an Qinqiang Opera Company, recently gathered in Beijing to mark the setting up of the China Association of Performing Arts Committee of Chinese Opera with the aim of reviving public interest in the old art form. According to Zhu Kening, president of the China Association of Performing Arts, the new body will focus on promoting traditional Chinese opera in new ways－making the art form accessible to audiences through the internet, offering such platforms as conferences and forums for the troupes to communicate and providing better theater management. There are about 400 types of traditional Chinese opera. Most of them have been listed as national intangible cultural heritage. ""Despite government efforts, such old art forms can't be popularized unless the opera troupes explore new ways to add a contemporary touch,"" says Zhu. ""Technology,－for example, livestreaming－can help in this regard."" Before contemporary entertainment like cinema, television and computer games became popular in the country, Chinese audiences went to theaters to watch traditional opera shows. The culture of each region, such as dialect, gave birth to a variety of traditional operas. ""The new committee will bring artists of different Chinese operas together annually to share ideas about getting into the cultural mainstream,"" says Zhu.,One of the new committee's initiators is Lyu Guliang, a media guru who launched his company, We Play (Beijing) Cultural Industry Investment and Management Ltd, two years ago. His company has taken Chinese opera artists to perform abroad. ""Traditional Chinese opera is a vibrant and centuries-old tradition that showcases the essence of Chinese culture. But it is losing in the market because the way entertainment is consumed has changed. We are trying to change that idea,"" says Lyu. Lyu's company has produced promotional videos, starring pop stars and Chinese opera artists. The first video, which went online on Wednesday, features pop icon Lu Han and Peking Opera actress Yuan Huiqin. Lyu says a series of live performances will be held and traditional opera films shown in Beijing throughout next year. ""If you look at the past 10 years in the development of traditional opera troupes, we have experienced a good time,"" says Li Jianshu, director of Yuju Opera Company of Henan province. There are 164 government-supported Yuju Opera troupes and 1,437 private troupes in Henan, he says. About two years ago, Li initiated the idea of gathering those troupes together annually to share new productions and ideas about developing Yuju Opera. He says the internet is the main force for interacting and connecting with audiences. The fourth Yuju Opera Festival, which was held at Henan Poly Art Center in August, attracted more than 500 million viewers online. Promoting Chinese culture and boosting confidence in it were outlined by President Xi Jinping in his report to the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in October."

Calling the AU a banner of unity and strength, Xi said that since last year, under the leadership of AU, African integration process has made significant progress, African countries have continued to speak in one voice on major international and regional issues and Africa's global influence has increasingly grown. ""I warmly congratulate the AU on the progress and sincerely wish that it will continue to unite and lead African countries towards new and greater achievements,"" Xi said. Xi stressed that in September last year, the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) was a huge success, during which he joined hands with leaders of the African countries and the AU to draw a blueprint for the development of China-Africa relations. China is willing to work with Africa to implement the FOCAC Beijing Summit outcomes, promoting the alignment of the joint construction of the Belt and Road with the implementation of the AU Agenda 2063, the UN 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda as well as other development strategies of African countries, Xi said. By doing so, the two sides will build a closer China-Africa community to contribute more to the building of a community with a shared future for mankind, Xi added."

The 3-kilogram CubeSat, named Young Pioneer I, was launched atop a Long March 2D carrier rocket from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwestern China along with six other satellites. The miniature spacecraft has a designed life span of a year in a sun-synchronous orbit and when its batteries are expended, it will burn up on re-entry into the atmosphere, said Xie Tao, founder and CEO of Commsat. He said the satellite has equipment to take pictures and allow students access to long distance communication technology. The satellite was part of the China Youngster Minisatellite Project initiated by the China Soong Ching Ling Foundation, China Association for Science and Technology and the Chinese Society of Education. The project aims to popularize astronomical sciences among youth. To help students study astronomy and track the minisatellite, a main ground station was built at the China Soong Ching Ling Science and Culture Center for Young People in Beijing. Some 10 substations have been established in schools across the country, including Beijing No 4 High School and Wenchang Middle School in Wenchang, Hainan province - seat of China's southernmost satellite launch center, the company said. All the ground stations, converted from science labs, are managed by teachers who received training from the company. Schools pay for the training sessions for teachers and students, station equipment and teaching aids such as actual size CubeSat models, it said. The minisatellite also carries commercial projects, such as testing technology in space. Peng Yuanyuan, co-founder and chief operating officer of Commsat, said schools with such ground stations can offer courses that popularize knowledge about satellite tracking and control. ""The course could stimulate students' interest,"" she said. Tan Lichuan, who teaches sciences at Wenchang Middle School, said the program also fosters students' ability to figure things out for themselves and promotes a positive perception of engineering. ""It supplements classroom education and offers them more learning opportunities,"" he said. In 2016, Bayi Youngsters 'Expedition - Chinese teenagers' first satellite - was developed by Beijing's Bayi School with help from scientists."

0,"China is developing driverless high-speed trains which could be used on the Beijing-Zhangjiakou railway line, under construction for the Beijing Winter Olympics in 2022, the chief engineer of the country's railway operator said. The development of the country's high-speed trains is toward smart driverless ones, said He Huawu, chief engineer State-owned China Railway Corp, at a railway exhibition in Shanghai on Thursday. He said China has developed into a leading player in high-speed railways worldwide, and he has noticed ""drivers are very nervous while driving high-speed trains, because of the safety concern."" Therefore, smart driverless high-speed trains have been on the agenda, He said, and the change will make travels much safer and arrive on time more frequently. People might hold concerns about the safety of the driverless high-speed trains running hundreds of kilometers in much more complex environments than subway trains, which only run tens of kilometers, He said. One solution is to ensure the train is mainly controlled by a smart machine, but with a driver still on duty, He said. The next step of the country's high-speed railway development is to employ smart driverless high-speed trains, He said. Researchers are verifying the possibility of driverless trains on the high-speed railway from Beijing to Zhangjiakou, He said, striving to run such trains during the Beijing Winter Olympics in 2022. Being more economical, efficient, sustainable, greener and safer are the keys to China's future railway development, He said. In September, China has made use of subway train driverless technology on the 16.6-km Yanfang Line in Beijing, the Chinese mainland's first driverless subway made domestically."
1,"World attention is being drawn to the possibility of a meeting of representatives from the world's two largest economies at the World Economic Forum annual meeting at Davos, Switzerland next week. With concerns over trade protectionism and anti-globalization swirling, there are signs that the Chinese delegation could meet on the sidelines with the transition team of US president-elect Donald Trump. Such a meeting could help narrow positions on trade and sensitive political issues, observers said. Uncertainty over those positions has rocked Asia-Pacific nations that would be the most affected by a trade war or a security conflict, they said. President Xi Jinping will lead the Chinese delegation to Switzerland for a state visit from Sunday to Wednesday. On Tuesday, he will become the first top Chinese leader to attend the Davos meeting. Given that Trump will take office on Jan 20, ""someone from the transition team representing the new administration"" will attend the forum, Klaus Schwab, forum executive chairman, said on Tuesday. It remains unclear who that would be. Asked whether a Trump representative would meet with the Chinese delegation at Davos, Vice-Foreign Minister Li Baodong said on Wednesday at a news briefing on Xi's trip that ""there are open channels of communication"" between Beijing and Trump's team. Beijing is willing to arrange meetings with various parties if time permits on the sidelines of the Davos forum, so ""the relevant two-way meetings are being discussed"", Li said, without directly confirming a meeting with the Trump team. Also on Wednesday, Vice-Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin said Beijing hopes that ""the US respects China's interests and concerns in the Asia-Pacific region"", adding that China is ""willing to maintain contacts with the new US administration over Asia-Pacific affairs and discuss cooperation"". Security in the Asia-Pacific cannot be maintained by the US alone as it requires joint efforts by all countries, particularly the major countries, Liu said at a news conference. Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University of China in Beijing, said if the Davos meeting happens, Trump's envoy might press Beijing on financial issues and the Taiwan question. Zhong Feiteng, a researcher on Asia-Pacific studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that China may ask the new Cabinet to be cautious on trade policies, and attention will be given to the Taiwan question and the South China Sea issue to prevent a deteriorating regional security situation. Zhang Yansheng, secretary-general of the National Development and Reform Commission's Academic Committee, said Trump's team is advocating anti-globalization measures and trade protectionism to try to gain an advantage for the US. Trump's team said secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson would knock China's islands construction program in the South China Sea and its policies on Pyongyang's nuclear program, Reuters reported.

Beijing will launch its bimonthly license lottery session to allocate the limited car license plates on Tuesday, in which the whole year's quota for new energy vehicles - 54,000, the same as last year - will be used up, and the remaining applicants will get in line for quotas in future years, according to the statement released on the official website of the Beijing Transport Commission on Monday. Nearly 390,000 applicants will be asking for a license plate and those newly enrolled in the lottery system may need to wait as long as eight years if only 54,000 license plates are allotted annually. On the other hand, the number of gasoline-powered cars has exceeded 3.1 million. That means the competition to win the lottery has become more intense since only 40,000 will be allotted this year via six sessions. For 2019, the annual car license quota in Beijing is 100,000, the same as last year. The new energy vehicle quota is 60,000, while the rest is for gasoline-powered cars, according to data released previously by the city's transport commission. The capital introduced the license plate lottery system in 2011 to curb the rapid growth of automobiles, among measures in recent years to control deteriorated air quality."
1,"Chinese internet and mobile app publisher Cheetah Mobile Inc is stepping up efforts to expand its presence in overseas countries by upgrading its products and services with artificial intelligence technologies.  Fu Sheng, CEO of the Beijing-based company, said it is very important to have abundant application scenarios and a large number of users to achieve breakthroughs in AI and this is exactly in line with the company's edge.  By applying image recognition technologies to Live.me, a live streaming platform which is ranked as the most popular social-networking app on Google Play app store in the United States, the company said it can now automatically track user-generated content. The move has greatly boosted work efficiency and lowered labor costs.  Cheetah Mobile has also invested $400 million into an AI startup called Beijing Orion Star Technology Co Ltd, in a move to beef up its technology prowess.  Unlike the first-wave of Chinese internet players such as Baidu Inc and Tencent Holdings Ltd which rely on the domestic market to thrive, Cheetah Mobile gets 75.4 percent of its nearly 600 million monthly active users from abroad. The firm has managed to achieve that within just six years.  The Beijing-based company started to zero in on overseas markets after competition in the domestic market intensified in 2012. It worked hard to adapt itself to foreign markets.  ""Our strategy is straight-forward: develop utility apps, which are hardly subject to cultural influences and enjoy universal, steady demand,"" Chen Bo, a software developer at Cheetah said.  The Beijing-based company quickly gained a presence by rolling out Clean Master, the Android junk cleaning app, and CM Security, which protects smartphones with anti-virus software and privacy.  But unexpectedly, cultural obstacles still popped up. ""Users in the Middle East complained against an ad on our app because the girls on that ad wore off-shoulder tops,"" Chen said. ""We then worked hard to localize our apps as per overseas sensibilities.""  Cheetah Mobile found advertisement revenue hard to come by as users generally don't use e-tools and apps of the kind it develops every day. As a result it has been transforming itself into a content business through research and acquisitions.  ""Apps that provide content and services, such as social media apps, live streaming apps, maps, mobile payments apps and online shopping apps have become the new trend for Chinese developers who are targeting emerging and developed markets,"" said Wei Fangdan, CEO of Baijingapp, an online community of more than 40,000 domestic app developers who have global aspirations.  In the third quarter of this year, Cheetah Mobile generated 154 million yuan ($23.4 million) in operating profit, marking a 303 percent year-on-year growth."
0,"Audiences might still remember the impressive opera production of Giacomo Puccini's Turandot－conducted under the baton of Zubin Mehta and directed by Zhang Yimou－that was performed at Beijing's historical Imperial Ancestral Temple, which is located just outside the Forbidden City, in September 1998. That same venue－a UNESCO World Heritage Site－was once again awash with melody on Wednesday, when Universal Music Group's Deutsche Grammophon, the world's oldest classical music label, launched its 120th-anniversary celebrations by hosting a gala concert there. Musicians from around the world shared the stage, performing for an audience of over 1,200. Under the baton of maestro Yu Long, the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra opened the concert with a special arrangement of Chinese composer Liu Tianhua's work, Enchanted Night. Then, the orchestra performed German composer Carl Orff's Carmina Burana accompanied by Russian soprano Aida Garifullina, British tenor, Toby Spence, and French baritone, Ludovic Tezier, as well as the Shanghai Spring Children's Choir. Afterward, French pianist, Helene Grimaud, took the stage for Ravel's Piano Concerto in G major before Norwegian violinist, Mari Samuelsen, took the solo lead in November, a piece from Max Richter's Memoryhouse, a seminal work of contemporary neoclassical composition from 2002. ""The gala concert was unforgettable,"" says Clemens Trautmann, president of Deutsche Grammophon. ""The concert's historic nature was enhanced by its iconic setting－in front of the Imperial Ancestral Temple and the walls of the Forbidden City. Those exquisite buildings echoed to the magnificent sounds of the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, Wiener Singakademie and an international cast of soloists under the direction of maestro Yu, the first Chinese conductor ever to perform there."" Russian pianist Daniil Trifonov performed Rachmaninov's Second Piano Concerto. The 27-year-old virtuoso pianist, a leading member of Deutsche Grammophon's younger generation of artists, was accompanied by Yu and the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, which was their first collaboration. ""We had a mutual musical language, which made our cooperation successful,"" says Trifonov. ""I was very excited, even when I did rehearsal with Yu and the Orchestra."" ""I visited Forbidden City as a tourist when I performed in Beijing a couple of years ago, but I have never performed at such a historic site before,"" he recalls. ""The performance cannot be compared to any that I have done before, which was quite amazing."" Trifonov, who began playing piano at 5 years old, studied under Tatiana Zelikman at Moscow's famous Gnessin School of Music. In February 2013, he made his debut at Carnegie Hall in a concert recorded by Deutsche Grammophon for an album that was released later that year. In January, Trifonov was awarded the 2018 Grammy Award for Best Classical Instrumental Solo for his album, Transcendental-Complete Liszt Etudes. In June, Yu, arguably China's most well-known conductor on the international scene, and the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra also signed with Deutsche Grammophon, becoming the Berlin-based label's first Chinese conductor and orchestra. Their first recording with the famous yellow label will be released in 2019 to mark the 140th anniversary of the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, the oldest symphony orchestra in China, whose history dates back to 1879 when it was known as the Shanghai Public Band. Deutsche Grammophon's Imperial Ancestral Temple concert marked the beginning of a series of international programs, including the release of a collection of newly digitized rare archive recordings (The Shellac Project) and new albums of high-profile performances. The record label also introduced China to its project, Yellow Lounge－which aims to introduce clubbers to live classical music－with a performance at Beijing's Mao Livehouse featuring British-Irish classical violinist, Daniel Hope, Chinese clarinetist, Wang Tao, and the Zurich Chamber Orchestra back in September. The project was born in 2001 in Berlin's techno clubs, and since then, Yellow Lounge has organized over 130 club nights, each attracting up to 1,000 guests and a massive following through both traditional channels and social media."
1,"Shen Wenhao is about to pay the final installment of his air ticket that brought him from his home of Qingdao, Shandong province, during the National Day holiday in October.  ""I looked for an affordable air ticket before the holiday, and discovered that I can pay by installments without down payment on Spring Airlines' app,"" said the 25-year-old, who works for a logistics company.  Like Shen, many people benefit from the new payment service launched by Shanghai-based budget carrier Spring Airlines, which aims to innovate travel consumption through its smartphone app.  All registered members of Spring Airlines aged between 18 and 55 years old can apply for the installment service when they buy Spring Airlines tickets without using a credit card or third party payment, said Zhou Haiyang, marketing manager of Spring's financial division.  ""Consumers can either choose installments of three, six, nine and 12 with zero down payment, and the monthly service charge is as low as between 0.6 percent and 0.9 percent,"" said Zhou.  In less than three months, the service has handled up to 50,000 customers, and the company is going to launch a similar service for its traveling products.  In the past few years, Spring has started offering online services, such as the foreign currency exchange that it added in April in cooperation with Ctrip Financial Services Co.  ""I had very a bad experience in exchanging Chinese yuan for the destination country's currency before, but it all went smoothly this time,"" said Zhang Jue, who tried Spring's currency exchange service in September before her trip to the United States.  According to Zhang, she booked online and collected the money without queuing on Saturday at one of Spring's counters that offer the service.    ""This is much more convenient than going to banks that require you to go on weekdays and wait for hours. The situation becomes even more complicated if the foreign currency is not that common. So sometimes, I ask my parents to do that for me,"" Zhang said.  For the moment, as many as 28 foreign currencies can be exchanged online through Spring's app, and the bank notes can be picked up at about 130 locations in 15 Chinese cities including Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, Tianjin and Chongqing, said Zhou.  ""It's worth mentioning that the exchange service also provides a follow-up option where customers can change the leftover foreign currency back at the same currency exchange rate when they return to China,"" Zhou added.  Spring said nearly 50 million yuan worth of foreign currencies were exchanged in the past six months, and there are plans to extend the service to more Chinese cities next year."
1,"DUBAI - China's flag carrier Air China said Monday that it will increase the flights between Beijing, the Chinese capital, and Dubai of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) from five a week to daily service from March. The announcement was made by Zhang Bi, general manager of Air China's Dubai Sales Department, at a press conference held at Grand Hyatt Dubai. ""This arrangement, scheduled to start from March 26, will provide passengers travelling between China and the UAE with more choices, and further increase the bilateral exchanges between the two countries,"" he said. Zhang said that the Beijing-Dubai route will be operated by Airbus three-class A330-300 aircraft equipped with a total of 295 seats, including 28 business class seats, 16 preferred economy class seats and 251 economy class seats. ""Whether flying from Beijing to Dubai or flying from Dubai to Beijing, our flights are competitive in time, and passengers can have a better rest and less travel fatigue,"" Zhang said. Li Lingbing, the consul general of China in Dubai, hailed Dubai as ""an important pivotal city and regional transport hub"" for the Belt and Road Initiative. The initiative was proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013 with the aim of building a trade and infrastructure network connecting Asia with Europe and Africa along ancient trade routes. Dubai is playing an increasingly important role in promoting interconnection between China and Middle Eastern countries, Li said. ""I believe Air China and other Chinese airlines will continue to expand their services in Dubai,"" Li said. This will promote the mutually beneficial cooperation in various fields between China and Arab countries and make new contributions to the bilateral exchanges, he added."
1,"Zhang Tianyi decided that he never wanted to see, let alone eat, a bowl of noodles again. And who could have blamed him? In the interests of market research, the law graduate sampled 30 tiny bowls of noodles every single day for three months, at the end of which his tongue was numb and his stomach seemed to be perpetually on fire, he said. Yet, Zhang somehow convinced himself that his future was inextricably intertwined with noodles, a decision based on his discovery of what he said is the ideal noodle recipe. That recipe brought about Funiutang, his branded beef and rice noodles dish, based on the most common street food in his hometown, one he has turned into a multimillion dollar business success in Beijing, and whose fame he hopes will stretch to the four corners of the globe. ""As with McDonald's in the United States, I want the name and image of Funiutang to appear wherever the red flag with five stars is raised,"" Zhang said. Since Zhang and three of his classmates founded Funiutang in 2014, and after several rounds of financing, its value is put at up to 500 million yuan ($78 million.) As the chief executive officer, Zhang, 28, now manages 17 offline restaurants in Beijing with about 400 employees, in a company that reaped about 100 million yuan in revenue last year. Beef and rice noodles, a spicy, salty and oil noodle made from rice, is one of the specialties in Changde, Hunan province, that has a history of 6,500 years and one that Zhang said he and fellow locals eat every day. Indeed homesickness was one of the things that set him on his quest for the perfect dish. Another was the potential he saw in rice-based food products worldwide as the status of China, where much of the world's rice is consumed, continues to rise. ""The world has long been dominated by wheat because it's eaten in Western countries,"" he said. ""It's a pity that rice noodles, despite their long history, don't have a brand."" He decided to go into the food business three months before he graduated in law from Peking University so that if the venture left him penniless he would still have time to find a job. Much to his surprise, things went well. Now, he said, he has enough patience and confidence that he can envisage it taking him 10 years to build a rice noodle brand that is widely recognized. Specifically, the goal is to open 500 to 1,000 restaurants in cities worldwide in the future, including in the US and Europe. At a Funiutang outlet in Zhongguancun, in the Haidian district of Beijing, all the service and kitchen staff wear black T-shirts inscribed with the word baman, Hunan dialect meaning never give up, dare to say no and be yourself, Zhang said. ""Just as McDonald's represents Americans' culture of fast, clean and efficient service, we want to share the spirit of Chinese young people with our brand - hard-working, positive about life, and who are ambitious enough to pursue their dreams."" The company pumps that kind of ethos in many of its marketing products, including decorations, short videos and WeChat stories. The distinctive corporate culture plays an important role in brand-building, Zhang said. ""The domestic dining market is undergoing a transformation with the demand of a rising generation of customers who value the culture and spirit embodied in a product, rather than its price and function."" Zhang said he is fortunate to be living at a time when the country is promoting innovation and entrepreneurship, and was reported to have met Li Keqiang in 2015 when the Chinese Premier visited Zhongguancun Inno Way, a cluster of startups and entrepreneurs. As a master's graduate from Peking University, rated as the country's top tertiary institution, Zhang said some people have taken a bleak view of his career, criticizing him for wasting his education to sell noodles. But Zhang said diligently doing things that some may regard as trivial and unimportant is worthy of respect. He held down about 50 different part-time jobs when he was at college, he said, including legal consulting, selling insurance, working as a receptionist and being assistant to a chief executive. Once he even tried out begging, just to experience life at its nadir, he said. ""Doing many different things gave me the opportunity to see how society really works. The perspective on life that formal education provides is far too limited."""
1,"China is prepared and will not hesitate to fight ""till the very end"" if the United States insists on unilateralism and protectionism, the Commerce Ministry said on Thursday. Government officials from the two countries have not engaged in any negotiations concerning the trade friction, said Gao Feng, Commerce Ministry spokesman. ""There are procedures to follow for negotiations to get started. But the US side has not shown any sincere will to negotiate yet,"" Gao said. ""China is well prepared for further actions taken by the US and will resolutely fight back if the US insists on unilateralism,"" Gao added. Gao also said the country's continued opening-up measures announced this week have nothing to do with the trade friction with the US. ""I hope some people in the US do not misjudge the situation,"" Gao said. Such major strategic decisions are made based on an accurate estimate of the country's current development level in order to elevate opening up in the new era to a higher level, Gao said. ""No one has the right to say why China does anything. The opening-up strategy came naturally during the development, and I don't think China is doing so to deal with the trade war. The motivation is for better development,"" said Bhattacharya Amar, a senior researcher at the Brookings Institution, a US think tank. ""China is facilitating global trade through the Belt and Road Initiative. What we have seen in the trade frictions between China and the US is a negative side where people say global trade causes problems. You need certain rules to the game so that both sides of trade feel they benefit,"" he said. The trade unilateralism and protectionism employed by the administration of US President Donald Trump will push more countries to unite and protect the World Trade Organization's rule-based multilateral trading system, said Tu Xinquan, director of the China Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. The US policies have led to negative impacts for all parties, especially to manufacturing powerhouses like China, Germany, the Republic of Korea and India, Tu said. The Commerce Ministry also said that China will complete a revision of the negative list for foreign investment in the first half of this year. Areas not on the negative list are presumed to be open to foreign investors. The country also will open industries including financial, services and manufacturing even wider to foreign investors and lower tariffs to increase imports as it helps facilitate the market entry of companies under all types of ownership so they can to compete at the same level, Gao said."
1,"Pan Yunsheng, a veteran, used to train army dogs years ago at a field force in Southwest China's Guangxi autonomous region. When his love for dog training did not fade away after retirement, Pan opened a dog boarding and training center in the suburb of Beijing six years ago. Pan has trained hundreds of dogs in the past years. Now, around 50 pet dogs live in Pan's training center, with some of them boarding temporarily, while others training hard for a graduation certificate. ""Our center is like a kindergarten for dogs,"" said Pan. He treats them like his children by providing them air-conditioning in summer and heating in winter, with electricity bill each month reaching 8,000 yuan ($1,195) in winter. Pan's training center posts revenue of about two million yuan a year, and he harvests a big hunk of love at the same time.,Both Little seven (Xiaoqi) and police dog Thunderbolt (Pili) in TV series   were trained by Pan. But most trainees at Pan's center are pet dogs, whose characteristics are totally different from that of army and police dogs. ""Army and police dogs have distinctive personalities, but the personalities of pet dogs are various, which demand wholly different training methods,"" said Pan. Police dog training is like training professional athletes, while pet dog training is more like training kindergarteners, and there is no conception such as good kids or bad kids,"" Pan said. ""It's like raising kids, they let you down sometimes, but you still need to stick to principles,"" Pan said as he summarized his 10-year dog experience. Well-trained dogs are better family members, thus, Pan plans to starts crowdfunding in his shop based on Alibaba's e-marketplace Taobao, and bring some stray dogs into his training session, and find new families for them. ""I hope dog owners can focus more on character building of their pets and treat them as equal family members,"" Pan said."
0,"More young musicians get a chance to show off their talent through the National Youth Orchestra of China program. One week after their training at the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing, young musicians from the National Youth Orchestra of China showcased their skills at the Yale Center on July 23. Among the students was Shanghai native Wang Yixiang, who performed the fourth movement of Mozart's String Quartet No 14 in G major. Wang, who started playing the violin at the age of 5 and graduated from the Music Middle School Affiliated to the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, will go to the United States this August for further training under Nicholas Mann, who is the chair of the string department at the Manhattan School of Music. ""I missed the chance to apply for the NYO-China program last summer,"" says Wang. ""So, when the program admission process opened this year, I applied."" As this year's focus was chamber music, 21 young musicians from China were taught by three teachers: violinist Li Qing, who is the principal second violin of the Baltimore Symphony, as well as a faculty member for violin at the Peabody Institute at Johns Hopkins University; Ma Yong, who is the principal flute at the China National Opera; and Chen Guang, a professor of trumpet at the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing. For two weeks in July, the young musicians gathered at the Central Conservatory of Music to rehearse a selection of works in the chamber music repertoire. Meanwhile, NYO-USA was touring China with a concert at the National Centre for the Performing Arts in Beijing, under the baton of Michael Tilson Thomas, featuring pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet.Some members of the NYO-China and NYO-USA also performed a chamber concert at the US embassy in Beijing. The US students played Chinese folk song Jasmine Flower and a piece for the string quartet composed by Chinese pipa player Wu Man. Speaking about the training and the performances, Wang says: ""I am interested in chamber music because it's a totally different way of thinking and performing, compared with playing as a soloist.,""Before, I used to focus on my own performance, but now I think more about the music itself rather than solely about technique."" NYO-China, which launched last summer and gathered 100-odd musicians from ages 16 to 19, was inspired by the National Youth Orchestra of the United States, a free program which started in 2013 by Carnegie Hall's Weill Music Institute. Last year, NYO-China made its debut at the Carnegie Hall in New York. Under the baton of French conductor Ludovic Morlot, the orchestra performed Chinese-American Zhou Long's The Rhyme of Taigu and Dvorak's Symphony No 9 (From the New World). Commenting on the performance, that featured Chinese pianist Yuja Wang, music critic Anthony Tommasini said in the New York Times that if the performance was a test run for the new venture ""these Chinese musicians scored big"". Unlike last year, which saw 105 young Chinese musicians between 14 to 21 performing together, this year, the program has narrowed down the number of participants to 21. ""We want to offer students a kind of intimacy which enables them to get close to their teachers with one-on-one training,"" explains Nicholas Brown, NYO-China's director of project development. As for the aims of the program, Vincent Accettola, the managing director of NYO-China, says: ""Our goal is to provide young student musicians from China access to superior instruction, performance opportunities and a platform from which they can represent their country and their generation to the world."" Accettola moved to initiate the program last year after seeing young Chinese watching their performance during the NYO-US China tour in 2015. As for the response to the program, Chinese composer Ye Xiaogang who is the director of NYO-China says that he is happy to see young Chinese musicians of NYO-China this year hailing from not only music conservatories, but also non-conservatories, such as Beijing Bayi School and Shandong Jinan No 13 Middle School. ""This is exactly what our mission is. We are not only open to professional musicians, but also young people who love music. With this program, students learn more than how to play an instrument,"" says Ye, who is also chairman of the Chinese Musicians' Association and vice-president of the Central Conservatory of Music. Robert Blocker, senior adviser for global artistic affairs, NYO-China, who has served as the Henry and Lucy Moses Dean of Music at Yale University since 1998, says: ""There are skills that the students learned in the program that are transformative. ""In chamber music, they learn independence, discipline and the skill of being able to work collaboratively. ""For example, a string quartet from Yale has four people from four countries, speaking four languages, but they share one common language, the language of music. ""And through that language, they communicate with each other, they tell each other their dreams, they share with each other the reality of life, and from that they build a bridge of understanding."""
1,"The launch ceremony of the Asian Financial Cooperation Association will be held in Beijing on July 24, the Foreign Ministry said on Thursday, eying its positive role in maintaining regional and global financial stability. Ministry spokesperson Lu Kang released the information at a daily news briefing and congratulated the association on the scheduled ceremony. Lu said China has been long committed to pushing forward communication and cooperation among regional financial institutions. President Xi Jinping discussed establishing a platform to facilitate communication and cooperation among Asian financial institutions at the Boao Forum for Asia in March 2015. On a number of occasions since then, Premier Li Keqiang proposed setting up the Asian Financial Cooperation Association. ""We are pleased to see that the proposals made by Chinese leaders won active responses and strong support from financial institutions in Asia and other regions,"" Lu said. The association, based in Beijing, was officially set up on May 11. A total of 107 institutions from five continents are founding members. China expects the association to play an active role in ""maintaining the stability of regional, and even global financial markets and promoting common development and prosperity in the region"", Lu said."
1,"College students born between 1995 and 2000 are becoming a vital new part of the dynamic travel market in China, with most of the young students making their first summer trips after enrolling in colleges, a new study said. Though the motivation for making tours is relatively high among college students, their choices are limited due to economic constraints with price being the major criteria for booking flight tickets, said the study conducted by Qunar, an online travel firm owned by Ctrip, China's largest online travel agency. During summer vacations, students tend to choose flights that depart between midnight and 2 am, as well as between 5 am and 9 am. The number of bookings of red-eye and budget flights is nearly three times higher than other regular flights, the Qunar study said. Companies are also introducing low-price options to attract the young consumer group. In late May, Qunar teamed up with 33 domestic and foreign carriers, including Air China, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines, Hainan Airlines, United Airlines and All Nippon Airways, to launch discounted prices for students on more than 3,000 routes, along with the concept of student flight tickets. Students who have registered successfully with their identification documents on the platform will be able to book cheaper tickets. For instance, a one-way flight ticket from Guangzhou to Beijing can be as cheap as 460 yuan ($66.7), which is about half of the price tag - 862 yuan - for a second-class seat on a high-speed train. Qunar said such low-price flight tickets compared with high-speed trains may change the travel habits of college students and create user stickiness. ""Low travel costs may stimulate college students to travel more frequently, and enable them to have higher budgets for spending on accommodation and destination entertainments,"" said Sun Peiming, director of e-commerce at Sichuan Airlines. Last year, along with graduate students, there were 37 million enrolled college students in the country, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. In 2018, students registered on Qunar flew 4.4 times annually on average, higher than the average of 3.45 times nationwide, according to the company. ""Low prices have a decisive impact on their choices. Companies that provide cheaper options will attract more students and gain the initiative in seizing those future backbone consumers,"" said Liu Simin, a researcher at the Beijing Foreign Studies University. Candice Chen, a graduate studying in Beijing, traveled with a few of her friends to Japan in January. Despite living in Beijing, she bought return flight tickets that departed from the nearby city Tianjin to Japan, and the return tickets cost less than 1,500 yuan in total. ""It's a great deal as I can save more money for shopping in Japan. It's convenient to take a high-speed train from Beijing to Tianjin, which only took half an hour, and then I caught a taxi to go to Tianjin airport,"" she said. Last year, the per capita spending of college students on flights edged up 2.6 percent year-on-year, the study said without disclosing specific numbers, and indicated their high sensitivity on flight ticket prices. Despite that they try to save more money in buying flight tickets, college students prefer to stay at better hotels. Last year, the per capita spending of college students on hotels reached 234 yuan per night, jumping 17.5 percent over the previous year, and the growth rate was higher than the older generation. Besides, the report found that students are likely to spend twice the amount of money on hotels two years after graduation. Qunar has cooperated with more than 6,000 hotels, hostels and bed-and-breakfast services and launched discounted hotel prices for students."
1,"Police and demolition workers descended on a spot in Beijing known for its bars, restaurants and boutique stores on Tuesday, as the city continues its crackdown on illegal structures.  Urban management crews arrived in the morning along Fangjia Hutong, close to the Lama Temple in central Beijing, and began to brick up the door and windows of buildings earmarked for closure.  Notices placed at each end of the alley stated that the action was aimed at eliminating hidden dangers, improving residential quality and promoting the capital's image.  ""We received the announcement earlier, and the business owners nearby all knew what was going to happen, but we still can't decide who to talk with about this,"" said Li Qian, the owner of Ramo, a Western-style restaurant.  She said she rented the building three years ago. The original door in the rear, became the door to the kitchen after renovations.  According to the city, properties along the alley should conform with property ownership certificates.  Jiang Shuo, 28, who has run a tiny clothes store in Fangjia Hutong for seven years, was resigned to closing her business on Tuesday.  ""I have all the operating licenses and tax registration permits, but when the rule came out about the property certificates I had no option but to comply,"" she said, explaining that she had moved the original door because of the tight space.  An official at the Andingmen subdistrict office of the Dongcheng district government said the main reason for the action was to ""recover the original appearance of the  which is an integral part of the capital's traditional culture"".  The alley is the latest in a series of high-profile locations that have seen demolitions in recent weeks, following Sanlitun, Baochao Hutong and Dongsi. The work is part of a yearlong campaign to remove illegal buildings.  According to data from the Beijing Municipal Development and Reform Commission, more than 40 percent of the work has been completed.  The authorities say owners of ground-level homes across the city have knocked down walls and made other illegal alterations to be able to rent space to businesses. This, they say, has created safety risks and crowding in some areas.  The city allocated 10 billion yuan ($1.45 billion) for the campaign, which experts said will include reorganizing and upgrading residential retail businesses, Beijing Business Today reported.  Jiang Chenglong and Xin Wen contributed to the story."
0,"A powerful demonstration of the use of artificial intelligence in publishing was the talk of a recent book fair, but there was plenty of evidence that even as technology continues to carry the industry forward, China's past will continue to provide it with a strong foundation Two first-of-its-kind books representing two prominent publishing trends rubbed shoulders when they were launched at the Beijing International Book Fair, the world's second-largest book fair, that ended on Aug 26. At the fair visitors were able to wear virtual reality equipment that took them back to historic scenes such as the Red Army's Long March of 1934-36 and the Wenchuan earthquake in Sichuan in 2008. They could also relish the magnificence of the Grand Canal from Beijing to Hangzhou during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) by interacting with their smartphones connected to a big screen displaying images of the canal. An encyclopedia robot got to show off its skills to enthralled visitors, and some stalls presented the beauty of thousand-year-old Chinese characters or paper binding techniques. About 300,000 people visited the fair, organizers said, and over its five days more than 1,000 book events were staged throughout Beijing. At the fair 1,520 publishing organizations from 92 countries and regions joined another 1,000 local publishers and cultural related organizations. What they witnessed was a publishing world pushing on with the task of integrating the very latest technology into everything it does, even as it proudly embraces China's past and holds firm to its cultural roots. In doing so it is well aware that it has a receptive audience not only at home but increasingly abroad. In short, for Chinese publishers it is a matter of in with the old and in with the new. On the first day of the fair, visitors were able to get a taste of what may be the world's first book written - well, translated - by artificial intelligence. The book in question was a Chinese rendering of Blockchain: The Untold Story by Srinivas Mahankali translated by an identity going by the name of Youdao AI Translator. So efficient was the translator that the Publishing House of the Electronics Industry published the translation simultaneously with the original English version. ""In fact, at first we were a bit worried when we learned that we would be working with a machine translator,"" said Wang Chuanchen, president of Publishing House of the Electronics Industry. ""However, our confidence was restored when we saw the artificial intelligence's first draft."" It took the AI translator, powered by NetEase Youdao's Neutral Machine Translation technology, 30 seconds or so to render the English book of 100,000 words over 308 pages into Chinese. Liu Renlei, vice-president of Youdao, says the final print version combines AI's primary output with human editing. The team spent an extra of two weeks to finish up, including editing, polishing and rewriting. ""AI keeps learning as it's being fed more linguistic data. In this case the book was quite easy because it's a science work written in plain language, devoid of human emotion. We know how much more work needs to be done before AI can become a perfect translator."" Publishers may well be licking their lips as they admire AI's productivity - they would normally expect a translation such as the one it performed in half a minute to take half a year - but translators, many of whom already feel overworked and underpaid, are likely to have had a less glowing take on what AI holds for their prospects. In fact Ray Kurzwell, an American futurist, has been brave - or foolhardy - enough to put a date on the demise of human translators: 2029.,However, Li Changshuan, a professor with the Graduate School of Translation and Interpretation at Beijing Foreign Studies University, believes that the superiority of the human brain over electrical circuits and computer chips when it comes to translation is underestimated. ""Of course, AI may be able to help translators, but we have the upper hand when it comes to precision and accuracy."" Be that as it may, Chinese are embracing advanced AI technology in many fields, and last year the annual Government Work Report included the topic for the first time. In many ways publishing, a venerable business dating back a few centuries, and AI, yet to grow even a first set of teeth, seem ill matched, but the Youdao translation feat signals that these two unlikely partners are beginning to warm to one another, and that is likely to have an impact on Chinese publishing's dealings with the world, Liu said. In fact one of the topics of conversation at the fair was how our dear new friend AI might help us get a handle on the country's rich stock of ancient books. China National Publications Import & Export (Group) Corp, a major collaborator with overseas interests, signed agreements with three high-tech companies including China Literature Limited and China Unicom to explore a cloud data center with AI to update quality of service, channels and content to global publishers. Yang Feng, director of Fly Tek's AI publishing department, brought the topic of AI to the attention of international publishers at the Beijing International Publishing Forum on Aug 21, a day before the fair opened. AI could help publishing in at least two ways, Yang said. One was in searching for and obtaining content, and the other was in promotional work and deliveries. ""But AI can never, in any sense, shake the core values of publishing. And it will help with customer analysis and planning."" AI would be especially useful with audio books, which have become highly popular, and in the burgeoning knowledge sharing business, he said. An outsider's eye can often be useful in picking out trends, and staff of Austin Macauley Publishers in Britain told fair organizers that it had detected strong momentum in Chinese digital publishing, particularly with e-commerce being intertwined with social media. Publishers Weekly quoted Jade Robertson, Austin Macauley Publishers' international publishing director, as saying it was looking at working with Chinese publishers for both print and e-books and that the Beijing fair had been ""very much a learning trip to broaden our market knowledge"".,One of the many works unveiled in conjunction with the fair served to underline that while new technology is providing a crucial foundation for Chinese publishing as it faces the future, such tomes that point to the country's past will continue to have a pivotal and lucrative role. The work in question, the 10-volume Ornamental Patterns from Ancient Chinese Textiles, published by Zhejiang University Press, includes a fascinating tale of international conflict wrapped in silk. When China was living through the early Qing Dynasty and Empire Kangxi (1654-1722) was on the throne, Peter the Great of the Russian Empire fought several battles against the Swedish Empire. Some failed, and the Russian army's flags were seized by the Swedes and have been carefully archived until this very day. It turned out that the Russian flags were made of silk and made in China. To the surprise of Zhao Feng, a silk expert and director of the National Silk Museum in Beijing, these flags that are kept in a Swedish museum fill some of the missing links in our knowledge of early-Qing silk relics in China. ""We didn't know much of what silk products looked like in that period, and now they have been given an appearance thanks to this set of books."" The books are said to be the first of their kind for the breadth of scale in their researching, recording and being able to restore for the public record more than 10,000 ancient silk relics. With Zhao's series, visitors to the Beijing International Book Fair were thrown into a sea of digital data even as they remained on dry land relishing the continued beauty of printed books. Let it be noted, too, that this mingling of the old and new is hardly ... new. In fact some early telegraph and computer technology is said to owe its creation to careful study and copying of how silk was weaved into patterns on machines in ancient China. That kind of melding of old and new was evident in abundance at the fair. SDX Joint Publishing Company announced that in conjunction with the global academic publisher Springer Nature it would bring out a work in English on Fujian tulou, rural dwellings particular to the Hakka of Fujian province. In one work on display at the Beijing fair Citic Press has Ye Luying, a young illustrator, and Yu Zhiying, a writer, retelling stories of the legendary beauty Luo Shen from ancient paintings by Gu Kaizhi (348-409) in an illustrated book. Organizers said 5,678 copyright deals were completed at the fair, 7.9 percent more than last year. They included 3,610 copyrights that Chinese publishers sold to overseas market, and 2,068 bought from overseas. Countries related to the Belt and Road Initiative keep being the top buyers of Chinese copyrights. The fair also featured forums such as the Belt and Road Academic Summit for the New Era by the Renmin University Press, and the Belt and Road Publishing Forum by the 16th Beijing International Book Festival."
0,"A group of overseas students are enjoying a two-day tour of some of Beijing's most innovative companies to get a taste of the latest technology and the job opportunities on offer.   The tour on Monday and Tuesday has been organized by the Beijing Overseas Talents Center and Beijing Association for Science and Technology as part of activities to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China. The 18 students come from Hong Kong, Britain, Singapore, the Philippines and Pakistan, and all are participants in Hong Kong's PolyU Innovation and Entrepreneurship Global Student Challenge. In addition to experiencing the capital's competitiveness in science and innovation, they also learned about Chinese culture by visiting historical relics. ""Hong Kong and Beijing have unique advantages for attracting talent, and more cooperation and communication between the two should be encouraged to build a bigger platform for the younger generation,"" said Liu Minhua, director of talent recruitment for the Beijing city government. As China develops the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, the mainland will become a more popular destination for fresh graduates.   ""I've been to Shenzhen and Guangzhou (in Guangdong province) many times and seen the rapid economic development,"" said Cheung Tsz Kit, 23, a graduate of Hong Kong Polytechnic University. He said many of his classmates want to find jobs in these southern cities, but the lack of careers counseling is an obstacle.  ""Most universities don't have job fairs specifically for positions at mainland companies. We lack information, including on the recruitment process and employee services for Hong Kong residents,"" Cheung said. With the Belt and Road Initiative primed to boost regional development, students from countries along the Silk Road Economic Belt and 21st Century Maritime Silk Road are optimistic about a career in China. ""China is a superpower with great opportunities, not only compared with my country, but also other countries in the world,"" said Muhammad Salman, 28, of Pakistan, who is studying for a PhD in bioengineering at Beijing University of Technology.  ""I'd like to find a job here after graduation. China is place of hope,"" he said."
0,"Hema Fresh, the prototype supermarket chain of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd's New Retail concept, has launched a 24 hour delivery service in two Chinese cities as it strives to combine the online and offline shopping experience. From Sunday, customers in Shanghai and Beijing can place orders online on Hema's app from 10 pm to 7 am, when brick-and-mortar Hema stores are closed, and have their goods delivered in as little as 30 minutes within a radius of three kilometers. Customers now can satisfy their stomach in the middle of the night by ordering cooked seafood, snacks and beverages, as well as meet more intimate needs such as picking from among 700 sexual-wellness products including condoms and lubricants. The new service fits closely with Alibaba's efforts to realize its new ""three-kilometer ideal living community"" goal, which includes the integration of technologies and other services to pinpoint consumer needs, said Hema CEO Hou Yi. Claiming to be the first such service globally, Hema will serve as a ""touch point"" through which a suite of Alibaba's online offerings, be it e-commerce platform Tmall, video site Youku or travel service Fliggy, find their offline base, said Chris Tung, chief marketing officer of Alibaba. ""For example, we are mulling to host Southeast Asian travel and cuisine-themed events in partnership with Fliggy at Hema. You will start to see Hema become the avenue for a growing number of events serving local communities,"" he told China Daily on Saturday. Hema is shifting from meeting people's catering demands to addressing a wider variety of needs, according to Xu Rongcong, a chief analyst at China Merchants Securities Co Ltd. ""At this stage, profitability is not the top priority of Hema. The 24-hour delivery primarily aims to cultivate shopping habits and enhance customer loyalty, especially in Shanghai and Beijing where people have more spending power and are willing to try out new services,"" Xu said. The move came just days after it entered into partnerships with 13 leading property developers in China to help digitalize their commercial infrastructure, a step critical to achieving its target of having 100 retail stores by the end of this year. Hema, which debuted in 2016, is seen as the test ground for Alibaba's New Retail concept. With each store doubling as a warehouse, Hema allows both in-store and online shopping and features the use of technologies to predict sales, manage inventory and dispatch parcels."

Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang made the remarks at a daily news briefing after the White House said China will send officials to visit Washington next week to resume trade talks with the United States. The comments from the White House show Washington's wish to reach consensus with Beijing on trade issue and are a positive signal, Geng said. Resolving differences and handling trade frictions through equal negotiations is in line with the common interests of both sides as well as the world, he said."
0,"Last week's meeting between President Xi Jinping and Kim Jong-un, the top leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, indicates China is playing an essential role in the settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula, according to several US analysts. Kim paid an unofficial visit to China from March 25 to Wednesday, during which he met with Xi in Beijing. ""China's role is essential,"" said Jon Taylor, professor of political science at the University of St. Thomas in Houston. The visit to Beijing and the Xi-Kim meeting has ""reinforced China's role as a central actor in managing security issues in Northeast Asia in general and the Korean Peninsula in particular"", he said. During their Beijing meeting, Xi said China will continue to play a constructive role on the issue and work with all parties, including the DPRK, toward a thaw of the situation on the peninsula. Kim said it is his country's ""consistent stand to be committed to denuclearization on the peninsula"" and the DPRK is willing to have a dialogue with the United States and hold a summit between the two countries. The Xi-Kim meeting is expected to be followed by a flurry of other talks, such as the late-April summit between Kim and President Moon Jae-in of the Republic of Korea. These are ""quite relevant"" to the summit between US President Donald Trump and Kim in May, according to Taylor, who writes about China. ""The willingness of the principal parties to engage in diplomacy and dialogue on the Korean Peninsula issue is a hopeful sign,"" Taylor told China Daily. ""If the Moon-Kim summit goes as well as the Xi-Kim summit, the greater the likelihood that Trump and Kim will be able to ratchet down nuclear tensions and begin to address the challenge of developing a meaningful path to peace."" Yun Sun, co-director of the East Asia Program at the Stimson Center, a think tank in Washington, said, ""The significance (of the Xi-Kim meeting) is that China shows the world that China is indispensable in the process and cannot be excluded."" Sun said China has cooperated with Trump on sanctions and placing the maximum pressure on Kim, which has brought Pyongyang back to the negotiation table. ""Looking into the future, for any deal with North Korea to sustain, China will have to be included and most likely as a guarantor,"" she said in an email. The more ""consensus and amity"" Pyongyang and Seoul can build, between themselves and toward denuclearization, the more foundation it will pave for the engagement between Trump and Kim, she said. The Beijing meeting showed that whatever may come of the upcoming inter-Korean and North Korea-US summits, China will not be a peripheral, Ankit Panda, a senior editor with The Diplomat who covers Asia-Pacific security and the DPRK's ballistic-missile and nuclear-weapons programs, said in a Wednesday post. ""As this trip represents Kim's first known sojourn outside of the country to meet a foreign head of state, it suggests that the North Korean leader may not be averse to traveling outside of the country (perhaps even overseas) for a summit with the US president,"" said Victor Cha, Senior Adviser and Korea Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in a commentary co-authored with Sue Mi Terry, a senior fellow at the CSIS."
1,"FamilyMart has denied accusations that it sold expired food after a video came to light claiming that 21 of its convenience stores in 10 cities across the country did so. The video, released by review website Lanmei Testing - which is known for its expose of unhygienic practices at luxury hotels in 2017 - received immediate public attention on Tuesday soon after it was posted on Chinese social networks Sina Weibo and WeChat. On Weibo, the video accumulated nearly 10,000 comments within hours, while on WeChat the article containing the video had received more than 100,000 page views as of Tuesday evening. In response, FamilyMart's China operator, Shanghai Fumanjia Convenience Co, issued a statement on Tuesday afternoon saying the company has strict rules prohibiting sales of expired food and has inspected the stores mentioned in the video and found no such offenses. Instead, as it checked surveillance footage around the time when Lanmei Testing shot videos at their stores, it said, some ""unusual"" purchases were discovered that might have ended up in the video. In an online briefing session with the media, Wang Yiwen, the company's public relations manager, said the company has strict internal management rules for removing expired food, and that it might resort to the courts to defend its reputation. FamilyMart is one of the most popular convenience store brands in China, with more than 2,500 stores. Xu Penghao, chief editor of Lanmei Testing, said the website decided to investigate FamilyMart after one of its staff members bought an expired sandwich at a store he frequented in Beijing. Xu said when the customer went back to confront the convenience store manager, the manager showed no surprise and offered two cups of free coffee as compensation, which made him suspect that the sale of expired food was a common occurrence. From November to December, Lanmei Testing said, it visited 100 FamilyMart stores in 10 cities, including Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou and discovered expired food, especially bread and cakes, on shelves in 21 stores. Its video included footage of an investigator purchasing a cake that was one day past the expiration date at a FamilyMart store on Wangfujing street in Beijing on Nov 14. Lanmei Testing said it has preserved all its recordings taken in one shot and vouches for their authenticity. Many of the netizens commented that they have experienced similar issues in different convenience stores, including 7-11 and Lawson. ""We are not targeting anyone, but want to raise the attention of all convenience stores to make food safety a top priority,"" Xu said. Chinese news website Thepaper.cn reported that the Shanghai municipal market supervision bureau was investigating the case. In a FamilyMart store on Huaihai road in Shanghai, staff members said they had received instructions to double-check the shelves for any expired food."
0,"Beijing Capital International Airport, the nation's busiest, began to adjust departure times on Monday to ease traffic pressure and increase punctuality.  According to the Civil Aviation Administration's authority responsible for North China, the airport is reducing departures between 6 am and 9 am - the peak morning departure hours - and rescheduling them later in the day.  The total number of flights arriving and departing the airport daily - about 1,700 - doesn't change.  ""After the adjustment, the pressure of the early morning peak will be alleviated. That will reduce the potential that other flights, after 9 am, will be delayed. Airplanes will spend less time waiting, and passengers' experience will improve. In addition, fuel consumption will be reduced, which saves operating costs for airlines and is also better for the environment,"" the administration said.  About 198 flights will now leave during the morning peak between 6 am and 9 am, down from about 216.  The administration reminded passengers to pay attention to any schedule changes and plan accordingly.  The airport handled 94 million passengers in 2016, making it the second busiest in the world for the seventh consecutive year. The busiest is Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International."

The variety show, which gathers together and re-unites celebrity classmates, will air on the Shanghai-based broadcaster Dragon TV from May 19. The program is jointly produced by Dragon TV and Beijing-based TV production company, Joy Entertainment. Born in Beijing in 1963, Hu attended The Central Academy of China to learn acting in 1987. His classmates include Chen Xiaoyi, Jiang Shan, He Bing and Xu Fan, all widely considered to be among the best performers of their era. Hu, mostly known for his starring role as legendary warrior Qiao Feng in the 2003 hit TV drama  recalls his nickname on campus was Shao Ye (master of whistling) after his talent for mimicking dozens of sounds through whistling.,The show will also invite A-list alumni who graduated from Beijing Film Academy and Shanghai Theatre Academy, which alongside The Central Academy of China are commonly regarded as the country's top three drama colleges. Actors Chen He and Zheng Kai, who both attended the same acting class at Shanghai Theatre Academy in 2004 are joined on the show by their classmates Wang Xiaochen and Wang Wenna. In each episode, two teams of stars, under the banner of their former university and alongside several of their yet-to-be-famous classmates, will be assigned an acting challenge by their former teachers and will compete for a place in a final showdown. During the show, interesting stories, anecdotes and memories of the celebrities' college life will be revealed, such as how Huang Xiaoming’s romantic advances were rebuffed and the time when Zhang Ziyi, alongside Liu Ye, once went partying at a night club to better understand the characters they were assigned for a project."
0,"Products and services have been upgraded to benefit passengers, including online ticket purchasing, mobile payments, facial recognition for entering a station, easier transfers and onboard food ordering. All aim to satisfy diverse needs, according to China Railway Corp. Robots have also been added to several large stations to answer passengers' questions and provide entertainment. ""When passengers have questions about how to buy tickets, how to change a date or find restaurants or a nearby parking lot, robots can provide the answers,"" said Li Yang, a staff member at Jinan West Railway Station in Shandong province. The robots are amusing, too. ""It's not so boring"" to wait for trains anymore, Li said. The latest move－allowing passengers on some bullet trains to order food online from restaurants and have it delivered to their seats－started on July 17. The China Railway Corp ticket booking website and app allow users who intend to pass through selected stations to preorder meals, either from the train's catering service or from partner businesses, such as KFC. Initially, the service will be available at 27 high-speed rail stations in 24 cities, mainly provincial capitals and major metropolises, including Shanghai, Tianjin, Zhengzhou, Guangzhou and Nanjing. Liu Kun took a bullet train from Beijing to Qingdao and ordered KFC in advance when booking her ticket. The food was scheduled for delivery at Jinan West Railway Station. ""My food was delivered to my seat as soon as the train left Jinan. It was so convenient and the price is about the same as at KFC stores,"" Liu said. According to CRC, the move aims to meet the diverse and individualized demands of passengers by introducing more brands and restaurants, diversifying meal choices and providing richer services. New technology also enriches passengers' travel experiences. At Lanzhou West train station in Lanzhou, Gansu province, a facial recognition system was installed in May to allow passengers to pass the security check more efficiently,"" said Wang Jian, the station head. A facial recognition system can speed up verification of passenger identity, which was done before by train station staff members checking train tickets and ID cards. Now, passengers scan their tickets and ID cards at the facial recognition machine. When passengers make the scan, a camera installed in the machine will capture facial images. If the image matches the ID card and ticket, the gate will open automatically to allow entry. Several large train stations have launched facial recognition systems, including Guangzhou, Beijing and Changsha. Beijing West Railway Station was among the first to have it. A passenger surnamed Zhang experienced the facial recognition there in December when it was first launched. ""It was fun to go through the gate using the facial recognition system. But it sometimes slows things down at the checkpoint because passengers are not familiar with the new technique,"" Zhang said, adding that she prefers the facial recognition system when not in a hurry."

The main character is Háry János, who claims to be a folk hero. He's a veteran hussar of the Austrian army during the first half of the 19th century who sits in the village inn regaling his listeners with fantastic tales of heroism. His supposed exploits include winning the heart of the Empress Marie Louise, the wife of Napoleon, and then single-handedly defeating Napoleon and his armies. Nevertheless, he finally renounces all his riches to go back to his village with his sweetheart. The stories conjured up in his imagination are an inextricable mixture of realism and naivety, of comic humor and pathos. Though superficially he appears to be merely a braggart, essentially he is a natural visionary and poet. Budapest Puppet Theater, one of the largest puppet theaters central Europe, was founded on Oct 8, 1949.

1,"Police in Tianjin have confiscated 600 bitcoin mining computers after the local power grid reported abnormal electrical consumption. According to Xinhua News Agency, an electrical line monitored by the power company in Tianjin recently saw a sudden increase in line losses of up to 28 percent during peak hours. Investigators said they found that an electrical junction box for a power user's electricity meter had been bypassed, which is a typical way to escape billing. Bitcoins are a virtual currency used to buy other currencies, products and services online. Bitcoin mining uses algorithms to verify transactions, and miners earn bitcoins in exchange. Powerful computers are used to calculate algorithm outcomes before other miners, so bitcoin miners usually seek locations with easy access to cheap electricity. Basically, the fastest computer wins. It was estimated that the monthly electrical charge for 600 such computers would be hundreds of thousands of yuan. Online exchanges of virtual currencies have been closed in China. Local police said that one person was detained and five others are under investigation. Eight high-powered cooling fans were seized. In January, Beijing police cracked a case involving the theft of 100 bitcoins worth more than 2 million yuan ($316,000) at the time, according to media reports. The suspect, surnamed Zhong, an operations maintenance engineer at a Beijing-based internet technology company, embezzled bitcoins from the company. He was detained in March and is awaiting trial."
0,"BEIJING - Coal burning is no longer a major source of PM2.5 in Beijing, while car emissions have become the top cause, according to a study released by Beijing's environment watchdog Monday. The new findings come as Beijing is encouraging the use of natural gas instead of coal for winter heating and shutting down polluting smokestack factories. Emissions from vehicles, ships, and construction machinery are the top sources of PM2.5 (particulate matter of diameter less than 2.5 micrometres), contributing up to 45 percent of the total pollutants in Beijing, according to the study by Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau. Beijing has the highest level of car ownship in the country, with 5.64 million privately-owned cars at the end of 2017. The city has cut the number of license plates issued annually from 240,000 in 2013 to 100,000 in 2017. The study also showed that Beijing's surrounding regions contributed to more than 50 percent of the pollutants on heavily polluted days when the air quality index (AQI) exceeded 200 in the city. Air samples were gathered daily in 11 different locations around Beijing and more than 300,000 sets of data were analyzed, said Liu Baoxian, deputy director of Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Monitoring Center, under Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau. The level of PM2.5 in Beijing has dropped to its lowest level since 2013 when the national air pollution control campaign began. Across the country, average PM2.5 density in 338 cities fell by 6.5 percent in 2017."

The Beijing youth applied to go to Jingyuan county, where living conditions were harder, rather than Yinchuan, the capital, and stayed there for the rest of his life. Fifty years ago, people in Jingyuan were almost illiterate. When a production team distributed grain and means of production, people recorded what they received by drawing pictures of the items, such as potatoes or corn. Villagers didn't know they needed to send their children to school and the children didn't want to go to school.,Ma himself dragged his first students to school from their bedrooms. Speaking of the school, there were no classrooms when he first arrived. ""He set up planks as tables in a cowshed during the day when the cows were herded outside,"" said Ma Jinqiang, Ma Zhongyu's eldest son. The village teacher had to be a master of many abilities. Ma Zhongyu learned to build houses, repair roofs, cut glass into small pieces and weave bamboo baskets. In his spare time, Ma picked herbs in the mountains with his students. He washed and dried the herbs and sold them at markets in neighboring Gansu province. If he was lucky, he could earn one yuan and bought stationary for the students.,Between the 1950s and 1970s, he spent more than 1,000 yuan of his own money on students' stationary and medical bills. It was a big expenditure, considering that he earned 41.5 yuan per month and had to raise a family of eight. Ma Jinqiangbecame a teacher like his father. In his opinion, his father's generation laid the foundation for education in Ningxia."
0,"Two gunshots were heard at the Bethune International Peace Hospital in Shijiazhuang, Hebei province, in December 1949. A Japanese doctor was shot dead by Sha Fei (1912-50), a patient of tuberculosis and a noted photographer of the People's Liberation Army. Two months later, Sha was sentenced to death by a military court in China. A retrial in 1986 acquitted Sha posthumously saying he was in mental distress as he was reminded of the cruelty of war scenes when seeing the Japanese doctor, and he thought the doctor had attempted to poison him. Sha took up photography in the 1930s and became the first full-time photographer of the Eighth Route Army led by the Communist Party of China around 1937. But, Sha's career as a photographer was short lived, and his work was not studied or presented until in recent times. A Tower of Light, an exhibition now on at the museum of Beijing Fine Art Academy, sheds light on Sha's contribution to 20th-century Chinese photography. On show are some 100 images from Sha's oeuvre, which are printed from the negative plates owned by his family.,  The display includes his early works before Sha joined the Eight Route Army. Sha, whose birth name was Situ Chuan, was from Guangdong province. He changed his name to Sha Fei (""flying sand"") saying that he wanted to be like a grain of sand and freely fly in the sky of his homeland. He started as a telegraph operator and later developed an interest in photography. As a photographer, he not only focused on scenery, but also, he zoomed in on those who struggled at the bottom of society such as rural women, children and adults in destitution, and rickshaw pullers. He held his first solo show in Guangzhou in 1936. In the preface for the show, he said: ""The undertaking of art is to help people understand themselves, transform society and regain freedom."" He said that photographers should not separate themselves from society, but instead they should reach out to people from different walks of life. The late Li Hua, a friend and lithography artist, once said that Sha's works capture vividly the coexistence of people's desires and psychological battles, and each photo is ""like a painting that shows the vicissitudes of one's life and makes people reflect"".,  Sha later moved to Shanghai, where he met Lu Xun (1881-1936), the writer whom he photographed. The exhibition features two photos, in which Lu Xun is with young artists at a national woodcut exhibition. The writer avidly promoted wood engraving as a way to spread revolutionary ideas. There is also one of his last portraits by Sha at the show. Speaking about that picture, Sha had said that he rushed to Lu Xun's home after hearing about his death, and took the photo in great grief. After Sha was executed, people found on his body a box in which there were the negatives of the Lu Xun pictures, according to Yang Xiaoyan, a professor of Guangzhou-based Sun Yat-sen University. For Sha, Canadian physician and communist Norman Bethune (1890-1939) was another iconic face. The two met when they both served in the Jinchaji revolutionary area.,  One photo at the show depicts Bethune in the middle of an operation. It is one of dozens of snapshots focusing on soldiers in Jinchaji and battle scenes from the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression (1931-45). Through Sha's lens, people also see a lively, gentle side of Bethune. His other portraits at the exhibition show Bethune getting along with villagers, enjoying an egg dish cooked by his guardian, He Zixin, sunbathing and even swimming nude.

0,"In 2012, tons of recyclable wastes were disposed every day in several waste disposal hubs in Beijing's suburbs. People who worked there usually lived in shacks of few square meters in a dirty and stinky environment. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in November that year, Beijing has adopted measures to clean these disposal hubs so as to echo the national strategy of enhancing ecological civilization. In 2017, China Daily returned to the villages and compared the current situation with photos taken five years ago. Meadows and lines of seedlings have taken the place of the waste areas. New disposal hubs have been built in planned areas outside Beijing and equipped with new technology and infrastructure that makes recycling more eco-friendly and efficient. With a better environment, the transformation of waste disposal villages will contribute to Beijing's environmental improvement and help get rid of its non-capital functions."
1,"CHANGCHUN - Chinese automaker FAW Group is set to launch a new Hongqi SUV model to target private buyers, the group said at this year's World Internet Conference (WIC) that closed Friday. The luxury SUV model Hongqi HS7 is scheduled to hit the market in 2019. Meanwhile, the company's first Hongqi electric SUV, unveiled at the Beijing International Automotive Exhibition this year, is also scheduled to hit the market in 2019. Both the SUV and electric car models are being launched to explore the private car market. Earlier this month, the company unveiled a partnership with Baidu to develop a near-full autonomous vehicle in 2019 and achieve mass production by the end of 2020. The company's first fully autonomous Apolong minibuses, rolled out earlier this year, are now running in over 10 locations. Hongqi has set sales targets of 100,000 cars in 2020, 300,000 in 2025 and 500,000 in 2035, said FAW Group Chairman Xu Liuping. It will introduce 17 car models, including electric and SUV models, by 2025. The first Hongqi, or Red Flag, car was made in 1958. Hongqi is one of China's iconic sedan brands and has been used as the vehicle for parades at national celebrations. Established in 1953 in the northeastern Chinese city of Changchun, FAW was the first automaker in China."

The 11,000-square-meter media center, located in the convention center's E1 and E2 exhibition halls, offers two separate newsrooms accommodating 260 and 150 reporters, respectively. A workroom for up to 546 reporters is also available. Ru Tao, director with the media center's general management, said that culture-oriented exhibitions and projects, including traditional Chinese paintings, are also open to reporters and conference attendees. Zhang Yale, a coordinator from the Beijing Decorative Porcelain Museum, said four displays featuring Chinese intangible cultural heritage are ready to receive members of the media. ""The dialogue focuses on cultural exchanges among countries and regions in Asia,"" he said. ""We hope that people who get involved in our participatory projects will learn more about Chinese culture by making these handicrafts themselves. It also eases their work tension."" The four displays include traditional Chinese painting and ceramics, he said, and demonstrations are free of charge. ""All these items look small, but take great effort to make,"" he said. High-tech is also a highlight of the media center's operations as robotic assistants, virtual reality and 3D printing projects are available. Xia Min, a partner at Beijing-based 3D-FAB Ltd, is responsible for introducing 3D-printing technology to reporters and conference attendees. ""We applied new 3D-printing technology called LEAP (Light Enabled Additive Production), whose print speed is 100 times faster than traditional 3D printing. This shortens the time to make a finished product to about 10 minutes,"" Xia said. ""Reporters and conference participants can paint their own logos with different colored pens,"" she said. ""Actually, many people have no idea about 3D printing, so it's quite important to popularize this technology and let people know the progress China has achieved in this area."" A robot named Ai Mi is ready to greet and assist journalists and attendees at the media center. Staff members of the center said Ai Mi can give information to conference attendees in face-to-face conversations. So far, over 2,900 reporters from home and abroad have signed up to attend the conference, about 380 of whom are from overseas media groups. The media center will be open until Thursday evening."
1,"Fresh US tariffs on imports from China reflect the Trump administration's vested political interests and its indifference to the demands of US farming community, companies and consumers, trade experts and business leaders said on Monday. Their comments came after the US administration of threatened on Monday (local time) to impose a 10 percent tariff on $200 billion of Chinese goods, in retaliation for China's decision to raise tariffs on $50 billion in US goods. Trump said in a statement he had asked the US trade representative to identify the Chinese products to be subject to the new tariffs and he threatened that if China increases tariffs again, the US will meet the action by pursuing additional tariff on another $200 billion of Chinese goods. The US announced to impose 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion worth of imports from China on June 15. Following that announcement, China said it will protect its own interests and levy tariffs on about $50 billion worth of US imports based on the ""equal scale and strength"" principle, mainly targeting soybean, aquatic and automobile products. Li Daokui, an economist at Tsinghua University and former Chinese central bank monetary policy committee member, said: ""US policymakers aren't being responsible toward American people, but appear to be keen on pleasing a few vested interests and voters for short-term gains."" US economic problems go far beyond its trade deficit. The Trump administration needs to be farsighted and address some of its fundamental issues in the long run. China-US negotiations will be a long and bumpy road as some US politicians appear keen to keep bilateral trade relations friction-ridden, according to Li. ""Trade friction is what many US politicians crave. They are doing so to win more voters. If the Trump administration reach any deal with China, the opposition party would punch holes in any such agreement and blame the incumbent for failing to come up with a better decision and interpret the deal as a compromise with China,"" Li said. Agreed Fu Zhenzhen, an analyst with CnAgri, a Beijing-based agricultural consultancy. ""What the Trump's administration has done appears to be totally driven by political purposes. Because unlike in April, when there was time and space for change, this time the situation is markedly different. ""For, the US farmers have already planted the soybean crop, which includes 30 million metric tons of soybean that are planned to be exported to China. If the US government can't solve the issue by September when the crop would be ready for the harvest, there will be a huge problem for the US soybean industry."" Fu further said if the US farmers are deprived of access to the Chinese market, they will likely face immense trouble in finding alternative markets for the 30 million tons of soybean at short notice. Brian Kuehl, executive director of Farmers for Free Trade, expressed similar sentiments in a statement on Friday. For American farmers, export woes are not just a possibility but a downright scary prospect, he said. The new US tariffs are no longer a trade negotiation tactic but a heartless tax on the livelihoods of US farmers, Kuehl said. ""Within days, soybean, corn, wheat and other commodity farmers in the US are likely to be hit with retaliatory tariffs of up to 25 percent on exports. It's exports that keep their operations afloat. When they (retaliatory tariffs) hit them, they're not going to remain silent. ""The imposition of these tariffs is not only a blow to our farmers, it's a win for our competitors,"" Kuehl said. ""When American soybean and corn become more expensive, South America wins. When beef becomes more expensive, Australia wins. As this trade war drags on, (US) farmers will rightly question why our competitors are winning while we're losing."" For American farmers, agricultural exports to China are worth almost $20 billion annually. Soybean exports alone account for about $14 billion, according to the US Department of Agriculture. A set of retaliatory tariffs released by China on Friday includes a plan to tax American lobster exports. If the lobster tax comes to pass, it could potentially hurt one of the biggest markets for the premium seafood. The planned tax could have major ramifications for the US seafood industry and for the economy of the state of Maine, which is home to most of the country's lobster business segment. China's interest in US lobsters has grown exponentially in recent years, and exports to China have become a major focus of the business segment. ""Hopefully, better sense will prevail and we'll find a sensible solution,"" said Matt Jacobson, executive director of the Maine Lobster Marketing Collaborative. ""China is a year-round customer. This (news about planned tariffs) isn't good news at all."" China imported $837 million of aquatic products from the US in 2017, up 21.28 percent year-on-year, data from the China Society of Fisheries showed. US automakers, for whom China is a key growth market, are also likely to be hit by bruising tariffs. US auto giant Ford Motor Co sold 338,386 vehicles in China in the first five months this year, about one-third the number in the US. It had welcomed a Chinese plan to lower tariffs on auto imports. It had even planned to cut prices of its imported Lincoln brand of vehicles. That may be in jeopardy now as gas-powered and electric vehicles are due to be slapped with a higher border tax. Wei Jianguo, former vice-minister of commerce, said this move, once taking effect, will further push the US automobile manufacturers out of the Chinese market, as vehicles from Germany, Sweden, France and Japan have already taken the majority proportion of the country's medium and high-end vehicle market. Moreover, Wei said higher tariff on US auto products will also leave more space for domestic car makers to upgrade their product lines by setting up joint ventures, facilitating research activities and acquisitions with European or Japanese companies. Earlier this year, China vowed to further open up the auto market by lowering tariffs on high-end automobiles and through expanding market access. But US auto makers may miss the golden chance to expand their footprints in China, if the Trump administration sticks to trade protectionism and keeps destroying free trade, said Wei."
0,"Beijing's environmental watchdog has vowed to further bolster cross-regional control of air pollution and to better manage pollution sources at a more detailed level as the capital saw continuous improvement of its air quality in 2018. The capital saw the average density of PM2.5 particulate matter drop by about 12 percent year-on-year to 51 micrograms per cubic meter in 2018, said Liu Baoxian, deputy head of the environmental monitoring center at the Beijing Municipal Ecology and Environment Bureau. Liu spoke at a news conference on Friday. Other major air pollutants also decreased. The concentration of sulfur dioxide, for example, stood at 6 mg per cubic meter, down by 25 percent from 2017. Its density remained below 10 mg/cu m, even during the cold months when the increased need for heating can drive up pollution, Liu said. The number of days with heavy pollution in the capital dropped from 58 in 2013 to only 15 last year. The past year also saw 195 consecutive days without heavy air pollution, 108 more than 2013. Shi Aijun, deputy head of Beijing Municipal Research Institute of Environmental Protection, said PM2.5 density in the capital peaked at 244 mg/cu m in 2018, down by 46 percent year-on-year. Xing Jia, associate professor from the School of Environment, Tsinghua University, said their research and calculations showed about half of the capital's air quality improvement in the past five years came from reduction of local emissions. While favorable meteorological conditions contributed 30 percent of the improvement, decrease of pollutant discharges in nearby regions also helped, Xing said. In Hebei province, the PM2.5 concentration dropped 12.5 percent last year, according to preliminary results from the provincial environmental authority. Almost 1.8 million households in the province turned to natural gas and electricity as heating sources instead of highly polluting coal. Almost 6,500 coal-burning boilers with a capacity of about 12,700 metric tons of steam energy were eliminated in 2018. In Beijing, about a third of air pollutants in 2018 were from outside the city, according the Beijing bureau. Among the locally generated pollutants, emissions from vehicles, dust and industrial emissions contributed about 45, 16 and 12 percent, respectively. Though diesel trucks represent only about 4 percent of total internal combustion engines in Beijing, they contributed 90 percent of the particular matter from such engines. Bureau officials said they have taken tailored measures based on their research. While establishing a monitoring network that targets dust, they also are better managing diesel trucks. They say they have weeded out 47,000 such trucks and established a database that includes 145,000 trucks with excessive emissions. Li Kunsheng, head of vehicle emission management, said trucks in the database that are registered in other regions will be forbidden from entering the capital. Li said his department will carry out surprise inspections of those with local plates to ensure owners rectify their violations. Li Xiang, the Beijing authority's director of air pollution management, said that during three decades, the biggest part of their work was reducing coal consumption and shutting down small polluting enterprises. With most of that work completed, Beijing now has to turn to more detailed management to further cut pollution."
1,"China expects no further reversals in its trade and economic ties with the United States, and hopes the two nations can benefit one another, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said on Monday. Lu made the remarks when asked at a regular press conference whether a recent agreement reached between the nations on the subject of trade will be a temporary one. Beijing and Washington issued a joint statement on Saturday about economic and trade consultations, with both vowing not to launch a trade war. ""If the governments of the two countries could reach a good agreement and results that are acceptable to both, they should adhere to the agreement. Of course, we do not want to see any reversal,"" he said. He also said that, based on experience from the past four decades, the fundamental reason why both nations have been able to manage disputes and push forward with the development of bilateral trade has been because such a relationship is in the best interest of both countries and their people. ""We hope that the China-US trade and economic relations, which is mutually beneficial and win-win in nature, could play a more effective role,"" Lu added."
0,"Gearing up for four new events at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, China's top sports body is hoping to draft overseas athletes of Chinese origin to represent their motherland in areas where China lacks athletic prowess. Without enough talent in surfing, climbing, skateboarding and BMX freestyle riding, four sports added for the Tokyo Games, the General Administration of Sport of China has launched a progressive talent selection program to identify and develop athletes from home and abroad. The administration has formed a leading group with the four respective sporting bodies and Beijing Sport University to run the program, which opened an online registration system on Monday to receive applications from Chinese talent at home, foreign athletes of Chinese ancestry and Chinese citizens living abroad.   Online registration on the university's website will be open through Aug 31, followed by an audition and two rounds of qualification tests with a two-month training camp to eventually select 50 athletes for each of the sports by the end of this year. An international experts panel consisting of coaches, physical trainers, nutritionists and psychologists with expertise in the four sports, which are currently underdeveloped in China, will assess and guide the registrants.   The program will reach out to countries with strengths in such ""extreme sports"", such as the United States, Australia and Brazil, to search for established talent with Chinese origins. It would attract them to represent China with stipends and policies on nationality-transfer procedures if necessary, according to the leading group. ""Due to the lack of talent in these niche sports in China, it is the shortcut that we have to take to prepare for Tokyo in such a short period of time,"" said Cao Weidong, director of the leading group and Party chief of Beijing Sport University. ""The reform also is being implemented by overhauling the traditional athletic talent drafting system and by expanding it to the grassroots and extending its reach overseas."" It intends to expand the nation's Olympic prowess beyond traditional strong sports including table tennis, badminton and diving. One example is the Chinese Ice Hockey Association organizing tryout camps in the Canadian cities of Toronto and Vancouver in June to select young players of Chinese ancestry to join the national program through naturalization for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.   ""To channel overseas talent to the national system, with support in policy and logistics, is an experiment of great significance to improve our relatively weak sports quickly,"" said Liu Xiaonong, director of the athletic department of sports administration. However, persuading some excellent overseas talent to abandon foreign citizenship to be eligible to represent China remains a challenge, given that China doesn't accept dual citizenship, observers said. ""Still, strong support within China's State-run sports system will appeal to a certain group of overseas Chinese who couldn't join the mainstream athletic systems in their adopted countries,"" said Zhang Bing, a sports sociology expert at Tsinghua University."

About two decades ago, when Ban Zan was a student at the Central Academy of Drama, one of his favorite playwrights was Ding Xilin (1893-1974). The renowned playwright's major works were written between 1923 and 1940 and concentrate on comedy. ""I was amused by the humorous dialogue, which is witty and implicit. That unique way of being humorous, I believe, belongs to the Chinese people,"" says the 40-year-old actor-turned-director Ban, who joined Beijing People's Art Theatre after he graduated in 2003. Since then, Ban has played roles in plays, such as  and  In 2016, Ban, who also has starred in movies and TV dramas, chose three one-act comedies by the playwright and adapted then into a play. The work, entitled  which premiered in Beijing in April 2016, tells three stories－ and  In the play, three actors from Beijing People's Art Theatre perform nine roles.,Now, after touring the country for the past two years, the play returns to Beijing and is being staged at the Beijing People's Art Theatre through Aug 6. ""The three comedies by Ding showcase different stages of romance: young lovers, newlyweds and elderly couples,"" says Ban, who made his directorial debut in 2015. ""I have been married for nearly eight years, and when I read the three comedies with my wife, we both relate to them and want to share them with the audience. ""Ding's comedies are easy to understand and the plots are simple. So, watching his comedies, you get a wonderful taste that lingers,"" says Ban. Ding, who was born in Taixing, in Jiangsu province, graduated from the University of Birmingham, in the United Kingdom, with a master's degree in physics. During his stay in the UK, Ding became interested in theater and started writing plays. In 1919, after returning to China, Ding taught physics at Peking University, and from 1924 to 1926, he was the dean of the physics department there.,As a playwright, Ding published 10 works. In 1923, he published his first comedy, A Wasp, which tells the story of two young lovers, whose relationship was objected by the young man's mother. Then, in 1925, he published  which was inspired by Ding's friend Ling Shuhua's novel with the same title and follows a newlywed couple who get drunk. written in 1927, portrays an old couple's reflections on their marriage. Speaking about the plays, Ban says: ""Though the three comedies were written in the 1920s and 1930s, they still connect with a contemporary audience. ""We fall in love, get married and deal with being a husband, wife, father-in-law and mother-in-law. ""The language pioneered by Ding became a defining characteristic of spoken drama of the 1920s, and he still inspires people working in theater and audiences."", is part of the 2018 Story in Beijing, a theater festival, which features 20 original Chinese plays and runs between Aug 1 and Sept 1. The highlights include a romantic play, which has been staged more than 3,500 times since its premiere in 2015; Kunqu Opera   by the Northern Kunqu Opera Theater; and a tragic play, Injustice to Tou O, directed by Ding Yiteng and based on Dou E Yuan, a Chinese play written by Guan Hanqing (1241-1320) during the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368). According to Guo Zhuqing from the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture, the organizer of the theater festival, the 20 plays will be staged at small theater venues in the capital: The Star Theater, Beijing National Pioneer Theater and the Tianqiao Performing Arts Center. ""The scope for plays created for smaller theaters is growing fast in China. We've seen a big spurt of creativity and originality from Chinese theater artists,"" says Guo, adding that since the theater festival was born seven years ago, 110 plays have been staged."
1,"Chinese private conglomerate Dalian Wanda Group Co Ltd plans to list its sports arm in the Nasdaq exchange in New York as the company keeps making inroads into the international market and strengthen the operation of its sports business. The Beijing-based Wanda Sports Group holds shares in Infront Sports & Media and the Ironman long-distance triathlon brand, among other top global assets. It filed an application on Friday and aims to raise $500 million through its IPO on the Nasdaq. It will use some of the proceeds to repay loans related to group restructuring, according to its prospectus. As one of the largest sport events and marketing platforms, Wanda Sports posted sales revenue of 1.12 billion euros ($1.23 billion) in 2018, and a profit of 54 million euros. For the three months ended March 31, 2019, the company reported revenue of 245.6 million euros and a loss of 8.6 million euros, the company said in its filing. Since 2015, the giant property developer has been diversifying its portfolio in sports, in addition to film and hotel businesses, by completing a group of high-profile acquisitions of world-class sports assets. It is now a top event organizer in triathlon, mountain biking and running events, the filing said. ""The sports industry is a sunrise industry in China, and despite some challenges, the investment in the sector has been growing. Now, it is a very good timing to strengthen the layout in the sports sector, fueled by the growing demand of Chinese consumers increasingly paying attention to exercising and keeping healthy,"" said An Fuxiu, founder of Sportbank, a Beijing-based sports industry consultancy. ""Wanda Sports has helped many global events to launch in China, such as the Ironman race. The group could become more internationalized by potentially listing its sports assets. Sports is a good path that will help Chinese enterprises and brands to become major players in the global market,"" she said. Chinese billionaire Wang Jianlin, chairman of Wanda Group, said in 2016 the sports industry will be a new growth point in the next decade in the country. Wanda Sports aims to go public ultimately and become the first sports company with annual sales revenues of over $10 billion globally. In 2015, Wanda completed a $650 million merger with World Triathlon Corp. Later, it bought Swiss sports marketing group Infront Sports& Media for 1.05 billion euros. The global sports media and events market is projected to grow to 224 billion euros in 2022 from 179 billion euros in 2018, representing a compound annual growth rate of about 5.9 percent, the prospectus said."
1,"Despite the convention that October is the peak season for property trading, property prices in the nation's major cities remained stable, and pre-owned home prices in top-tier cities declined month-on-month, National Bureau of Statistics data showed on Thursday. Local governments maintained their grip on property speculation, implementing tailored measures in accordance with their own conditions. The tightening moves have helped the property market return to rational levels as the October figure showed new home price growth was slower month-on-month and pre-owned home prices in first-tier cities started to decline, said Liu Jianwei, a senior statistician at the NBS. New home prices in the first-tier Chinese cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen remained unchanged in October compared to September, while their pre-owned home prices edged down by an average of 0.2 percent month-on-month, according to the NBS index that tracks home price changes in the nation's 70 major cities. Among the 70 cities surveyed by the NBS, 31 tier-two cities, mostly provincial capitals, saw new home prices rise 1 percent and pre-owned home prices increased by 0.3 percent from the previous month. This narrowed the growth rates by 0.1 and 0.5 percentage point respectively from September. Meanwhile, 35 tier-three cities saw their new home prices increase 1.1 percent and pre-owned home prices rise by 0.5 percent from the previous month. ""The new home price index of the 70 cities grew 1 percent month-on-month on average, and rose 9.7 percent year-on-year. This may have something to do with the fact that we are in a traditional peak season for property trading,"" said Yan Yuejin, director of Shanghai-based E-house China Research and Development Institution. ""Compared to August and September, a distinctive characteristic of October was that house prices in the secondary market showed signs of softening, with 14 cities reporting a drop,"" said Zhang Dawei, chief analyst at Centaline Property Agency Ltd. Xiamen in Fujian province reported a 0.9 percent month-on-month decline, followed by Shenzhen with 0.6 percent, while Hangzhou and Ningbo, both in Zhejiang province, saw declines of 0.4 and 0.3 percent, respectively. The first-tier cities of Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou reported that their pre-owned home prices fell 0.2 percent each compared with the previous month. ""Compared to new homes, pre-owned home prices better reflect the market situation,"" said Zhang. Pre-owned home transactions account for more than half of the total home trading volume in major first and second-tier Chinese cities, and that figure could exceed 80 percent in Beijing and Shanghai."
0,"Beijing -- A survey showed that most Chinese children and adolescents hold a positive impression of Confucius, the China Youth Daily reported Thursday. The survey, made by the Chinese National Academy of Arts, polled 1,248 students from 12 primary schools and middle schools in Beijing and Hebei Province. Ren Hui, who is in charge of the survey, said that most respondents held positive views on both the excellent traditional Chinese culture and Confucius. They also showed a keen interest in the ancient sage, which indicates the shaping of Confucius' image is successful. More than 50 percent of the respondents said Confucius-themed videos and audio works should be serious while about 30 percent wanted more humorous works. About 10 percent of those interviewed wished to see Confucius-themed works about time travel. About 20 films, television and stage works themed on Confucius have been shown to the public over the past four decades, the survey said. The survey also revealed that adolescents have a high demand for audiovisual materials about traditional culture, and they are more likely to learn about Confucius via audiovisual works than books. About 40 percent of the respondents are most interested in stories about Confucius' life and childhood, the survey said. Ren called on arts workers to produce more innovative works about Confucius on the basis of thorough research into his experience at a young age and in consideration of children's needs."
0,"Beijing will establish an institution this year to oversee after-school centers, the capital's Education Commission announced. It will be the first such institution in China. A special law enforcement team will be set up in every district of the capital to better supervise the centers and strengthen inspections, the commission said. The names of institutions that do not pass inspections will be made public, according to the commission. Xiong Bingqi, deputy director of the 21st Century Education Research Institute in Beijing, said the move will improve education. ""Many requirements stipulated by the Compulsory Education Law are ignored by local education institutions and it's hard to track their responsibilities,"" he said. ""The establishment of certain law enforcement departments will solve those problems."" Chen Baosheng, minister of education, said on Tuesday that 401,000 institutions nationwide had been assessed during a national campaign targeting unlicensed operators and extracurricular programs that put students under too much pressure, and more than 273,000 were found to have problems. He added that around 98.9 percent of the problematic institutions had been rectified. Some after-school institutions have moved their classes online to avoid government inspection, Chen added. Ni Minjing, deputy director of the Shanghai Education Commission, said that one of the major obstacles to rectifying the problems with after-school training institutions is that there are no special law enforcement teams and a lack of law enforcement rights. In 2016, the Ministry of Education encouraged municipal and county education departments to improve accountability. ""However, a lack of legislation impeded the performance,"" Xiong said. He also said that public involvement is necessary in conducting inspections to encourage parents to actively participate in finding solutions. A local regulation regarding administrative enforcement will be submitted to the capital's top legislature later this year, according to the capital's Education Commission. The commencement date for the capital's law enforcement teams has not been settled."

The long holiday is a good travel opportunity for Chinese people. The China National Tourism Administration (CNTA) said on the fifth day of the holiday that 93 million tourists traveled around the country. In Beijing, many who chose to travel by car left the city at midnight or in the early morning.

1,"Imagine a box with four wheels, cruising down the street without a steering wheel or an accelerator pedal. In Chen Jiadong's unromantic vision, that's what driverless cars will be like. But the 32-year-old worker, a car-racing fan, believes driverless vehicles will not spoil the fun of driving. ""Driving all the day is so tiring. If cars can drive themselves in line with rules, then traffic accidents may be reduced and efficiency can be improved,"" he said. Chen's wish is not far out of reach. Chinese companies are racing against rivals to mass produce autonomous vehicles, as the government is said to be expediting rules and regulations. Nearly one-third of the more than 30 firms getting permission to conduct self-driving road tests in California, the United States, are from China, according to the California Department of Motor Vehicles. Many of these companies are startups, including Drive.ai, JingChi Corp, Pony.ai, TuSimple and Nuro. Internet giant Baidu Inc is also one of these players, and Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp is the only traditional vehicle company. It's widely believed in the auto and technology industry that commercial usage of self-driving vehicles will come to fruition in 2020. But Chinese firms may be two years ahead of the global target. Baidu plans to launch ""small-scale production"" of fully autonomous mini-buses this July, according to Robin Li, CEO of the Chinese tech giant. ""The monitoring system developed by Baidu can monitor whether a driver is tired or not. If the driver is tired, the system will issue a warning and perk up the driver with a cheerful song,"" Li said during a conference. Startup JingChi Corp plans to deploy the first fleet of 50 self-driving taxis in Anqing, East China's Anhui province by this March. Customers could order self-driving taxis through a ride-hailing app, and during the test period, the cab will have a ""safety officer"" in the driver's seat, said Wang Jing, founder and CEO of JingChi. ""As the government gradually shapes policies and regulations of automated vehicles and more passengers get used to the service, we would consider removing the safety officer in the future,"" Wang said. Backed by venture capital, more and more companies are jumping on the bandwagon. Momenta, a Beijing-based firm providing road sensors and high definition mapping software, received $46 million of funding in July 2017. TuSimple, an autonomous truck startup that develops technology for autonomous long-distance freight delivery, raised $55 million in November 2017. The companies' devotion to the revolutionary technologies was shored up by Chinese consumers' enthusiasm, as well as the government's positive attitude. More than 60 percent of survey respondents in China believe their families will be riding in autonomous cars in the future, said a recent report by management consulting firm McKinsey & Co. China aims to install driver-assistant systems or partly autonomous driving systems to more than 50 percent of new vehicles by 2020, and to produce highly and fully autonomous cars for the market by 2025. That's according to a development plan for the automobile industry jointly issued in April 2017 by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, and the National Development and Reform Commission, China's top economic regulator. Nevertheless, there is still a long way to go before self-driving vehicles enter large-scale commercial operation. ""I'd like to have a try when driverless taxis hit the road, but the premise is that the car is safe,"" said Yin Nan, 38, who works with a nonprofit organization. ""If an accident happens, who will be responsible for that?"" Yin's nagging doubt was not groundless. One of the biggest problems for driverless cars is that hackers may enter the vehicles' operating system, according to Deng Feng, co-founder of Northern Light Venture Capital. ""Technological hurdles may include the accuracy of digital maps and the high cost of producing light detection and ranging devices－laser-sensing 'eyes' used in self-driving car systems,"" said Zhao Xiang, a senior analyst at Beijing-based internet consultancy Analysys. Still, it is the permissiveness of regulations, rather than technologies, that will set the pace of the commercial use of this technology, Deng Feng said. ""It's difficult to predict the timeline of driverless vehicles' mass production. Some Chinese companies are getting ready to wheel out their vehicles, but the schedule may be delayed due to regulation issues rather than technology lag,"" he said on the sidelines of a recent tech summit organized in Beijing by media outlet ifeng.com. To speed up the development of the self-driving technology, the government has been drafting relevant guidelines and regulations. In mid-December 2017, the country's first guideline on road tests of autonomous motor vehicles was released by local authorities in Beijing. The guideline makes it clear that independent entities registered in China can apply to test at most five vehicles at a time, and they must first complete tests in designated closed zones before conducting road tests. The list of road sections eligible for such tests will soon be released, according to the Beijing local authorities. Later that month, the Ministry of Transport said that it would conduct research to promulgate policies related to autonomous driving technology this year. When making related laws and regulations, many issues need to be taken into consideration, said Gao Yifei, a professor from Southwest University of Political Science and Law. ""For example, how to ensure the security and reliability of self-driving vehicles? What will happen after autonomous vehicles are driven on the road? What if driverless vehicles cannot recognize gestures of traffic police?"" Kuang Ziping, founding managing partner of the Shanghai-based Qiming Venture Partners, said the industry expects favorable policies will be carried out soon. ""All in all, the government authorities, both at the national and local levels, are supportive of self-driving vehicles,"" Kuang said."
1,"Chinese direct investment in the US totaled $1.8 billion between January and May. That's a 92 percent drop compared to the same period in 2017, and the lowest level in seven years, according to a report released Wednesday by Rhodium Group, a US research firm which tracks Chinese direct investment in the US. Another survey carried out by China General Chamber of Commerce-USA showed that 44 percent of respondents see deterioration in China-US economic and trade relations in 2018. And the same proportion believe that a stable and healthy relationship between the two countries is extremely important to the success of their company's business in the US. The CGCC 2018 Annual Business Survey Report was released in Washington on Wednesday. Foreign direct investment from China to the United States declined 30 percent in 2017 compared to a record high in 2016, according to the CGCC report. ""It's clear that the US-China relationship is facing incremental challenges. And perhaps even roadblocks for further development and co-operation,"" said Xu Chen, chairman of the CGCC and president of Bank of China USA. Xu said that Chinese companies operating in the US have ""bought American-made products, created American jobs, benefited American communities and paid American taxes."" It is the fifth consecutive year the CGCC has conducted its annual business survey on Chinese enterprises in the US. This year's survey was carried out in March 2018 and included a total of 249 responses, an increase of 17 percent over last year. ""In terms of the trade tensions, we haven't seen any real effect from that yet. Of course it's going to be a negative effect,"" said Daniel J. McQuade, group president of AECOM Construction Services. Respondents were especially concerned with high tariffs on imports (60 percent) and the prospect of tighter senior executive work visas and immigration policies (63 percent). Concerns are rising among Chinese executives in the US about the tone and temperament of relations between China, the US, and their respective companies. More than 40 percent of respondents expressed concern about accusations of intellectual property theft or cyber attacks, and 25 percent by the nativist ""Buy American, Hire American"" rhetoric. According to the survey, nearly 60 percent of respondents said the headcount of their workforce rose in 2017, despite the trade tensions. The same percentage expects to increase their workforce in the next two years — with two-thirds anticipating an increase of at least 10 percent. Jeff Zhao, vice-president of BeijingWest Industries, said that recruiting talent was not easy for his company. Steve Tan, president of China Telecom Americas, said that hiring talent was not a problem for them. Looking to the future, 48 percent of respondents are optimistic about the US commercial environment over the next three years, and only 11 percent are pessimistic. ""I think it's going to be still like that for the next 6-12 months,"" said Shau Zhang, partner and market leader of Ernst & Young's Americas China Overseas Investment Network. ""We want Chinese investors in Kentucky,"" said Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin. ""We can not be an island unto ourselves here in America,"" Bevin added. ""We need each other. We want each other… and investment makes everything fall in line."" The business community should be unified to address their needs, suggested Michael McDonough, chief economist at Bloomberg. ""If businesses coming together saying this is the right policy, this is something we should do, I think we can go a long way to influence what's happening here over the course of next couple of years,"" he said."
1,"Beijing Capital International Airport Co Ltd has seen significant revenue growth from its non-aviation income, thanks to the booming business of duty-free stores, driven by a constantly growing number of international travelers and their strong spending power. In the first half of this year, the airport netted sales revenues of 4.61 billion yuan ($700 million), an 8.8 percent increase year-on-year. Of that total, non-aviation income reached 2.16 billion yuan, jumping 13.5 percent over the previous period, according to its latest earnings report. The airport said in its report that income growth of the non-aviation sector mainly comes from the growth of duty-free retailing business. In addition, income from advertising and catering has also helped to boost the airport's revenue growth. The increasing number of international travelers has resulted in the launch of more brands and stores, it said. This year, the Chinese government started to allow airports to run open tenders for duty-free concessions. By June 30, the tender result released and showed that China Duty Free Group won the bid of running duty-free stores at the airport's Terminal 2, and Sunrise Duty Free won the bid of Terminal 3. Both companies will get the management rights for eight years. Under the new agreements, duty-free operators at Beijing airport will share about half of their sales revenues with the airport operator, compared with 20 percent earlier. ""With the constant increase of Chinese tourists who travel abroad, it's very necessary to launch more duty-free stores at those airports in major and second-tier cities,"" said Zhu Weilong, an analyst at Kent Ridge Consulting. ""Those consumers who fly abroad and fly back have the shopping demand and abilities. There is a significant growth potential of the duty-free business at the airports in China."" By 2020, the number of outbound travelers is expected to exceed 200 million, surging 63.9 percent over 2016, according to the forecast of China National Tourism Administration. Meanwhile, the Hong Kong-listed Beijing Capital International Airport achieved net profits of 1.26 billion yuan in the first half, surging 39.6 percent year-on-year. Japan's Daiwa Institute of Research Group said in its report that Beijing Capital International Airport performed outstandingly in the first half year. For the full year, it has raised its forecast of the earnings per share for 12 to 13 percent. For 2019, Daiwa cut its forecast of the earnings per share for 8 percent, as it expects the new Beijing airport facility is likely to have an impact on the performance of the old capital airport. In the first half of 2017, 291,431 flights took off and landed at Beijing Capital International Airport, a 2.11 percent dip year-on-year. During the period, the passenger throughput reached 46,626,794, edging up 2.28 percent over the previous period."
1,"China's food delivery apps Meituan and Ele.me denied eavesdropping on customers through mobile phone microphones to provide targeted ads, said Beijing Daily on Tuesday. Some media earlier reported that the two food delivery giants can suggest precisely food or restaurants to customers after customers talk about it, which aroused suspicion that the apps were programmed to listen to audio through phone's microphone without permission. Meituan said the app only uses the phone's microphone when the users start speech input, adding it does not do eavesdropping. Ele.me said the app doesn't have such eavesdropping programming and the company doesn't own the related technology to implement it. Any information is collected after the users agree to it, added Ele.me."
1,"With a bunch of smartphone-based apps enabling people to rent a wide range of items, China is embracing a new age of business and convenience. Buoyed by successful startups such as bike-sharing giant Ofo Inc and ride-hailing titan Didi Chuxing, the tide of the sharing economy is sweeping across China, helping transform the country into a global innovation leader, expanding business far more rapidly than its foreign counterparts. The magical sharing mode is being used to rent an ever-growing list of items. Bicycles, homes, car rides, everyday clothing, basketballs, umbrellas ... by simply scanning the QR codes in stations via their smartphones or logging on the apps or mini sites of Tencent Holdings Ltd's WeChat platform, users can conveniently access almost anything they need in major cities. Nationwide, sharing economy transactions were worth about 3.45 trillion yuan ($522.8 billion) in 2016, according to a report jointly released by the State Information Center and the Internet Society of China. Seeing the big potential for new business, the Chinese government expects to grow the transactions of sharing economy by 40 percent year-on-year over the next few years. By 2020, it is expected to account for more than 10 percent of China's gross domestic product. China's GDP was 74.41 trillion yuan last year and is projected to grow 6-7 percent annually over the next few years. In June, the central government approved a guideline to boost the booming sharing economy. The guideline encouraged entrepreneurs to start businesses related to the sharing economy, and the authorities will gradually remove the industrial and regional barriers to its sustainable development. Shared self-service mini-gyms are the new trend on the increasing list of sharable services. For around 6 yuan per half hour, users are able to rent mini-gym booths in nearby residential neighborhoods for exercise and bodybuilding. Since June this year, the shared booths, which resemble phone booths, have been rolled out in communities in Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou of Zhejiang province, Shenzhen of Guangdong province and Nanjing of Jiangsu province. Covering around five square meters of space, the self-service shared booths are equipped with basic fitness equipment such as a treadmill, air conditioner, air purifier and a high-definition screen to listen to music or watch videos. After paying the needed deposit, users can then book the nearest booth to head to and scan the access code with smartphones. Bi Zhen, CEO of Beijing-based fitness startup Misspao, said the self-service pods actually cater to people's increasing need for sports and exercise. ""Our company's survey revealed that 95 percent of the investigated people need exercise, while only 10 percent of them have the gym membership. Due to the heavy workload, many of them lack time to take exercise frequently. And that's exactly what we can offer. Even busy people can enjoy the convenience brought by the private fitness booths in the residential communities,"" Bi said. The company said the cost per fitness pod is around 10,000 yuan to 15,000 yuan, and the company can earn 60 yuan per machine per day. That means it can yield high rates of return, with break-even in six to eight months. The company has raised a total number of around 100 million yuan investment, including the latest 75 million yuan series A round of financing. According to Bi, the company has signed up more than 2,000 residential communities domestically and placed more than 200 self-service fitness booths. And it is expected to roll out 3,000 pods in 10 cities nationwide before the next Spring Festival in February. The shared fitness booths service is part of the broader sharing-economy boom sweeping across China and integrating into existing industry. Fueled by supportive government policies and blossoming internet technologies such as mobile payments, new sharing products will gradually pop up across the country to cater to people's growing need for high-quality lives. Zhang Xu, a Beijing-based internet analyst, said as China's great demographic dividend begins to disappear, it is important to develop new economy to cut overcapacity and generate sustainable long-term growth. ""Sharing economy will innovate the way traditional industry works, as the new type of economy will gradually transform the former one,"" Zhang added."
0,"Beijing slammed irresponsible remarks on Monday that Washington made over a United Nations senior official's visit to the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, saying the United States is not in a position to criticize normal cooperation between China and the organization. On Friday, US Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan spoke with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres ""to convey deep concerns"" about the trip made to Xinjiang by Vladimir Voronkov, under-secretary-general of UN Counter-Terrorism Office. Sullivan said it was ""highly inappropriate"", Reuters reported. ""Washington's groundless accusations on China and the UN are futile,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said at a daily news briefing. Voronkov visited Beijing and Xinjiang from Thursday to Saturday and met with senior diplomats including Vice-Foreign Minister Le Yucheng and Assistant Foreign Minister Zhang Jun, the ministry said. His visit was a success and enhanced counterterrorism cooperation between China and the UN, Lu said, adding that the UN also commended the visit. The US does not want to hear any fair and objective voices from the international community on the situation in Xinjiang, which is nothing new, the spokesman said. China has repeatedly stated its solemn stance on Xinjiang-related affairs, and the US is slandering Beijing's policies and legitimate measures on Xinjiang and interfering in the country's domestic affairs, Lu said. ""Washington demands Beijing explain its deradicalization measures in Xinjiang, but when China opens its door and invites UN officials to visit the region, the US criticizes the visit as highly inappropriate. Such practices are extremely hypocritical and make no sense,"" he added. Chinese, Philippine fishing boats collide Beijing said on Monday it will continue to thoroughly and carefully investigate the collision of Chinese and Philippine boats in the South China Sea, and handle the incident properly with Manila based on facts and in a cooperative and friendly manner. A Chinese fishing boat and a Philippine fishing boat accidentally collided on June 10 near Liyue Tan, a shallow-water region in the South China Sea, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said. Conveying consolation to the Philippine fishermen who experienced the collision, Lu emphasized the collision was an accident, and said China and the Philippines have communicated several times about the incident. ""It is not appropriate to link the incident to the friendly feelings between the two countries' people or the ties between the two countries or to even politicize the incident,"" Lu said. China hopes to strengthen communication with the Philippines to exchange what they have found in their own investigations and find out exactly what happened, he said. Fishermen from the two countries have been getting along well in the South China Sea and have been looking out for each other, the spokesman said, adding that China attaches great importance to maritime security and will continue to strengthen cooperation with countries in the region."
1,"Zhejiang province's Wuzhen water town has been gaining global acclaim as a hub for technological innovation that's pushing internet development into the future - but its periphery is also increasing its profile as a rural destination hailing to the old days. Shanghai resident Cheng Jingru says she was struck by photos of rape-flower fields, tree houses and gardens brimming with vegetables when she was skimming the official website of Wucun, a village to the east of the town's Xizha scenic area. ""The photos reminded me of growing up in the countryside,"" she says. Nostalgia enticed her to book an all-inclusive package at a resort in the village. The itinerary includes working in the fields, feeding the livestock and strolling along country roads while enjoying local snacks. ""I want my 7-year-old son to experience the farming life his mother grew up with about two decades ago,"" the 36-year-old says. The resort-like attraction that developed in the natural village, Hongqiao, on the ancient Grand Canal that connects Beijing to the provincial capital, Hangzhou, opened as a tourism destination in early 2016. Villagers had relocated from their old-style houses to modern apartments that the local government had built near the main entrance of the settlement. ""We've preserved and restored these old buildings,"" 29-year-old village chief Li Yuan says. They've been converted into guesthouses according to seven themes, including granary, mill and fishermen's home, he says. ""Visitors can engage in agricultural practices according to the themes,"" Li explains. ""For instance, they can learn how to make tofu in guesthouses with the mill theme."" Farmers in straw hats work the land year-round, ploughing, fertilizing and harvesting golden rice paddies. ""We want to become a tranquil village where people can see how farmers work and join them,"" he says. ""Urbanites can eat fresh vegetables they've picked or fish they've caught themselves."" They can also use the Wuzhen Travel app to find scenic spots, entertainment facilities, stores, restaurants and even bathrooms. The destination has proved particularly popular among families. Wucun hosts over 180 rooms that accommodate 150,000 visitors a year, Li says. A large hall with a conical roof has been built on the water and will be used as an art center for staging cultural performances. The resort has boosted employment, especially among elderly residents who haven't migrated like 65-year-old Lu Yinbao. She can conveniently commute between the village and her apartment, she says. And she has a stable income, unlike in the past, when it depended on harvests that varied from year to year. ""I used to work the land before Hongqiao village turned into Wucun,"" she says. ""I'm still doing what I used to do here. But I'm earning 20,000 yuan ($2,900) a year now."""

During these trips, the students were exposed to the rich cultural traditions passed down through the generations, especially those of the Miao ethnic group. Their works inspired by these fruitful trips will be displayed at two upcoming exhibitions in Beijing, both titled . The first show will open at the Today Art Museum on Sept 8, while the other will take place at Prince Kung's Palace Museum on Sept 23. The works being shown introduce the rich variety of Miao culture — their music, embroidery, cuisine and sacrificial ceremonies — to urban audiences, while the artists' contemporary interpretation of these traditions also give them a second life."
0,"Haidian district in Beijing, home to technology hub Zhongguancun, has become a pioneer of scientific and technology innovation for China during the 40 years since the start of the country's reform and opening-up. Nearly 40 unicorn companies－startups worth more than $1 billion－in addition to 300 listed firms and 20,000 high-tech companies are located in Haidian, which at 594 billion yuan ($85.6 billion) had the highest GDP of the 16 districts in the capital last year. Since 2016, Haidian has been contributing the most to the city in terms of economic growth. ""Once we returned to China after graduating from colleges in the US, the first place we thought of to set up our company was Haidian,"" said Lin Fan, who leads a team on artificial intelligence applications research. Lin said Haidian's top talent, great innovation facilities and government policies helped him and his team choose the district as the starting location of its business dreams. In the past few years, Haidian has been carrying out various preferential policies for science and technology innovation. It has been investing increasingly to attract companies to set up offices and to support research and innovation centers. An innovation fund co-invested by the district government, private companies and a natural science fund－the first of its kind in Beijing－will invest 30 million yuan this year to help innovation research teams. ""We hope that our government can share more of the startup risks at their early stage, including fundamental research, proof of concept, incubation and bringing the product to market,"" said Yu Jun, Party chief of Haidian district. He said the government will provide a full chain of services to support research teams and startups. ""Starting from this year, we plan to select 20 projects annually from the public and provide a subsidy of up to 500,000 yuan each to support early stage research,"" he said. ""At the same time, we will invite scientists, business leaders and investors to be mentors for those projects."" Seeing modern office buildings and high-tech centers in Haidian, especially in the Zhongguancun area, it's hard to imagine that decades ago, the place was full of crowded electronics wholesale markets. The district started reconstruction in 2010. According to the Haidian district government, the western Zhongguancun area has removed 600,000 square meters of electronics wholesale markets and consumer areas and introduced 59 incubators such as innovation workplaces and six unicorn companies including Ofo, NIO and Rong360. Ding Zhe, 43, a Beijinger who used to live in Haidian, said there were not too many companies in the district when he was young. ""It has been growing rapidly, especially in the past eight years, as innovation became the economic driver in the area,"" he said. ""I still remember the time I bought computer components and made one by myself in Zhongguancun. It's totally different now, but I like how it's going."""
0,"Chinese composer and conductor Tan Dun, who won the Oscar for the original score of the movie Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, has always been ahead of the curve. Tan, a native of Changsha, Hunan province, was trained at the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing. Despite his classical training, Tan has created music with the sounds of water, wind and paper. He has also documented nyushu, an ancient language used mostly by women in Hunan. Now, he is collaborating with folk musicians of the China National Traditional Orchestra to present his works－the Fire Ritual Violin Concerto and the Cello Concerto Crouching Tiger and Hidden Dragon－at the capital's National Center for the Performing Arts on Friday. Tan says the idea was inspired by his trip to Dunhuang, Gansu province, three years ago, where he saw the famous cave paintings. ""Big orchestras, musicians and various instruments were displayed in those large paintings, which told me how diverse Chinese music was thousands of years ago,"" says Tan, adding that he wants to reinterpret ancient scores with the help of a modern orchestra to connect the old and the new. Norwegian violinist Eldbjorg Hemsing, who will perform in the Fire Ritual Violin Concerto, says: ""Tan Dun's vision is not to introduce China to the world but to introduce the world to China."" Using the classical violin with an orchestra of traditional Chinese instruments is not known to have been done here before, she says. She calls the concert ""a truly special event"".,  In 2010, Hemsing met Tan for the first time at his studio in Shanghai, where she had gone to play in Tan's violin concerto inspired by Peking Opera, with the Trondheim Symphony Orchestra under his baton. ""I remember one very specific question he asked me: 'What is your feeling and perception about the piece?' He wanted to hear what my thoughts were and how I'd interpret it,"" Hemsing recalls. The foundation of how they work together is still openness and curiosity, she adds. Fire Ritual, which premiered in Beijing in 1997, was one of Tan's concertos for huqin, a two-stringed bowed instrument. According to the composer, Hemsing will play the violin in a manner similar to how the Chinese instruments erhu (a bowed instrument) and guqin (Chinese zither) are played. The orchestra members will be arranged across the stage and the audience will be seated in a way that will resemble royal performances during the Tang Dynasty (618-907). The Cello Concerto Crouching Tiger and Hidden Dragon is based on Tan's Oscar-winning score, which was performed by cellist Yo-Yo Ma, for the Ang Lee film.,Tan says he composed the Cello Concerto Crouching Tiger and Hidden Dragon for the violin and cello in the style of traditional Chinese folk music. ""It's almost like a conversation between the China National Traditional Orchestra and Western musical instruments,"" he says. Tan says he hopes to inspire people's imaginations with classical music. He will also present his compositions Passacaglia: Secret of Wind and Birds and Internet Symphony Eroica at the NCPA on Friday. Passacaglia premiered in 2015. It takes inspiration from the ancient and the modern, the East and the West, and from nature and man-made objects. Tan has incorporated the chirping of birds produced by phones. ""The symphony orchestra is expanding with the inclusion of new instruments. I thought the cellphone ... might be a wonderful new instrument that reflects our lives today,"" Tan says. The Internet Symphony Eroica features videos of some 3,000 musicians from more than 70 countries. Tan did the rehearsal with musicians online across the world. The project was presented at Carnegie Hall in 2009. ""The internet is an invisible Silk Road, joining different cultures around the world,"" says Tan. 7:30 pm, Friday.

1,"Expanding the subway and bike lane networks should help reduce gridlock in downtown Beijing, but authorities do not expect to see major improvements in traffic flow in 2018, information released over the weekend suggests. The city aims to maintain a level of 5.7 on the traffic index this year, meaning ""mild congestion"", Rong Jun, a spokesman for the Beijing Transport Commission, said on Saturday during Beijing's ongoing two sessions. The index for the past two years has been 5.6. He said the government will release a plan containing multiple measures for tackling traffic jams after the annual meetings of the city's top legislature and advisory bodies, which end on Tuesday. ""The city will continue to accelerate construction of the subway, with an aim to increase the total length from 608 to 632 kilometers, as well as improve 900 km of bicycle lanes,"" Rong said. ""We expect 73 percent of commuters will travel by public transportation this year,"" he added, an increase of 1 percentage point on 2017. Rong said the government will also adopt a mechanism to assess how a proposed project could affect an area's traffic flow in order to prevent congestion. ""In Tongzhou district, the city's subcenter, the authorities are already taking measures to ensure clear traffic. Citywide, we're also regulating roadside parking,"" he said. A senior source with the Transport Commission, who asked not to be identified, predicted on Saturday the average commute in Beijing would be cut to only about 30 minutes once municipal departments begin relocating to Tongzhou. According to an earlier plan, Beijing's Party committee, city government, people's congress and political consultative conference were expected to move from downtown to suburban Lucheng area by the end of 2017. So far, the project has not started, and no revised time frame has been announced. However, once the work is completed, companies and small businesses will follow to provide employment opportunities and services to the shifting population, which will have a knock-on effect to downtown traffic, the senior source said. A report by tech giant Tencent and ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing ranked Beijing top among 50 Chinese cities for commuting distance and time. The average commute in the capital covers 19.2 km and lasts 52 minutes. By comparison, the average in Chicago in the United States is 32.4 minutes, according to a survey by Auto Accessories Garage, an online retailer. The average in New York City is 29.5 minutes. In the Chinese capital, people often live far from their workplace due to the high cost of real estate in central areas. As the city has expanded, the commute for many people has become longer. The Tencent-Didi report said most travel is from Huilongguan, Tiantongyuan, Tongzhou, Daxing and Yanjiao in neighboring Hebei province. All of these places are outside of the capital's Fifth Ring Road. Wu Jie, 32, travels nearly 60 km every weekday from his home in northern Tiantongyuan to his work at a transportation company in southwestern Fangshan district. It is a round trip of about four hours. ""I hope the traffic will be better when more people move to Tongzhou, so I don't have to spend so much time on the road,"" he said. dujuan@chinadaily.com.cn"

0,"In many people's minds, there exist two ways to discover picturesque Jiangnan, on the southern bank of Yangtze River. One is to view the landscape in real life and the other is to view the paintings of the late modern master Wu Guanzhong. Wu, a native of Yixing, Jiangsu province, in the heart Jiangnan, recreated the natural beauty of the region he had been familiar with since childhood in such a way that it evokes a poetic resonance in a viewer, rendering his works with a classic charm. Two paintings from Wu's Jiangnan landscape series will go under the hammer in Beijing on Thursday as part of a sale by Poly International Auction. Both titled Twin Swallows, the paintings are of the same size and present the same composition, but in different mediums: one is a classic Chinese ink piece completed in 1988 and the other is oil on canvas, and was completed six years later. The two works, both 70 by 140 centimeters, depict the same serene scene, in which a couple of swallows fly over a stretch of riverside and houses built in a typical Jiangnan architectural style.,The composition looks as simple as one can find in many landscapes of Wu's oeuvre. It is divided into three parts, the reflective water, the rectangular residential buildings and the gloomy sky-in which one could easily miss the two flying swallows whose size is relatively small compared with the paintings' other subjects. The color palette of the two pictures is light. Wu smeared the river and the sky with a subtle degree of gray and, at the center of the paintings, he outlined several conjunctive white walls, a distinctive feature of the Jiangnan architecture. He only dabbed some green, red and yellow on a tree standing by the river, bringing about the only vibrant aspect to an overall sad or serene effect that engulfs the two paintings. According to Wang Luxiang, a researcher at China National Academy of Painting in Beijing, Wu began exploring the Jiangnan motif after he attended classes given by art professors of the former Soviet Union in Beijing, in the early 1950s. Wu, a graduate of oil painting at the prestigious National High School of Fine Arts in Paris, then taught at the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing. Wang says Wu had heard the Soviet-era lecturers say that Jiangnan was not a suitable subject for oil painting, because, unlike Europe, it rained heavily throughout the year in the region, thus the architecture and the views were drab, and it was difficult to distinguish the land and the sky, both awash with gray. ""In much disbelief, Wu began traveling frequently to Jiangnan from the 1960s onward,"" Wang says. ""He sketched and experimented. He wanted to find an approach to depict the poetry and elegance unique to Jiangnan that could be presented in both Chinese and Western forms."" Wu finally found it after a two-decade effort. ""He succeeded in choosing a grayish silver as the dominant tone of his palette. He was inspired after his long gazes at local houses. ""He also found in the structure of these buildings the clean-cut combination of dots and lines. His paintings show a brilliant combination of a lot of lines, large areas of white space and dots, with reduced details,"" Wang says. The greatness of Wu's Jiangnan landscapes is that he was able to balance sense and sensibility by juxtaposing the energy of nature and the power of man-made structures and forms, he adds."
0,"The children are ages 2 to 14, and their classroom always smells of disinfectant. They all wear masks. Few have hair, but those who do have just a few thin strands. They all have leukemia. Every year, about 15,000 children in China are diagnosed with leukemia, a form of cancer caused by overproduction of damaged white blood cells. Most are ages 2 to 7, and their treatment usually lasts two to three years. In addition to enduring the pain of bone marrow treatments and chemotherapy, their immune systems are impaired, leaving the children at risk of infection, so they have to say goodbye to a normal life. The disease confines them to hospital wards or home, isolating them from the outside world. At Peking University First Hospital in downtown Beijing, 80 percent of the child patients with leukemia come from other parts of China. To help them continue their studies, the Beijing New Sunshine Charity Foundation has cooperated with the hospital to run a free school since 2012. The classroom, a public space in a corridor, welcomes children of all ages. Generally, a full-time teacher and student volunteers give two classes every week, each lasting 90 minutes. Courses at the ""corridor classroom"" include Chinese, math, English, arts, health and science. The idea was inspired by Zuo Yan from Anhui province. When the then-8-year-old was diagnosed with aplastic anemia a decade ago, the foundation sponsored his treatment in Beijing. Volunteers found a picture he had drawn of his school days that carried the caption, ""I miss school."" That set the idea in motion.,""I realized these children were very eager to keep learning,"" said Liu Zhengchen, who was diagnosed with leukemia when he was a university student. In 2001, he founded the foundation to help children with the disease. However, Liu and his team have discovered that it can be difficult to teach the children. Some close themselves off from other people and rarely speak. Others are restless and uncooperative, and they are always crying. Understandably, most parents are indulgent with their children. ""I don't know how long his life will last. I'll try my best to make him happy,"" said one father. However, instead of pandering excessively to the children, Liu insists that the teachers treat them like regular students. If children have behavioral problems in class, he guides them to rectify the situation immediately. ""After they recover, they will eventually go back to school and their communities. Then, nobody will care about the doctors in the way their parents and doctors do now,"" Liu said. ""We want to help them fight the disease, but we also expect them to have the ability to deal with normal life."",Yu Maoyuan comes from Guizhou province in Southwest China. The 4-year-old was diagnosed with leukemia two months ago and was referred to doctors in Beijing ""for better treatment"". On March 18, she attended the class for the first time. The lesson showed how to make a ""telephone"" with string and two paper cups. Teacher Liu Weixiong used the simple experiment to explain the movement of sound waves to the children. At first, Yu was timid. She lowered her head and leaned on her mother. She did not say anything, but followed the teachers' instructions. ""She didn't want to go, so I took her to the class,"" said Yu's mother, who was encouraged by the student volunteers. ""My daughter hasn't gone to kindergarten for a long time."" The illness has changed Yu. The course of chemotherapy killed off her cancer cells but weakened her. Her mother said Yu was once an active girl, who loved singing and dancing, but now she is quiet. ""She seems upset, but doesn't want to tell us,"" she said. Yu completed the paper cup telephone in 30 minutes. When she was asked to test it, she raised the cup and said, ""Mom, I love you."" Everybody cheered. Yu laughed and repeated the phrase, but louder. Her mother, on the verge of tears, said it was the happiest day she had known since Yu first went to the hospital. In the ward, happy times are brief, and pain can strike at any time.,Sun Peirui drew a picture of a golden lion which was pinned on the wall. However, he stopped coming to class when he became too weak as a result of undergoing a new course of chemotherapy. The 10-year-old's parents abandoned him after they divorced, so he was taken in by a welfare home. Last year, the home sent Peirui to Beijing from his hometown in Shandong province for treatment. He has frequent nosebleeds that can last as long as an hour and his mouth is covered in sores, which makes it difficult for him to eat. ""He misses the class very much and has asked me when he can return,"" said care worker Bu Xiurong, 62. Although many college students have offered their services as teachers, they have no concept of parenting skills. Lyu Wanxin, a volunteer sophomore student, tried to help a boy who cried at having to wear a face mask, but failed to pacify him. ""The job demands more than I ever imagined,"" Lyu said. The doctors and nurses are unable to ease the mental stress of their patients.,Liu Weixiong, who used to care for children with mental issues in Malaysia and Singapore, is keen for people of all ages and from all walks of life to join the program, because the classroom is about companionship as much as study. ""We welcome seniors, who can share their stories and experience. They are needed to help the children grow."" So far, the Beijing New Sunshine Charity Foundation has opened 26 ward classes in and around hospitals in 13 provinces. More than 5,000 children have attended them. However, the classes only have 17 full-time or part-time teachers, such as Liu Weixiong. The students aren't all leukemia patients, though, as some have other forms of cancer, and kidney diseases. All require long-term treatment. Liu Zhengchen plans to expand the faculty and provide more courses for children of different ages. ""I hope we can help more children with serious illnesses to maintain their studies and social adaptability so they can return to living normal lives as soon as possible,"" he said."

1,"China's economic development over the past 70 years has been a story of growth and prosperity, AXA Group CEO Thomas Buberl said at the China Development Forum in Beijing. ""I congratulate China on what they have achieved over the last few decades. They have been very successful,"" Buberl said during an exclusive interview at the forum on Saturday. The Chinese government has launched a series of measures for further reform and opening-up, such as the newly adopted Foreign Investment Law. Buberl considers the Foreign Investment Law of great significance, as it indicates China's commitment to open up its market wider — very important for AXA, the Paris-based insurance and investment group. ""We've just invested more in China. We are about to buy out one of our partners in non-life insurance. We are very willing to invest here and want to develop further here, because we believe it has a great potential. For us China is a very important market, and we would like to develop further,"" Buberl said. Buberl said motor insurance and life insurance remain very strong areas for AXA, and identified many exciting new opportunities in the Chinese market. ""One is certainly insuring infrastructure developments in the Belt and Road Initiative. We can contribute to that. And secondly, the development of the health system in China, in particular the private health system. We would really like to also contribute to that,"" Buberl said. Buberl also emphasized the importance of the company's presence locally in China, because as the AXA goes more into insuring infrastructure and helping with the health system, it will become more important to work with cities and municipalities. Buberl is very optimistic about the outlook of China's economy and believes with the government's continuous efforts to open up — especially in the financial sector — China will have a prosperous future. ""The trend will remain very positive because China has a strong internal demand and with the necessary reforms that have been passed on the opening of the markets, China will continue to prosper,"" Buberl said. ""My first China Development Forum proved to be an excellent experience. Not only were the panels and discussions thought-provoking, but the quality of the speakers and attendants was remarkable. This allowed for the sharing of insightful and innovative ideas, as well as open and engaging debate,"" Buberl said. ""As the CEO of a company which has been present in China for the past 20 years and is eager to invest and grow in the country, this platform putting together a diverse crowd of Chinese officials, international and local business executives and scholars is extremely valuable,"" he added. Taking new steps to further open up China's financial sectors, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission approved the establishment of the first foreign-funded pension insurance company in the country on Wednesday. To encourage a larger number of foreign banks and insurers that meet regulatory requirements to participate in the Chinese financial market, the commission said it will continuously push ahead with the opening-up of China's banking and insurance sectors and keep improving the business environment."

Watching sunset and full moon, tasting Chinese foods and mooncake, enjoying songs and dances, guessing riddles, drawing raffles, all these reminded them of the families far away on the other side of the globe. Falling on the 15th day of the 8th month according to the Chinese lunar calendar, the Mid-Autumn Festival is the second grandest festival in China after the Chinese New Year. It takes its name from the fact that it is always celebrated in the middle of the autumn. The day is also known as the Moon Festival, as at that time of the year the moon is at its roundest and brightest. Milla Li has been in Chicago for three weeks. She is a postgraduate majoring in financial risk management at the De Paul University in downtown Chicago. ""I am here to find some new Chinese friends, and have Chinese foods,"" she said smilingly. Being a Beijing native and taking her college education in Southwest China's Sichuan Province, Li has got accustomed to the life far from the family. Though admitting a little bit homesick, she told Xinhua joyfully: ""I love Chicago, the atmosphere and the environment here."" Zhou Taehoo is studying game design at the De Paul University.

0,"China aims to provide more efficient and convenient immigration services, especially after a record number of foreigners entered and exited the country in 2018, immigration authorities said. Foreigners entered and exited the country more than 95 million times in 2018, up 11.6 percent year-on-year, according to the National Immigration Administration. China has become a popular destination, particularly for visitors from South Korea, Japan, the United States and Russia, the administration said. Foreigners entered China more than 100,000 times via 72 hour and 144 hour visa-free stopovers in 2018, an increase of 23.9 percent year-on-year, it added. The visa-free policy has been introduced in many Chinese cities to attract more foreign visitors. The administration said the increasing number of people entering and exiting China has posed challenges for border control authorities, leading to simplified inspection procedures. People entering and exiting the country－both Chinese citizens and foreigners－were inspected by immigration administration authorities more than 651 million times in 2018 with the average inspection time less than 45 seconds. To provide more convenient immigration services for foreigners, Beijing opened two new centers on Wednesday, offering visa, residence permit and permanent residency services. The center in Shijingshan district will better accommodate the needs of foreign talent recruited for the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing as its organizing committee is based in the district, while the center in Tongzhou district will aid with the development of the area where much of the municipal government has been relocated, according to the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau's Exit-Entry Administration Department. The capital has already set up four such centers since March 2016. Unlike previous facilities that received walk-in applicants, the new centers require foreigners to fill in online applications before making appointments to save time verifying documents. ""The new centers aim to further optimize the city's business environment and better serve foreign talent,"" said Che Yan, head of the department. ""Currently, there are about 3,000 foreign permanent residents and a larger floating foreign population in Tongzhou. Many of them said procedures for immigration services have been simplified in recent years,"" an officer at the Tongzhou center said on condition of anonymity. A kindergarten teacher from the United Kingdom who wished to be referred as Jema was at the Tongzhou center on Wednesday to renew her work visa. ""In the past, I had to go to the department's headquarters in downtown Beijing for visa services. Now ... by submitting applications online in advance I can receive my visa within just seven working days,"" she said. China also stipulates harsher punishments for foreigners who illegally enter, live or work in China after the new Exit and Entry Administration Law took effect in July 2013. In 2018, China deported 69,000 foreigners, the administration said."

The move is part of the nation's long-term commitment to modernize and upgrade its service industry. Cheng Hong, a vice-mayor of Beijing, said the policy will extend the visa-free time for travelers from some countries who want to visit the three areas. Currently, the maximum stay in Beijing and Tianjin is 72 hours. The policy adjustment will facilitate ""the free circulation of resources"" in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, Cheng said. In 2016, Shanghai, joined by Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, took the lead in permitting 144-hour visa-free entry, which gave foreign visitors from 51 countries and regions more than enough time to travel or attend conferences in the region. Cheng made the remarks at a news conference on a comprehensive pilot plan, which the State Council promulgated in late July, to further open up the capital's service industry. Under the plan, the local authorities will reduce investment restrictions in major service sectors, including aviation, culture and arts, publication, banks, legal services, tourism and medical research and development. By streamlining regulations, Beijing expects to offer one-stop service to foreign investors considering the capital by the end of this year. Foreign investors who intend to set up a business in the city are now required to obtain about 15 licenses and certificates issued by 11 departments. The materials include an administrative license, information collection and management filings. ""Within this year, they will just need one single license,"" Chen said. ""By sharing repeated basic information among different departments and making the registration procedures available online, the whole process will only take five working days."" For years, China has been working to shift its economy toward a growth model based on consumption, services and innovation. Describing Beijing as a testing ground for the nationwide opening-up of the service sector, Wang Shouwen, vice-minister of commerce, said: ""We can expect new progress and breakthroughs in easing market access, speeding up institutional reform and establishing supportive systems for the sector."" In 2016, China's service sector accounted for 51.6 percent of the country's gross domestic product, up 1.4 percentage points from a year earlier, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. For Beijing alone, the added value of its service sector was around $292 billion in the same period. Contact the writers at jingshuiyu@chinadaily.com.cn"
0,"BEIJING — China will build a cluster of world-class airports in the northern Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region to improve connectivity and push forward coordinated regional development. By 2030, major airports in the region will be effectively connected with railways to establish a strong and coordinated air transport system, according to a guideline released by the National Development and Reform Commission and the Civil Aviation Administration of China. The region will offer 144-hour visa-free entry for international passengers, while air cargo will enjoy efficient one-stop customs clearance as authorities promise to improve both airport service and management, the guideline said. For Beijing, with the existing Beijing Capital International Airport and a new airport expected in service in 2019, the national capital is counting on the ""twin hubs"" to strengthen aviation capabilities with a focus on international flights. The government also plans to build Tianjin airport into an international air freight hub, while the one in Shijiazhuang, capital of Hebei province, will handle regional flights, it said. Other regional airports in cities including Tangshan, Zhangjiakou and Handan will be reconstructed or expanded, while new airports will be built in cities like Xingtai, Cangzhou, Kangbao and Fengning. To ensure regional connectivity, these airports will be linked with inter-city transport networks, including a railway service between Beijing's two airports, and railways and highways connecting the Xiongan New Area, a landmark new economic zone, with other key parts of the region. The regional transport network will be equipped with smart technology such as big data and ticket information sharing to let passengers take air-rail connecting trips with easy transfer between airports and railway stations, the document said. China rolled out a plan in 2015 for the coordinated development of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei. Progress has been made in many fields including environmental protection, public services and transport."
0,"All tourist beaches in Qinhuangdao, Hebei province, will become smoke-free if a new draft regulation on smoking is approved by the local government. If approved, the rule would make Qinhuangdao the first city to ban smoking on beaches. Drafted by the city's health commission, the regulation would also ban smoking in all indoor public spaces, workplaces and public transportation vehicles, as well as in some outdoor public areas, including scenic areas and near children's hospitals, schools and libraries. E-cigarettes would also be prohibited. The draft has been released on the city's website to solicit public opinion. ""By including beaches in the spaces where smoking is banned, we can set a standard for other coastal cities to follow,"" Liao Wenke, deputy director of the Chinese Association on Tobacco Control, was quoted as saying by china.caixin.com. Banning smoking on beaches is an international trend, according to an article on the association's website. It said Thailand, a popular destination for coastal tourism, initiated smoking bans on its 24 beaches in February last year. Wang Na, a 31-year-old from Qinhuangdao who has a 3-year-old daughter, said the smoke-free environment will encourage her to spend weekends with her family on the beaches more often. ""I don't like the smell of cigarettes and hate to let my daughter be exposed to it,"" Wang said, adding that she often sees discarded cigarette butts on the sand. Located about 250 kilometers east of Beijing, Qinhuangdao, on the shore of the Bohai Sea, is one of the most popular coastal cities in northern China. According to the Qinhuangdao Bureau of Statistics, the city received more than 60 million tourists from home and abroad last year, an increase of 19 percent year-on-year. ""The challenge is to enhance the public's awareness of smoking and to make smokers abide by the regulation,"" Liao said. He added that the authorities should strengthen publicity about the harm done by cigarettes and tobacco. To create a smoke-free environment, 18 Chinese cities had carried out anti-smoking regulations by the end of 2017, covering one-10th of the population, according to the National Health Commission. The regulation in Beijing, one of the toughest, has had an effect. From 2015 to 2018, the rate of discovering smoking or cigarette butts in public spaces in Beijing was cut from 28.7 percent to 4.9 percent of spaces inspected, according to an article on the tobacco control association's website."
