1,"Six Chinese cities made it into the list of the top 30 tech cities worldwide compiled by international real estate adviser Savills, and they account for a higher share of venture capital investment than their US counterparts. Beijing recorded an average $34 billion of venture capital investment per year in the last three years, which was higher than that of New York and San Francisco. The list - led by New York, San Francisco and London - ranked the Chinese cities of Shanghai in 15th place, Beijing in 17th, Hong Kong in 20th, Shenzhen in 24th, Hangzhou in 25th, and Chengdu in 26th. As important centers of technology within their regions, the cities on the list are assessed by 100 metrics, ranging from the number of days needed to start a business to the cost of a flat white coffee. The metrics are grouped into six categories, namely business environment, technology environment, city buzz and wellness, talent pool, real estate costs and mobility. Chinese cities have emerged as leaders in shared mobility services, although the overall mobility ranking puts London first on the list. On individual Chinese cities, the Savills report says some of China’s largest technology firms are headquartered in Beijing, close to regulators.  Shanghai leads Chinese cities as a more global technology city, thanks to an international business environment and better of quality of life for residents. Shenzhen is seen as an exceptionally youthful tech city, which benefits from strengthening links with Hong Kong and the technology-stock exchange, ChiNext. Hangzhou, which is home to internet giant Alibaba, stands out as a lower-cost smaller city, famed for its West Lake, which is a UNESCO World Heritage site. Chengdu’s technology economy has soared on outsourcing, with its government being pro-business and technology investments rising. Tapping into a vast, internet-enabled domestic market, Chinese technology giants have moved up fast and, thanks to integrated payment systems, revolutionized the way business is conducted in the country, says the report, which notes that China is also a global leader in artificial intelligence technology. Already established as a center of technology manufacturing, China sees its homegrown hardware firms making global moves."

""The China Railways Corp (CRC) will continue to innovate both in technologies and management,"" said Lu Chunfang, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and the general director of the Beijing to Shanghai High-Speed Railway. Lu, a member of the 13th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), was speaking before the closing ceremony of the first session of the 13th CPPCC National Committee in Beijing on Thursday. China will improve security for its future high-speed trains on three fronts—operations, design and material, as well as its internal software and mechanism, Lu said. Engineers are also working on environmental sensing, self-driving, magnetic rails, vacuum tunnels and other technologies to make future trains smarter and faster. Trains that are quieter, use less energy and more environmentally friendly materials are also in the works. ""Future Chinese high-speed trains will be safer, faster, and more comfortable than ever,"" he said. In 2017, China had 26,000 kilometers of high-speed rail, accounting for more than 60 percent of the world's high-speed rail, according to CRC, the nation's railway operator. China's high-speed railway coverage will reach 38,000 kilometers by 2025, as Lu said. In terms of technological innovations for the trains, ""we have to fix our shortcomings by replacing foreign parts with domestically designed equipment,"" he said. ""At the same time, we have to build on top of technologies that we are currently leading."""

0,"The title of an ongoing exhibition in Beijing has four Chinese characters－  (a key junction on the outskirts of the capital city)－which are an apt description of Tongzhou, a district in the eastern part of the capital. Visiting the exhibition－comprising 169 displays－at the Capital Museum in Beijing is like opening a book about Tongzhou. It tells of its early glory and how it was rejuvenated thanks to a canal. The district has been in the news in recent years after it was designated as Beijing's ""sub-center"". And this has led to the large-scale construction of infrastructure there. But as construction began, a well-preserved ancient city dating to the Western Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 24) was unearthed. The site has been identified as the remains of Luxian county from 195 BC. The find was among China's top 10 archaeological discoveries of 2016.,Yu Ping, deputy director of the Beijing municipal administration of cultural heritage, says the find was never properly showcased to the public. At the exhibition, daily items, pottery, construction materials and other cultural relics from the site are on display. ""The (Luxian) site is unique because it is the only discovered county-level city ruins from the Western Han Dynasty,"" says Gao Hongqing, curator of the exhibition. ""It fills a void in our studies of urban construction and local government structure from that dynasty."" Gao says Luxian was closely connected with Beijing over the centuries. In 938, the Liao Dynasty (916-1125) made Beijing one of its ""five metropolises"", and in 1153, the Jurchen ruler of the Jin Dynasty (1115-1234) moved its capital city to Beijing, making it the political center of northern China. ""Due to its pivotal position, the status of Tongzhou kept growing,"" says Gao.,Many artifacts from the Capital Museum's own collection, which were also unearthed in Tongzhou, are displayed. One of the items is a Liao Dynasty ceramic jar (pictured top) designed like leather bags used by nomadic people. Kublai Khan's move to make Beijing the capital of the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368) also gave a boost to Tongzhou's fortunes, especially after the construction of the Grand Canal, which links Beijing and Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang province. ""The city expanded and the population also grew rapidly,"" says Gao. ""And that created a greater need for food. Tongzhou then became a hub for food supply, which was transported via the canal from southern China."" According to historical records, there were as many as 13 state-owned silos in Tongzhou during the Yuan Dynasty.,In 1329, as much as 3.5 million dan (a container that could hold about 75 kilograms) of rice was transported via the canal from southern China to Beijing. In 2014, a section of canal in Tongzhou was put on the UNESCO World Heritage List. Gao says that Tongzhou was a crucial link both during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties. And this is highlighted by some of the items on display like a plate used to weigh rice at Tongzhou's port. There is a list of codes on display that shows there was a complicated system to check food quality and prevent fraud. The Tongzhou District Museum also contributed some exhibits. Zheng Xusheng, head of the museum, talks about a Qing map of the Grand Canal, from Beijing to Shandong province, from the reign of Yongzheng (1722-35). According to Zheng, the map was taken to Japan during the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression (1931-45) but was brought back to China around 2000. ""You can still find many facilities that exist today on the map,"" he says. The exhibition runs until July 23."
1,"BEIJING - China on Saturday published the master plan document for Xiongan New Area, creation of which is ""a strategic decision with profound historic significance made by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core."" ""General Secretary Xi Jinping has planned for, made decisions on and promoted [the Xiongan New Area] in person, devoting painstaking efforts,"" reads the preface of the document released by the Hebei provincial authorities. ""The establishment of Xiongan New Area in Hebei province is a significant decision and arrangement by the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core to push forward the coordinated development of Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei,"" the plan reads. Xiongan is another new area of ""national significance"" following the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone and Shanghai Pudong New Area, according to the document, which has been approved by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council. It is ""a strategy that will have lasting importance for the millennium to come, and a significant national event,"" the plan says. The plan is the fundamental guideline on the planning and development of Xiongan New Area, mapping out the area's future by 2035 and looking ahead into the mid-21st century, it reads. It has 10 chapters, namely the general requirements, developing scientific and reasonable layout, shaping the city landscape for a new era, building a beautiful natural ecology and environment, developing high-end and hi-tech industries, provision of quality shared public services, construction of fast and highly-efficient transportation network, building a green and smart new city, fostering modernized city security system, ensuring orderly and effective implementation of the plan. In April 2017, China announced the establishment of Xiongan New Area, spanning three counties in Hebei province about 100 km southwest of Beijing. Xiongan will be the location for Beijing's non-capital functions. The area will become a new home for Beijing's colleges, hospitals, business headquarters, and financial and public institutions that meet the requirement of Xiongan's status and development. The document listed overall development goals for the new area. By 2035, Xiongan will basically develop into a modern city that is green, intelligent, and livable, with relatively strong competitiveness and harmonious human-environment interaction. By the middle of the century, it will become a significant part of the world-class Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei city cluster, effectively performing Beijing's non-capital functions and providing the Chinese solution to ""big city malaise."" It will serve as an example of the country's high-quality development with world-leading economic and social indicators and a modernized governance system, which will manifest advantages of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics. Xiongan is expected to become ""a model city in the history of human development,"" the document says. The document also requires that resources and environment carrying capacity must be taken as an inflexible constraint of space layout so that the population size, land use scale as well as the development intensity of the new area can be reasonably decided. The document says that priority shall go to ecological protection while the new area is pursuing green development. With the total area of construction land set at approximately 530 square kilometers, Xiongan will strictly control land use and cap its land development intensity at 30 percent. About 10 percent of the new area's land will be put under permanent protection as basic farmland, while the population density will be no more than 10,000 people per square kilometer. The document says that Xiongan New Area aims to explore a new pattern for urban-rural development. Within a land area of 50 square kilometers, new types of villages will be developed which will feature thriving businesses, a pleasant living environment, sound infrastructure facilities and public services, and efficient grassroots governance. The document says that ecological restoration work will be started in Baiyangdian Lake, including restoring the lake's area to 360 square kilometers. Meanwhile, water pollution will be treated while the forest coverage rate will rise from 11 percent to 40 percent. Moreover, a negative list will be implemented to close down and ward off high-pollution and energy-intensive production. In the long term, Baiyandian National Park will be established."
1,"Leaders in business, media, finance and education shared their views on China-US trade tensions at the China Development Forum in Beijing. Tariffs need to come down, and every effort of protectionism will ultimately be damaging to the world economy but also to the local economy. That's why I think it's a big challenge and I very much hope that over the coming weeks and months China and the US will find a solution to the dispute and ultimately we will see all tariffs coming down and the further opening up of the market in China, US, Europe and the rest of the world.,I hope China-US tariff tensions will not last longer, and maybe we can get an agreement to avoid an escalation as it is not good for the world economy. My wish is for people to sit at the table to discuss more, because nobody will gain from trade disputes.,It was unwise for President Trump to start trade tensions, because China-US trade is particularly in favor of US consumers. The bilateral trade for the two countries has helped US reduce prices for goods and increase disposable income substantially. Trump did this partly for show, to win more support for the midterm elections. This won't have major impact on the real economy, though it has impacted the financial market at the moment. Trump may make a fuss to impress his voters in particular areas and regions in the United States in the run-up for the midterm election. My suggestion to Trump is to sit down and start negotiation early, as this is much better for the United States.,China-US trade tension is a zero-sum game and no country has ever succeeded in this environment if there is a trade war.,I don't think the tensions will go away. I think they are going to persist. I expect them to go up and down. I think they will probably be managed, contained and not lead to an explosive outcome."

The students are from the Linfen Red Ribbon School, in Linfen, Shanxi province, which is the only school in China to specifically recruit students with HIV. A total of 16 senior middle school students at the educational facility undertook the college entrance exam this year, according to Guo Xiaoping, principal of the school.  ""Of the 15, two students have entered a four-year study program at colleges which award bachelor's degrees, and the remainder of the studentshave gone to three-year junior colleges at the beginning of the month, in cities including Beijing and Taiyuan,"" said Yuan Jizheng, deputy director of the foundation's general office.  The foundation will provide more than 1.5 million yuan ($231,000) to the students, in order to cover their tuition fees and living expenses during their entire college study, according to Yuan Jizheng, deputy director of the foundation's general office.  ""Most of the students are infected through mother-baby transmission and had lost one or both of their parents, making them difficult to afford the college on their own,"" she said.  ""Most of the money comes from donations from entrepreneurs,"" she said. ""Beijing Leadingpharm Medicine Technology Co, a pharmaceutical research and development company in Beijing, pledged to donate 1million yuan for the fund on Thursday."" Inthe past 10 years, the Chinese Foundation for Prevention of STDs and AIDS has delivered more than 1,000 assistances to women living in poverty affected by HIV, and more than 23,000 assistances to children living with HIV, Wang Yumin, president of the foundation, said."

""Poverty alleviation and social development are important issues in my country,"" said Fernando Lugris, Uruguay's ambassador to China. ""China is helping us to solve them, and we would love to work with the Chinese government on further developments in sustainable use."" Mashudu Silimela, the agriculture, forestry and fisheries counselor at the South African embassy in Beijing, said his country faces a serious water shortage, and soil erosion is also a major issue. ""Planting apple and walnut trees has provided an effective way for my country to solve environmental issues and preserve our water and soil,"" he said. Rainer Klepper, counselor for food and agriculture at the German embassy in Beijing, has been impressed by the developments he has witnessed in China. He added that Germany needs to consider implementing afforestation programs, but said the government has not explained the relationship between the programs and people's living standards clearly enough. He said he believes that China also needs to raise awareness of the issues, because many people regard forests and woodlands as sources of materials, such as wood, and do not understand the important role they can play in maintaining living standards. Sustainable development is as important in Germany as it is in China, and it is important to protect limited resources across the world, he said."

1,"As the World Economic Forum's Annual Meeting of the New Champions 2018, or Summer Davos Forum, kicked off on Tuesday, more than 2,500 participants from over 100 countries have gathered in North China's Tianjin, making it the forum's largest meeting after the annual meeting in Switzerland's Davos-Klosters. Among the forum's varied sessions, the session ""China's Opening-Up: 40 Years On"" held on Tuesday received great attention. Five foreign participants shared their views with China Daily Website on the forum and the achievements in China since the introduction of the reform and opening-up policy 40 years ago. Fabian von Heimburg, co-founder and managing director of Hotnest Technology Ltd, a German-Chinese joint venture that provides artificial intelligence data service for China's media and advertising industry, said it is amazing to meet people from all different countries in China and the meetings are also a big sign of China's opening-up. ""More and more people are trying to cooperate with China. China is also trying to cooperate with a lot of other countries,"" he said. Heimburg, who came to China for the first time in 2004, said the development of the country is so fast that China is already leading the world in e-commerce, fintech and artificial intelligence and it is fascinating to see and be part of it. ""Basically 40 years ago there were very few cars, very few machines in China, but now China is competing with US and Europe in a lot of the most advanced areas in the world. So from having almost nothing to being one of the most developed countries on earth, I think that is a tremendous achievement,"" Heimburg said. He thinks Germany can benefit in many ways from China's massive and developed market. In his article published recently called "" "", he wrote that the impact of China's opening and development can be felt in every industry, especially the start-up and venture capital sectors. He said Europe should learn from the fast growth of China's start-up ecosystem by properly financing its start-up ecosystem, creating dominant players that support the local ecosystem and developing a clear industrial policy for the digital sector.,Laxmi Narasimna Vinyl Reddy Pothala, founder and CEO of Fresh Minds Service Private Limited, said attending the event in Tianjin is an amazing experience as he has been able to connect with a lot of companies and understand innovations and developments that are happening across the world. He said China's reform and opening-up policy can benefit Indian companies and Indian companies are working closely with China. ""There are a lot of things, especially technologies and new innovations, that we also want to learn from here and take them back,"" he said.,Justin Newton, founder and CEO of US company Netki Inc, said he finds the forum a great event to collaborate with innovators, business leaders, and government officials that are outside of the direct field that he works in everyday. Living in the US, Newton said in the past 40 years China has made a great contribution to the world, not only in terms of knowledge, expertise and skills but also the large market that it represents for companies like his and others to be able to actually work inside of China. Newton said the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative can build tighter integration between countries in the region in terms of trade and exchange of ideas. And having a strong belief that open borders with respect to the ideas of both trade and the exchange of ideas is to the benefit of all the participants that are involved in trade, he said he tends to look for opportunities of greater engagement and greater partnership rather than trying to build walls and break down those kinds of cooperation and communication. ""I think one of the things the World Economic Forum stands for is finding ways for countries and for individuals in those countries to work together in common cause to make things better for all of us"", he said.,Ken Miller, co-founder and product director of UK company PanIntelligence, said for British companies it has become easier to do business and trade with China and a great example is that it only took him nine hours to fly directly from UK's Manchester to Beijing this time. Miller said the China-proposed Belt and Initiative is very exciting that it will open up trade routes and benefit all the countries involved in the initiative. ""I think the more open and the more we can work with each other, the greater the opportunities are for everybody. That goes for people, goes for countries and goes for everything,"" he said. ""Free trade is something that we should really try and treasure and hold on to. You should be looking at countries like America to lead with a very poor example and started to close trade down,"" he added.,John Plummer, senior portfolio editor at Springer Nature, said the pace of technological development in China is great and he thinks the Chinese government has done very well in tackling the challenge of balancing technological development with raising the living standard for the average person in the past forty years. He said Springer Nature, as a science publishing company having a presence in China, has been benefited a lot from China's opening-up. ""The opening up of China has allowed us to really report to the world the great research that has been done in China. The pace of developments of scientific output from China is really phenomenal in terms of both the amounts of research, but more importantly, especially for a company like us, the quality of research,"" Plummer said."
1,"China announced Saturday it will establish the Xiongan New Area in Hebei province, as part of advancing the coordinated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. This is a new area of national significance furthering similar efforts beyond the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone and the Shanghai Pudong New Area, according to a circular issued by the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and the State Council.  Let's take a look at some things you should know about the Xiongan New Area. Located some 100 kilometers southwest of downtown Beijing, the Xiongan New Area covers the counties of Xiongxian, Rongcheng and Anxin, and is home to Baiyangdian, one of the largest freshwater wetlands in North China. The new area will cover around 100 square km initially and will be expanded to 200 square km in the mid-term and about 2,000 square km in the long term, according to the official circular. The new area will operate as a new growth pole for the country's economy, and also aim to curb urban sprawl, bridge growth disparities and protect ecology. The area will be of the same national significance as the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, established in the 1980s, and the Shanghai Pudong New Area, created in the 1990s, Xinhua said in a commentary. The move will help phase out some non-capital functions from Beijing, explore a new model of optimized development in densely-populated areas, restructure the urban layout in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and cultivate new innovation-driven engines, according to the circular. 1. Building a world-class, green, modern and smart city 2. Becoming a city with scenic ecological environment, blue skies, fresh air and clean water 3. Developing high-end innovative industries as new growth engines 4. Having quality public services and infrastructure, as well as a new urban management model 5.

The school was destroyed at 2:28:01 pm Beijing Standard Time on May 12, 2008 by a magnitude-8 earthquake. The earthquake is known as the Wenchuan earthquake, which led to around 87,000 deaths and missing cases and traumatized hundreds of thousands of survivors. Compared to the relic of Xuankou Middle School, which is kept by the local government to commemorate the victims, the other parts of Yingxiu town have a completely different aspect. New houses and facilities, white and pale brown, sit neatly and vividly along the Min River. Over the past 10 years, people in Sichuan province have never stopped reconstructing their hometowns destroyed in the earthquake. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has supported the province in many areas, including education, healthcare, infrastructure and conservation. Wolong National Nature Reserve was devastated in the earthquake, with 14 of 32 giant panda houses totally destroyed. After receiving a donation of 1.4 billion yuan (HK$1.73 billion) from the HKSAR, the newly built Shenshuping protection base has 30 giant panda houses, which are now home to 55 giant pandas. Nineteen of them are baby pandas, born at the base last year. Sichuan University-Hong Kong Polytechnic University Institute for Disaster Management and Reconstruction was established to better study and manage the disaster. Officially opened in 2013, the institute has set up labs and facilities for disaster management, including a physical therapy lab, a disaster and trauma experience training area and a post-disaster health management lab. Teaching staff from PolyU come to the institute twice a week for exchanges. Over the past 10 years, the people of Sichuan have dedicated themselves not only to disaster recovery — Chengdu Tianfu International Airport, which began construction in 2016, will be ready in 2020, making Chengdu the third city in China after Beijing and Shanghai to have two airports. Chengdu’s Tianfu New District, officially launched in December 2011, is expected to push the development of the city’s modern industries and fuel the economic development of the entire west. The new district has become an important hub for developing both a regional center and a greater metropolis."

The Beijing Food and Drug Administration announced the inspection over the weekend, saying its main targets will be restaurant chains, canteen suppliers and establishments with previous food safety problems.  ""Business licenses, dishwashers, sanitation equipment and pest and disease control are the focus of the inspection,"" said Duan Zhiyong, director of the administration's supervision department.  Legal Evening News, a Beijing newspaper, reported on Friday that the operations of two Beijing branches of Haidilao, a popular hotpot chain with restaurants in about 60 Chinese cities, were unsanitary.  Videos taken by hidden cameras showed rat-infested kitchens, a dishwasher caked with oily food residue and a worker trying to fix a sewage blockage with a soup ladle.  The hotpot chain, which originated in Jianyang, Sichuan province, admitted its management faults and apologized in a public statement issued on Friday afternoon.  The administration has launched a safety check on all branches of the hotpot chain in the city and talked to representatives of the company on Saturday.  ""We've also ordered Haidilao to open its kitchens to the public in a month and report its overhaul measures,"" the statement said, adding that the chain's sanitation rating will be downgraded.  Fan Jing, a Beijing native and a hotpot fan, applauded the inspection, ""because food safety must take priority in a restaurant's operation"". But she said the inspection should be extended to small canteens in the city.  ""Food safety checks in supermarkets or big restaurants are common, but grocery stores with some safety risks in communities are rarely inspected,"" she said.  Li Xiaoou, another Beijing native, said the administration should disclose the inspection results in a timely manner online, to help residents know about problems and which restaurants are unhygienic.  ""After all, we cannot check whether a restaurant's kitchen is clean or not when we eat there. What we rely on is the authorities' increasing supervision, and self-inspections by the restaurants,"" he said.  Xinhua contributed to this story."

Xian'er, which is based at the Longquan Monastery in northwest Beijing, received 42,000 questions in its newly ""learned"" language by 5:30 pm on Thursday. When asked what it liked most, the robot monk replied, ""I like ice cream, and wish I could have 100 ice cream cones at one time."" However, many questions were more likely to receive the response, ""I need to ask my master."" ""It is interesting to chat with Xian'er in English, although some replies make no sense,"" said Deng Lingyu, a university student. Han Yu, who heads the monastery's robot team, said, ""Actually, when the robot doesn't know how to reply, it will say so."" A physical version of Xian'er, which is dressed in a yellow robe like a Buddhist monk, was unveiled in October 2015 and can sense its surroundings, answer questions and interact in simple conversations. It still speaks only Mandarin. The account on WeChat has about 1.2 million followers, increasing daily by over 1,000. Since the account was established in 2015, many people have chatted with it online. With the development of artificial intelligence and the experience gained from chatting in Chinese, Han said her team came up with the idea of making it communicate in English in May. Xian Qing, a monk from Longquan Monastery, said, ""An English-speaking Xian'er can better spread Buddhist wisdom to people around the world."" He added that many overseas Chinese and foreigners like the cute monk. A team of monks and volunteers, led by Han, came together to create the robot. Han said most of the 90 people on the team were volunteers, adding 10 were from the monastery. ""We have several programmers from Tencent－the mother company of WeChat－providing technological support. Most translating volunteers are recruited temporarily, including people from different professions and even teenagers,"" Han said. The team has translated about 3,700 dialogues commonly used in daily life and about 2,000 general words like ""hello"". It also will continue to update the robot's database based on new problems occurring every day and questions that the robot couldn't answer properly, she said. Han said volunteers do not have to be Buddhists. The voluntary translators are required to have an excellent English ability and understand Western cultures. The most important thing is that they have to know and like Xian'er. When Xian'er is told its English is not very good, it replies that it is ""just a little monk"" and asks people to not ask difficult questions. Han said Xian'er is an English novice, and through more practice it can learn. The monk robot can only communicate with typed messages. The team is working to make it speak English. ""The team is looking for a boy who can speak English fluently to be the voice of Xian'er,"" Han said."
0,"With Beijing's new world-class airport, Beijing Daxing International Airport, set to open by the end of September, a vast array of infrastructure is being completed to serve and support the travel hub. The Daxing Airport Highway, Tuanhe Road and a complex web of underground pipes and tunnels used for broadband, electricity, information and more, have been connected and integrated with Daxing Airport Express Rail and Beijing-Xiongan High-speed Railway. The immense construction project, which got underway in 2016 and cost 17.1 billion yuan ($2.48 billion), represented engineering challenges on a scale unseen before. Apart from Tuanhe Road, the three other transport routes to the airport are elevated and needed to be constructed at the same time in order to minimize impact on existing infrastructure. At one point, three transport routes run as flyovers side by side reaching as high as 30 meters above ground, the first time such a feat has been achieved in China, according to Zhang Yanduo, assistant to the general manager of Beijing Infrastructure Investment Transportation Co, in charge of the project. ""With the roads and rail up in the air we have saved land usage by more than 40 hectares,"" he said. Another engineering feat required that the Daxing Airport Highway, an express rail line and Tuanhe Road be built above and over Beijing-Shanghai High-speed Railway while it was in operation, setting a new standard for precision construction, Zhang said.,Now complete, the transport links are being run via an intelligent management system which utilizes big data, cloud computing and the internet of things to ensure maximum safety and efficiency. For example, signage on the highway illuminates automatically in low light and on rainy or foggy days. A dynamic speed limit control system signals drivers to adjust their speed according to safety requirements. Materials with ice and snow melting properties used in the tarmac, and automatic salt sprinkling devices prevent road surfaces from becoming frozen and slippery. At tolls, drivers can pass without stopping with payment being facilitated by smart cameras, which scan license plates and deduct the toll from a linked account automatically. A central traffic management control room acts as the beating heart of the whole operation. There is real-time traffic monitoring, big data-based intelligent analysis to monitor road conditions and predict possible problems. This immense transport infrastructure has been put in place to serve another massive transport infrastructure project: Beijing Da xing International Airport. Earlier this week, four commercial passenger planes completed flight trials at what is to become a new transportation hub for China to connect with the rest of the world.,The complex project impressed some 20 journalists from eight countries, including Pakistan, Mongolia, Nepal and Cambodia, during a recent media tour organized by the media center for the Conference on Dialogue of Asian Civilizations and Beijing Information Office. During the tour they gained a better understanding of Beijing's development. ""My first impression is that this is a very big project,"" said Bilal Ahmed Sabri, a reporter from Pakistan Today. ""It uses the most advanced technologies, such as the freeze-proofing road and illuminated signs to help avoid accidents. And it takes a short time to reach the airport."" Mahendra Subedi from Nepalese national news agency Rastriya Samachar Samiti said, since Beijing Capital International Airport is quite crowded, another airport is very valuable for improving the environment and quality. ""This is going to promote connectivity for China and many other countries, and boost people-to-people relations in tourism and other sectors,"" he said. Fathimath Saara, a broadcaster from Public Service Media in the Maldives, said the highway will help enhance Beijing's position as an international hub. ""It's not only connected by flight and trade, but everything."""
0,"The country's top environmental watchdog will dispatch about 18,000 law enforcement officers to conduct air pollution control inspections in three key areas starting on Monday. Last year, the Ministry of Environmental Protection－which has since been incorporated into the Ministry of Ecology and Environment－sent 5,600 law enforcement officers to 28 major cities in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region to inspect air pollution control work. This year, the inspection, dubbed ""Blue Sky Protection Campaign"", will be extended to the Yangtze River Delta and the Fenhe and Weihe plains in Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces, respectively. The campaign is scheduled to last until the end of April 2019. It was launched based on the fact that some areas are still troubled by heavy pollution, despite continued improvement in air quality in key regions, according to the ministry's environmental supervision and inspection bureau. ""Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region is still the area with the worst air quality in the country,"" the bureau said in a statement. ""Hebei, Shanxi, Henan and Shandong provinces and Tianjin saw no more than 60 percent of days last year with fairly good air quality. And the situation in the Fenhe and Weihe river valleys is deteriorating, not improving."" The bureau said the campaign will have 12 areas of focus, including poorly managed－and polluting－small enterprises, industrial boilers, surface mines and transportation reform. While inspection teams will be dispatched to 28 designated cities in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and 11 cities in the Fenhe and Weihe river valleys regularly, inspections in the Yangtze River Delta area will be irregular, the bureau said. It said all the inspectors in the campaign are from local environmental departments or ones affiliated with the ministry. The large-scale inspection by a body of the central government will help train law enforcement officers and offer them opportunities to communicate with each other to improve their capabilities. ""The Blue Sky Protection Campaign is the most important priority in pollution control work,"" said Li Ganjie, minister of ecology and environment, in a video conference held on Friday to launch the inspection. He also vowed to make four ""obvious"" achievements: to further decrease the concentration of PM2.5 (tiny particles measuring 2.5 microns in diameter or less), to decrease the number of days with heavy air pollution, to improve the air environment and to make the public happier with more blue skies. In addition to the air pollution control campaign, the ministry will launch at least six more central environmental inspections that will cover black, foul-smelling bodies of water in urban areas; the protection of water sources; and Yangtze River protection and restoration. ""The central inspections, which target key regions, fields and problems, represent a new long-term mechanism rather than a short-term action,"" said Li, adding that the purpose of the inspections is to help local governments identify environmental problems and solve them. He also asked inspectors to strictly observe the law. The ministry has publicized email and mailing addresses to accept reports from the general public about violations of law and discipline."
0,"Beijing will enhance the protection of its historical and cultural heritage as well as old town and try to restore the ""one axis, one line"" landscape, according to the cultural relics work conference of the city held recently. Beijing will restore the ""one axis, one line"" landscape, strengthen the integrated conservation of its old town, speed up the conservation of traditional looks in areas where Palace Museum, Temple of Heaven and Bell and Drum Towers are located, protect and make use of the historical scenery of ""Three Hills and Five Gardens,"" and work out plans on the protection and utilization of Great Wall culture belt, Western Hills culture belt and Grand Canal culture belt. Mayor of Beijing Cai Qi said that the rich historical and cultural heritage in Beijing should be well protected to improve its construction of Beijing as a national cultural center during an inspection and study on the protection and application for world heritage of the Central Axis of Beijing. As an important component of the old town of Beijing, Dongcheng will build six main traditional culture areas including Nanluoguxiang and the area between Dongsisantiao and Dongsibatiao and try to renovate 80 percent of its historical and cultural blocks. Xicheng will strive to vacate and renovate a batch of key historical buildings especially guild halls and former residences of celebrities registered as cultural relics. Liu Yuzhu, director of State Administration of Cultural Heritage, expressed that the State Administration of Cultural Heritage would provide more supports for cultural heritage protection within the construction regions of Beijing's sub-center and 2022 Winter Olympics as well as the establishment of cultural heritage protection projects in Beijing."
1,"BEIJING - Senior leaders of the Communist Party of China (CPC) on Thursday stressed efforts to build Xiongan New Area into a ""high-quality modern socialist city."" Xi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, presided over the meeting attended by members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee. The area, established in April 2017, is a new economic zone about 100 kilometers southwest of Beijing in Hebei province. It is the third new area of national significance after the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone and the Shanghai Pudong New Area. CPC leaders agreed that building the new area is a ""historic project"" after hearing a report about the progress on a development plan for Xiongan. The new area is significant for helping phase out some non-capital functions from Beijing, exploring a new model of development in densely populated areas, restructuring the layout of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, promoting high-quality development, and creating a new engine for the modernized economy, according to a statement released after the meeting. Designing of the new area plan has made important progress on the basis of thorough investigation, feedback from different parties, and revisions and improvements, said the statement. The planning and building of Xiongan New Area should feature a global perspective and an international standard with Chinese characteristics, making it a national model in promoting high-quality development, it said. The meeting also stressed a reasonable layout for the city, with innovation in accordance with the regional culture and landscape. Efforts should be made to build a digital and intelligent city, with an emphasis on green development, according to the statement. A string of national innovative platforms and efficient transportation networks should be created in the area, it said. Measures should be taken to support Xiongan in accelerating reform and opening up, while a number of major projects should be launched at an appropriate time, it said."

0,"Online discussions about sexual misconduct have increased in China, with allegations surfacing against some prominent men from media, academic, charity, religious and corporate circles during the past few weeks. At least one case is now part of a broader Chinese police investigation. The government has included a provision on sexual harassment in the workplace in a civil code draft that was presented to the National People's Congress Standing Committee last week, according to Xinhua News Agency. The draft guideline asks employers to take steps to prevent harassment and heed complaints. China Daily's recent interviews with 12 people－university students, a teacher, a social worker and a lawyer, who live in Beijing, elsewhere on the Chinese mainland, and the United States－indicate a rising awareness in China of sexual harassment, abuse and assault, aided by an engaged social media. All six female students interviewed said they had faced some form of sexual harassment. One alleged she had been assaulted by an older male relative. The social worker and lawyer called for stronger legal measures to combat sexual harassment. While rape cases are prosecuted under the Criminal Law, harassment is often viewed through the prism of administrative regulations, mainly related to labor disputes. The three male students interviewed said young men in China seem to have a better grasp of gender equality than men from earlier generations. All interviewees were unanimous that sexual misconduct is ultimately about power structures－whether on university campuses or in the workplace. In July, the Beijing Qianqian Law Firm witnessed a rise in the number of women seeking advice on sexual harassment. Set up in 1995, it has handled an average of 10 sexual assault and harassment cases a year, with most related to rape. Lyu Xiaoquan, its executive director, said female university students and women from research institutions have visited the firm recently, saying they have faced harassment. He said the firm, which also provides a pro bono service, counsels victims on how to proceed with harassment cases step-by-step. But the task has not been easy, because unlike rape, which falls under the Criminal Law, and has prison sentences ranging from three to 10 years and sometimes beyond, depending on the severity of the crime, sexual harassment is not governed by a stand-alone law. Lyu pointed to the special administrative regulations for the protection of female workers and the Women's Rights Protection Act as two documents that refer to harassment. The special regulations, which took effect in 2012 and were formulated by the State Council, China's Cabinet, stipulate that organizations ""shall prevent sexual harassment of female workers"", and the women's act of 2005 states that women can report harassment to ""relevant institutions"". ""Apart from labor arbitration, 'loss of dignity' is the other ground for filing cases related to sexual harassment,"" Lyu said. ""We want a separate law for sexual harassment, but before that, we need to settle questions such as 'What is the definition of sexual harassment?' and 'What purpose would such a law serve?'"" he added. Li Dan, a women's rights campaigner and director of a nongovernmental organization in Beijing, favors more legal clarity on the subject of sexual harassment and publicity surrounding it. Citing the example of the Anti-Domestic Violence Law, which took effect in 2015, he said many survivors and some police stations still do not know about it. ""Even if the victims want help, few know what to do,"" Li said. Apart from students, female factory workers are very vulnerable to sexual harassment, according to earlier surveys by labor organizations in Guangdong province. After allegations of sexual misconduct were made in the past three months or so against relatively high-profile individuals－who have denied any wrongdoing－online discussions on the topic have escalated. Even so, such discussions are largely confined to the media, students and activists, Li said. According to Sina Weibo user ""Bu Lang Fen Zi"", sexual harassment ought to be included in a legal framework, and the opportunity provided by the discussions should be used to promote legislative enforcement, otherwise, the bravery of those who experience it will not bear fruit. Chang Jiang, an associate professor at Tsinghua University, created the #I'llBeYourVoice hashtag on Sina Weibo in late July, and was soon flooded by responses. Chang said more than 600 people, the vast majority of them women, had shared stories of sexual misconduct through private messages to him that week. He redacted the Sina Weibo ""handles"" of those whose messages he reposted on his public page. All such posts were either from victims or those who knew victims. His page was viewed some 1 million times alone on Aug 1. Sexual misconduct is a universal problem and no country can claim to be free of it, with variations only in degree. In the Chinese context, social media have been at the forefront of the battle. Chang said that among the messages he received on Sina Weibo in late July, the main groups were female college students or young graduates who had experienced sexual harassment, women who were born or grew up in rural areas and alleged that they had suffered sexual abuse or assault, and ""real-name whistleblowers"" who accused specific people of misconduct. ""It was heartbreaking, especially when I read the stories from the girls in the countryside,"" said Chang, 36, who teaches journalism and communication at the university in Beijing. ""This is something so dark that I never imagined (existed) before."" In a culturally conservative society such as China's, such campaigns can help eliminate ""a sense of shame"" that victims of assault, abuse and harassment might feel, he added. The six female university students interviewed said the online discussions empower women as well as men to break the invisible code of silence. The majority wanted to remain anonymous when talking to China Daily about their ordeals, but most described the women who identified themselves on social media while sharing similar stories as ""brave"". One interviewee said it is easier for influential women to come forward than for other women. It took years for some Hollywood actresses to go public with accusations against film producer Harvey Weinstein. ""It is a kind of reform to promote gender equality and awareness,"" said a 22-year-old female student from Beijing Foreign Studies University, of the wider online engagement over the subject in China. ""My friends and I have experienced different kinds of sexual harassment in public. And, such things have cast a shadow in our hearts,"" said the student of Chinese, adding that gender discrimination is a root cause. Shi Hanjin, a Chinese student who attends college in Los Angeles, said she had yet to encounter any woman who had not felt sexually harassed, but that through sharing stories women find out that they are not alone. ""I have met male strangers who have stared at me or tried to grope me in public both in Guangzhou (the capital of Guangdong province) and here in LA,"" Shi said. Three other female students in China emphasized the need to enhance gender education from childhood. ""The government should help higher education institutions establish related organizations to receive and deal with reports of sexual harassment,"" said a 23-year-old female student of public finance at Zhongnan University of Economics and Law in Wuhan, capital of Hubei province. ""The government should emphasize education in this field from childhood."" A 24-year-old female student of English literature from Xiamen University in Fujian province urged the government to open channels where harassment complaints can be made, and said awareness should be improved among men and boys in the country. Her university has been offering some safety lessons, ""warning girls of the dangers they may meet in this regard"", she added. In essence, these students want anti-harassment offices to be set up on university campuses. A law student, 25, from China University of Political Science and Law in Beijing, said she was harassed by a man in his 50s during her internship at a company where he worked. She said she saw no reason why universities should not have ""zero tolerance"" for sexual misconduct by faculty members, adding that many students keep quiet, fearing the fallout on their academic careers from trying to expose the transgressions of their teachers. Liang Tao, 23, who is studying biomedical engineering at Zhejiang University, said he will pay closer attention to women's rights now that he knows more about them from the online discussions. One of his female classmates was harassed on a bus, he added. Empathy for survivors and anger toward perpetrators has always existed in society, he said. ""But in the past, there was no social media and people's awareness was low."" Another male interviewee, Lian Dashuai, 25, from Southeast University in Nanjing, Jiangsu province, said women who speak out against their harassers usually do so once they are well away from them. Lian, who is studying preventive medicine, sees the related discussions, especially in Chinese universities, as a positive development. Both the male students and also Zhang Zepeng, who is studying at Zhejiang University of Finance and Economics, feel that younger Chinese men have a better understanding of gender equality－they do not view women as ""inferior"". The male interviewees also said they support the online conversations. Drawing a slightly different picture of the modern Chinese man, two female students said during the interviews that their partners appeared indifferent to their plight when they told them about incidents of sexual misconduct they had experienced in the past. For one female university student from Jiangsu, the importance of awareness can never be overstated. ""My family told me not to live with my boyfriend,"" she said of the conservative approach some parents have toward live-in relationships in China. ""But they failed to tell me how to respond to sexual assault,"" she said, alleging that an older male relative had assaulted her in a different area of China years ago."
1,"Ecole du Ski Francais, a top ski school from Europe, has unveiled its academy in Beijing, adding one more choice for kids and adults in China to receive world-class, safe and quality courses starting this winter. Gino Andreetta, CEO of Club Med China, an international holiday firm and the partner of ESF in Beijing, said the Chinese snow market was one not to be missed. ""We decided to support the country's plan to have 300 million people on the snow (by 2022), we know in China only 20 percent of people will come back after trying skiing for the first time,"" he said. ""We think safety is a top concern, as well as experience, and that's why we created this academy with a very strong partner－ESF, one of the largest and oldest ski schools."" He said the group will continue to promote winter sports, as he observed Chinese millennial families are eager to embrace new experiences. An active lifestyle is gradually becoming an increasingly significant part of people's lives. The government too sees it as an important strategy to raise both citizens' quality of life and generate new economic consumption. In January, the General Administration of Sport and the National Development and Reform Commission released an action plan to increase sport-related consumption to 1.5 trillion yuan ($223 billion) by 2020. Many see the goal as a golden opportunity, not least the snow sports industry. An Fuxiu, founder of Sportbank, a Beijing-based sports industry consultancy, said both local authorities and investors see the entire sport industry as a very promising sector, with winter sports the most important part of that. ""We keep close contact with the GAS and various businesses, and we have seen the winter sport sector soar in recent years,"" she said. ""Both the Ministry of Education and local authorities have beneficial policies, for example, in land supply or education programs in primary and middle schools."" According to research by Wu Bin, general manager of Beijing Carving Ski Equipment, and Wei Qinghua, chairman of Beijing Antaeus Ski, a total of 21 million visits to ski venues in China were made last year, up 14.4 percent from 2017. With 39 new ski venues opening, the country was home to 742 snow venues by the end of 2018. The research found 75 percent of skiers tried the facilities as a one-off last year, while 22 percent of them, mainly locals, would come back frequently. The report also observed some dramatic annual growth for some non-conventional winter sport provinces. Yunnan and Guangdong provinces saw 100 percent and 167 percent more trips to ski venues in 2018, respectively. Zhejiang province was also among the top six most popular ski destinations last year, along with the more traditional wintry areas of Heilongjiang, Hebei and other northern regions. While the number of snow venues continued to grow, An anticipated the rate will slow in 2019. ""The growth rate for snow venues, total skiers and ski-related investment will keep momentum but at a slower pace,"" An said, adding that ice venues will continue to pop up, as they are much more cost-friendly and require less natural resources. ""The biggest bottleneck is energy consumption. For example, Beijing hasn't snowed yet this winter, so obviously all the Beijing ski venues were using artificial snow and burning energy to make them cold,"" An said. ""Thus, it is a key strategy to build attractive ski resorts in places like the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region and the northeastern provinces."" ""Having real snow is a massive, unbeatable advantage, and it is an efficient way to lift the local economy－especially in rust belt areas in Northeast China,"" she said. Andreetta also believed that snow sports can power the local economy in the Northeast region. Club Med owns two snow resorts in Heilongjiang and Jilin. ""In northern cities, one of the main businesses for locals is agriculture, which is not that productive in winter,"" he said. ""Working in snow resorts will give them new jobs in winter. We believe mountain travel can bring ecological achievement."""
0,"Hua Xiaoyi, a long-haired beauty, has the image traditionally associated with a Chinese classical dancer. However, the 25-year-old Hua is going against her long career as a Chinese classical dancer and will stage her first contemporary dance work, titled Every Moment, in Beijing on Oct 31 and Nov 1 before heading to Shanghai on Nov 21 and 22.  Consisting of four sections, the dance work is choreographed by three artists, including Chinese choreographers Gao Chengming, Lou Menghan and British choreographer-dancer Akram Khan.  From different perspectives, the three choreographers explore the identities of women.  ""In my past works, I have portrayed different female roles. But with this work, I want to be myself,"" says Hua. ""Every Moment displays some significant moments from my life, which are subtle but powerful to me. I hope that the audiences will look back at their own special moments after watching this work.""  In 2013, as the top student in her class, Hua went to study at the Purchase College in New York as an exchange student for three months, where she received training in contemporary dance and ballet.  Besides training, Hua also watched a variety of performances in New York.  One of the shows, Desh, by Akram Khan, changed her view about dancing.  Recalling the performance, Hua says: ""In one and a half hours, he displays himself through rich dancing vocabularies, which are independent and interesting. I want to dance like him.      ""For the first time, I start thinking about talking about myself through dancing.""  About a year ago, she initiated her idea of Every Moment, which was supported by Xu Rui, the vice president of Beijing Dance Academy.  As the director of the dance work, Xu helped Hua to contact Khan, inviting him to choreograph for Hua.  Hua flew to Moscow in July to meet Khan, when he performed his piece, Until the Lions there.  ""I was thrilled that he agreed to choreograph for me after watching the videos of my dancing,"" says Hua, who traveled to London to meet Khan again to do a rehearsal.  Born in Dalian, in Liaoning province, Hua was introduced to Chinese classical dance by her parents, both dance lovers.  In 2004, she came to Beijing to study at the affiliated school of the Beijing Dance Academy and later study Chinese classical dance at the Beijing Dance Academy.  She is a two-time winner of the Tao Li Cup, the top dance honor for young Chinese professional dancers, in 2009 and 2012.  Now, Hua is a member of the dance troupe of the Beijing Dance Academy.  ""It's not easy to change my dance language from Chinese classical dance to contemporary dance. I don't want to give up my past experience with Chinese classical dance. I want to combine these two forms of dancing,"" says Hua."

0,"To better regulate the internet and online operators, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism has begun monitoring more closely the activities of online animation and music streaming providers. An upcoming investigation will target 27 major video and music streaming websites, including Bilibili, an anime-centered video streaming platform widely accessed by teens; Kuaikan, a digital publishing platform for comic strips; and Douyin, a short video streaming app. On July 20, China Central Television criticized animation video websites, digital comic sites and anime-related WeChat official accounts for hosting vulgar and pornographic content. Calling out Bilibili by name, the CCTV report criticized the site for scantily clad characters, sexually suggestive images and even incestuous content found in some of its animated series, with a few even being recommended as editors' picks. Following the report's accusations, law enforcement teams acting under the authority of the ministry targeted online operators in Beijing and Shanghai, launched a crackdown on illegal operations of Shanghai Kuanyu Digital Technology Co Ltd, the company behind Bilibili, and Kuaikan World (Beijing) Technology Co Ltd, the company behind the comic strip platform. The ministry ordered 11 major online animation platforms to reinforce self-censorship via inspections of their content and to clean up offensive products. So far, 977 videos and 167 comic series have been withdrawn. Sanctions also target music streaming platforms that provide illegal content, including songs glorifying fascism and militarism. The MCT has instructed relevant law enforcement departments in Beijing, as well as Zhejiang and Guangdong provinces, to keep a record of ongoing cases and implement administrative penalties where warranted. In the meantime, 18 major music streaming sites have reportedly begun self-censorship operations. Content suspected of being in violation of laws and regulations has been taken down, including 4,664 songs, more than 100,000 videos, 891 playlists, 4,300 user comments and over 4,500 user profiles. He Yun'ao, a professor at Nanjing University and a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said: ""The cultural market essentially serves the spiritual pursuit of humans and the development of civilization. Therefore, online companies in the cultural sphere should prioritize social benefits over economic interests."" The ministry said that in order to further strengthen supervision over the internet, a centralized and comprehensive investigation into the 27 targeted companies will soon be conducted. If illegal products are found-including obscene, pornographic, morally indefensible and violence-or crime-inducing content-the ministry will impose penalties and publish the results."

Beijing Youth Daily reported that defaulters were not only limited to tourism, such as tourists and tour guides, but also included dishonest people in other sectors, such as finance. The platform, which started construction on March 30, 2017, has so far collected and stored 170 million entries of credit information concerning 44,690 tour guides, 2,672 travel agencies, 281 key tourist attractions and 559 starred hotels in Beijing, with a plan to create a comprehensive credit archive of tour guides and tourism-related businesses. Further linked to other public and enterprise information platforms in Beijing, Credit Beijing can share credit information, issue notices and warnings, allow the filing of tour complaints and more. ""Tourists may research the credit records of tour guides and businesses via the official website, Wechat account and app to know their economic and social reputations and identify the unscrupulous ones,"" an official from the Beijing Tourism Association said. ""People who have failed to fulfill court orders will be banned from starred hotels and expensive shopping tours. Stricter scrutiny will be imposed on defaulters who apply for travel agency licenses or tour guide certificates,"" the official said. ""The practice will play a positive role in building a healthy business ecosystem, safeguarding the legitimate interests of tourists and further regulating the market order,"" he added. Besides tougher regulations on those working in tourism, the uncivilized behavior of tourists will also be recorded in the platform and posted online. The credit information platform in Beijing will expand to cover Tianjin and Hebei province in the future, as a joint memorandum of understanding to build an integrated travel credit system was signed on Tuesday."
1,"The number of Chinese tourists visiting Ireland could reach 175,000 in 2025, more than double that in 2017, according to Tourism Ireland. About 70,000 Chinese visitors went to Ireland last year, up about 15 percent year on year, according to Niall Gibbons, chief executive of Tourism Ireland. ""China is one of Ireland's fastest growing tourism source markets, and the growth rate is likely to double in the near future,"" he added. Gibbons made the remarks at the ongoing Tourism Ireland annual travel China Sales Mission event. It will tour Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Hong Kong with the aim of sealing more partnerships and deals with local counterparts to bring more Chinese tourists to the island. A total of 20 Irish tourism market players including travel agencies, hotels and popular destinations like Guinness Storehouse, have joined this year's China Sales Mission, the largest ever held by Tourism Ireland. ""That points to increasing importance as well as our confidence of the Chinese outbound travel market,"" Gibbons said. To cater to the growing inflow of Chinese tourists, Tourism Ireland and Irish tourism partners have launched the China Ready training program, which is designed to help Irish tourism firms grab business opportunities in China such as introducing popular mobile payment tools like WeChat. Starting from June, Chinese visitors can take direct flights operated by Hainan Airlines or Cathay Pacific Airways to Dublin, either from Beijing or Hong Kong. Official data showed that China-Ireland trade volume exceeded $10 billion last year, up 36.7 percent year on year. ""With the opening of the two direct flights, plus growing bilateral trade, there is every indication of the continuous growth of Chinese visitors into next year and beyond,"" Gibbons said."

""Difficulties can arise from the fact that many manufacturers don't have effective access to such science professionals, meaning they have to search very hard and take on high costs,"" said Zhi Qiang, who runs the online platform. ""Many scientists are conducting good research in institutions and universities, but often don't know how they can put their academic findings into practice,"" Zhi said. ""Only a fraction of the scientists have started their own businesses with their findings, though the country has been encouraging them to combine their academic work with business."" With big data technologies, ScientistIn is able to track every update of the registered scientists' academic work. When a registered company announces its need for technical solutions, the platform will send the request to the most suitable scientists. As such, the platform improves the efficiency of cooperation between scientists and companies, according to Zhi. He holds a public af air management PhD from Beijing-based Tsinghua University. The platform has a vast online database of scientists and experts from around the world, who are mostly Chinese. More than half of the researchers are active on the ScientistIn platform, according to Zhi. His company has also helped Zhejiang to formulate a talent map of local scientists and experts, including their locations and subjects of study.   ScientistIn is one of the dozens of companies that have been incubated by the Yangtze River Delta Region Institute of Tsinghua University, based in Jiaxing, according to Zhang Haige, vice-president of the institute. Supported by the Zhejiang provincial government and Tsinghua University, the institute was founded in 2003. Many Chinese universities have established such institutes to better serve the local economy, but the Jiaxing-based one differs from the others partly because it doesn't rely on government financing, Zhang said. ""It has been adopting a market-oriented model. We receive funds from investors, with which we can invest in incubating startups, so that we can receive dividends,"" Zhang said.

Beijing will honor its promise made in the candidature phase to host athlete-centered Winter Olympic Games in 2022 by providing welcoming services for athletes and striving for their best benefit during the Games, said Yang, a member of the 13th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, from the sideline of the meeting's opening session on Saturday. ""To meet the demands of participating athletes plays a big part in the success of hosting the Olympics. We hope to turn every athlete into our promoter in 2022 by providing them the best services as we can,"" said Yang, the chairwoman of the Athletes' Commission of Beijing 2022 and a former International Olympic Committee member. To better guide its preparation toward the athletes' needs, the Beijing 2022 organizing committee established an athletes' commission consisting of 21 members in November. Yang said the commission will get involved in every aspect of organizational work, including accommodation, catering, transport and venue operation. To guarantee enough tickets for every athlete's family so they can cheer for their loved ones on site is one of the key services the commission is trying to provide, said Yang. Meanwhile, Beijing 2022 also attaches great importance in the post-Olympics operation of legacies in facilities and expertise, Yang added. ""As long as our national strategy to involve 300 million people in winter sports rolls out successfully, we don't need to worry about the use of abundant winter sports infrastructures after the Games,"" she said. To make sure Chinese athletes' performances are as successful as the organizational work, the country's winter sports governing body has been pulling out all the stops to build teams in winter sports that they've never participated in, expand its prowess to once-niche events and strengthen its dominance in traditional strong events. The aim is that Chinese athletes will compete in all 102 events at the 2022 Winter Olympics, Yang said."
1,"Some 300,000 visitors are expected in Shanghai for the inaugural China International Import Expo, one of the major flagship events to be held in the country this year. More than 2,800 companies, including 200 Fortune Global 500 ones, from 130 countries will be taking part in the six-day event, which begins on Monday. The Shanghai expo, which will be held annually, is set to demonstrate clearly to an international audience that the nation's economy is no longer purely the ""Made in China"" manufacturing powerhouse of recent years, but is now driven by consumers who want to buy what the world has to offer. Against a backdrop of increasing international trade tensions, it is also aimed at demonstrating that China is open for business as the country marks the 40th anniversary of reform and opening-up. Sherri He, a partner at management consultants AT Kearney's Shanghai office, said it is probably the biggest import-related event ever staged. The scale of the Shanghai expo is much greater than that of the Canton Fair, which has been held twice a year in Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong province, since 1957. ""That would be a comparison point, but that (the Canton Fair) is for both imports and exports. This (the Shanghai expo) is probably the first-ever global import event,"" she said. The exhibitors include a wide range of companies, from those showcasing their expertise in high-end technologies such as industrial robots, machine tools, artificial intelligence and advanced healthcare, to those selling food and luxury consumer goods. The main goal for some will be to get close to the Chinese middle-class consumer, whose growth in terms of numbers is set to be one of the global economic megatrends of the coming decades. According to global management consultants McKinsey& Co, the country's middle class could increase to 630 million by 2022, almost double the current US population of 327 million. German carmaker BMW is among the high-profile exhibitors. It reconfirmed its commitment to the China market by announcing last month that it would pay 3.6 billion euros ($4.2 billion) to take majority control of its China joint venture with Brilliance China Automotive Holdings. BMW is taking advantage of new rules designed to open up China's automotive sector to foreign players announced by President Xi Jinping at the Boao Forum in Hainan province in April. Jochen Goller, president and CEO of BMW Group Region China, said one of the expo's aims is to highlight Chinese consumers' need to upgrade, which he hopes his company can meet through its leading position in autonomous driving and electric cars. ""(This) greatly resonates with the core purpose of the CIIE. We believe the expo is a platform to demonstrate our long-term commitment as well as our confidence to grow with China,"" he said. However, exhibitors will be well aware that the Chinese consumer market, although potentially lucrative, is not an easy one to crack.,Alina Ma, associate research director in Shanghai for market research company Mintel, said that simply being foreign is no longer such an attraction to Chinese consumers. ""This may have been the case 10 years ago, but no longer. Chinese consumers have now traveled abroad and have a lot of experience. They are particularly savvy when it comes to buying online,"" she said. ""They like to compare and contrast product features, and they often find that Chinese products offer what they need and are also value for money."" Ma said the country's consumers are also increasingly seeking products with Chinese heritage or value. ""This applies to younger consumers as much as older ones and poses another challenge for foreign companies."" Mats Harborn, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, whose Shanghai chapter will release its position paper on the expo on Friday, said 60 percent of its members thought Chinese products were now equally or more innovative than their own. ""It is a signal I want companies to send back to their headquarters. They need to wake up and put their resources in China,"" he said. According to official data, China's imports are now an important driver of the global economy, with the world's second-largest economy being also the second-largest importer of goods for nine consecutive years, making up 10.2 percent of global imports last year. China's imports of goods in 2017 rose to $1.74 trillion, up by 16 percent on the previous year, whereas its exports rose by 11.4 percent to more than $2.21 trillion. Louis Kuijs, head of Asia Economics for consultancy Oxford Economics in Hong Kong, said the rebalancing away from exports toward consumption and is one of the most important economic trends globally. ""Domestic demand in China continues to grow faster than in the rest of the world, which means imports are going to be increasingly pulled in by China,"" he said. Despite the rhetoric coming from US President Donald Trump's administration about China's trade surplus with his country, its surplus with the rest of the world is disappearing, Kuijs said. He forecast that the current account surplus of 1.3 percent of GDP last year will fall to just 0.1 percent this year and may soon even become a deficit. ""If it happens, it will be a milestone and a lot will be written about it. China already has a deficit with some economies and countries in Asia which are part of China's Asian supply chain involving imports of large volumes of components. It also imports raw materials from countries like Australia. Increasing imports will mean that its current overall surplus will disappear."" The expo is taking place as China marks the 40th anniversary of reform and opening-up. Leon Wang, executive vice-president, international, and China president at AstraZeneca, the UK-headquartered pharmaceuticals multinational, which is an exhibitor in Shanghai, said, ""At a time when China is celebrating its 40th anniversary of reform and opening-up, it is of greater significance for the country to host this international event in Shanghai. ""It shows not only the rise of China under this policy, but also presents a national image that it is open, inclusive and reciprocal."" China is the company's biggest market after the US, and Wang said rising incomes are leading the country's middle class, in particular, to demand better healthcare. ""With higher economic growth and personal incomes, people are demanding more and better healthcare. The needs for precise, personalized and smart treatment with affordable and accessible healthcare services are increasing,"" he said. ""We have delved deep into the China market and increasing investment. (We are) focusing on therapy areas where Chinese patients have the most urgent demand,"" he said. The expo is also likely to illustrate how imports are important in driving the country's industrial modernization and achieving goals, such as Made in China 2025, and becoming a global technology leader by 2035. It particularly wants to move ahead in advanced manufacturing, robotics and artificial intelligence. Denis Depoux, CEO for Greater China with management consultants Roland Berger, said advancing technology is generally a collaborative effort. ""Imports make sense from a multiple standpoint, but one of the most underlying is their role in the modernization of the Chinese industrial footprint in terms of technology transfers and in other respects."" Depoux, who is also the consultancy's deputy head for Asia, said China also needs imports to fill gaps in its technology deficits, despite its overall ambitious plans. ""You can decide overnight that you want to be a producer of aircraft engines or gas turbines, but from that moment to actually achieving it could have a lead time of 20 to 30 years. In the meantime, China, like many other nations, will keep importing these high-end products."",Mary Ma, general secretary in Shanghai for leading independent think tank the Center for China and Globalization, believes the expo can be compared with the Great Exhibition staged in London in the middle of the 19th century, and is a major opportunity for importers to showcase their products. ""Many have said it provides a 'six plus 365 opportunity' - you exhibit at the show for six days and then you can sell online for 365 days. This is particularly the case with November 11 (Singles Day - China's equivalent to Black Friday in the US - when online goods are heavily discounted) coming up,"" she said. Ma, who returned to China last year after working in Chicago for the International Trade Centre in Illinois on promoting exports to the country, said the purchasing power of younger people in China is something of a phenomenon. ""The one thing I noticed when I came back was the number of 20-to 30-year-olds in the shopping malls of Shanghai and Beijing. This is a huge market and I am not sure if the foreign brands do their best to reach it, particularly online."" Joseph Healy, CEO at specialist lender Judo Capital in Melbourne, Australia, and author of Chinese Firms Going Global: Can They Succeed?, said the changing nature of China's imports is beginning to have an effect on traditional resource exporters such as Australia. ""It used to be just an exporter of raw materials, but that is shifting. China's growing middle class is a wonderful opportunity for Australia and New Zealand's dairy products, wines and other products,"" he said. ""On a political level, however, Australia has been pathetic in terms of engaging with this opportunity and has come across at times as quite disrespectful."" Depoux, at Roland Berger, believes the expo will be a major opportunity for some of the countries - along with the Belt and Road Initiative - who have not exported to China before. ""I am thinking, in particular, of Central Asia and agricultural exports, but this might also be an opportunity for some African and South American countries to try to establish a market position in China,"" he said. However, he insists that while this market has huge potential, it also has its unique challenges. ""It is a very complex, fragmented and very fast-moving market. It often changes so fast that by the time you are thinking about moving in, it has changed again."" With trade tensions escalating, many expo participants hope the event will demonstrate the importance of open trade. Wang, at AstraZeneca, is confident that it will send an important signal. ""We greatly admire the foresight of the Chinese leadership in uniting the world ever more closely by hosting such an international event. China is an important engine for global economic growth and prosperity, and I am pleased the Chinese government supports globalization and free trade,"" he said. Wang Huiyao, president and founder of the Center for China and Globalization, agrees that the expo is a major opportunity for companies worldwide. ""China wants to buy more. It doesn't want a trade surplus. This event is very significant and represents a major shopping opportunity for the Chinese,"" he said."
1,"UBS, the giant Swiss global financial services firm, is honoring its promise to support the annual Beijing Music Festival by sponsoring high-quality performances.  To mark the 20th anniversary of the Beijing Music Festival and 14 years of partnership with the BMF, UBS is sponsoring a special concert featuring world-renowned British vocal ensemble, The King's Singers.  ""We are delighted that The King's Singers have come to the Beijing Music Festival to stage a unique concert of songs by French and Russian composers, as well as American Jazz and Chinese folksongs,"" said Eugene Qian, the chairman of UBS' China strategy board.  ""The BMF is already the most influential art festival in the Asia-Pacific region. It has not only provided quality cultural experiences, but also offered a benchmark for the sector in its professionalism and trend-setting leadership,"" BMF artistic director Yu Long told a news conference.  He added that UBS had always been committed to fostering the development of art, which was highly consistent with the aims of the BMF. UBS, it said, was not only a sponsor but also a leader in supporting the arts and culture.  Before The King's Singers, UBS worked with the BMF, sponsoring concerts performed by world-class pianists Li Yundi and Zhu Xiaomei and the organist, Cameron Carpenter, to name but a few.  The King's Singers bass, Jonathan Howard, said his group was glad to see the BMF working with UBS, a music ambassador and global pioneer. ""For us, The King's Singers also tries to be ambassador for music of all kinds, all over the world,"" he added.  The King's Singers were formed on May 1, 1968, by six recently-graduated choral scholars from King's College, Cambridge.  Their vocal lineup was formed by chance and developed into two countertenors, a tenor, two baritones and a bass, and the group has never wavered from this vocal balance. Two Grammy Awards, an Emmy Award, and a place in Gramophone magazine's inaugural Hall of Fame sit among the numerous accolades bestowed upon the group.  Asked how they work with each other to produce their rich, distinctive sound, Christopher Gobbitas, answers that they draw from their different experiences to create a single product.  Eugene Qian, chairman of UBS' China strategy board, said there were parallels between how his organization in the music festival worked. ""Just as the BMF brings artists from all over the world to create an overall experience, UBS takes people with different talents and specialties from all around the world and brings them together to create a better service,"" he said. Qian added that professionalism and collaboration were crucial for both art and business. ""It is our professionalism and collaboration that has led to great success in China for UBS.""  This fall, the BMF commemorates an important milestone, its 20th anniversary.  Rather than focus on specific composers such as Wagner, Strauss, or Verdi as in previous festivals, this year's theme is ""BMF at 20.""  The 22-day festival, lasting from Oct 8 to 29, is consist of 29 events  Established in 1998, the BMF has blazed an extraordinary trail over the past 20 years, during which time classical music in Beijing and its citizens' cultural life have experienced dramatic transformation.  The BMF has always played an important role.  Striving for continual growth and improvement, with strong support and under the leadership of its hosts – the Ministry of Culture and the Beijing municipal government – the BMF has established itself as a vital cultural spectacle in the capital and as a flagship event in the country's public culture. Qian said that the UBS Group in China grew strongly in the first three quarters of the current year.  ""Especially the wealth management business and investment banking businesses, which China is a key contributor to the global business map,"" Qian added.  Meanwhile, as the first Qualified Domestic Limited Partner (QDLP) to receive a private fund management license in China, UBS was recently authorized to offer private funds, which will also benefit wealth management. The license represents a significant milestone in UBS's progress in China.  UBS says its business in China contributes more and more to the growth of the firm's Asia-Pacific business and even UBS's global business. However, this is only the beginning, according to Qian.  As for further development in China, he had growing confidence for steady and sound expansion in the country.  ""As one of the biggest beneficiaries of the reform and opening-up, UBS knows well about China's economy and society,"" he said.  ""We are convinced that with the beginning of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, China will be more prepared to integrate with the global economy, and develop into the most important economy that boosts internationalization and multilateralism,"" Qian added.  With its huge confidence in the Belt and Road Initiative, UBS has already set up its own Belt and Road taskforce. This pays close attention to the business opportunities brought by the initiative and helps domestic enterprises to go global, according to Qian."
1,"To outsiders, Taonan looks like an ordinary county-level city with few opportunities, but local college graduates, especially girls, have become role models. Since 2014, the poverty-stricken city in Jilin province has seen 37 women with college degrees return from big cities to start careers or build businesses. It all began with one woman, Wang He. Wang, 36, was a teacher and educational agency owner in Tianjin. In 2014, she had the idea of starting a cooperative in her hometown, Taonan, selling mung beans online. Taonan is a major mung bean distribution center in China. Most of the beans wholesale at around 50 yuan ($7.30) per metric ton. In the beginning, Wang followed the standard model, but after three months few beans had been sold. Later, along with five female colleagues, Wang decided to grow organic mung beans and sell select products to high-end markets. They also created a brand called ""Tao Bao"", meaning treasure of Taonan. Wang and her team traveled to cities such as Beijing and Shanghai to promote their products in supermarkets. Business took off in the second year after several high-end supermarkets accepted their products. A bag of beans weighing 400 grams now sells for 30 yuan, and Wang has signed contracts with more than 50 farmers in her hometown to grow organic products. That has brought in more than 3 million yuan for the farmers. ""Our income has doubled by cooperating with Wang,"" said Chen Feng, a local farmer. To encourage business, the local government leased an old 20,000-square-meter factory to them as a working venue, at no cost to Wang. As Wang's fame grew in Taonan, more local female college graduates joined the venture. ""Cramming in the subway and sitting all day in a cubicle is not the life I wanted,"" said Jiao Qi, 30, who had a white-collar job in Shanghai. Jiao left Shanghai in 2014 to become Wang's assistant. ""Selling beans may sound unimportant, but I can find my inner freedom here building my own career,"" she said. Casting aside her well-ironed white blouses, Jiao often wears loose floral dresses to attend various local events. Young graduates like Jiao can now start their own businesses in the factory thanks to Wang's support. Zhang Zhongyue, a fresh graduate from China University of Political Science and Law in Beijing, returned to Taonan to attend to her sick father. She works for Tao Bao but also started her own trademark agency at the factory. ""If I went to a law firm in Beijing, I would probably be an assistant for the first few years,"" Zhang said. ""Here I am able to run my own business right after graduation."" Tao Bao offers registration capital, working venues and social connections in the factory for startups like Zhang's. ""The Girl Team is one of our brand characters. We want to prove that female self-starters can overcome challenges and build a career,"" Wang said."
0,"A new star-studded reality TV show is tapping into young Chinese people's love of basketball, Chen Nan reports. Chinese-American basketball player, Jeremy Lin has added a new string to his bow, landing his first role in a Chinese reality show, Dunk of China. ""Tipping off"" on Aug 18, the reality show, a co-production between video streaming platform Youku and Zhejiang Satellite TV, gathers more than 160 young Chinese amateur basketball players, who compete in rounds of 3-on-3 until one group is named the victor. The show will be aired weekly on both Youku and Zhejiang Satellite TV. Lin, the former LA Laker and current point guard for the Atlanta Hawks, along with Chinese celebrities including pop megastar Jay Chou from Taiwan, singer-actor Li Yifeng and national basketball team player Guo Ailun, will serve as one of the team captains in the reality show. The four celebrities will be divided into two groups and will lead the participants in their on-court showdowns.,The 29-year-old Lin is among the NBA's most popular players among fans in China. ""We've been seeing many talented and passionate young people in China who love basketball. They share my passion and dream about the game,"" says Lin in Beijing. Born to Taiwan immigrants and growing up in San Francisco, Lin earned himself the title of Northern California player of the year as a senior in high school. With no athletic scholarship offers, he attended Harvard University where he was an all-conference player in the Ivy League. Before the trappings of fame and NBA stardom found him, Lin was undrafted after college and slept on the couch in the living room of his brother's small apartment. ""In my career, I've experienced some bad moments but I always remind myself of my dream about playing basketball as a young boy,"" says Lin, adding that through the reality show, he not only wants to showcase the basketball playing techniques but also demonstrate the power of persistence. Lin says that he agreed to join in the show because of his friendship with Chou. In 2016, Lin appeared in Chou's music video for his song Turkish Ice Cream, which was recorded for Chou's 14th studio album, Jay Chou's Bedtime Stories. The music video, which has Lin playing the piano and even showing off some dance moves, received over 5 million views on You-Tube. Chou, 39, who wears many hats as a singer, songwriter, movie director and businessman, has displayed his love for basketball since high school. Back in 2000, on his debut album, Jay, he wrote and sang a song about a 3-on-3 basketball game, titled Basketball Match. He also starred in Chinese action-comedy movie, Kung Fu Dunk, in 2008. He made his Hollywood debut in 2011 with The Green Hornet, starring alongside Seth Rogen and Christoph Waltz as the eponymous hero's sidekick, Kato. In 2016, he played a role in the Hollywood movie, Now You See Me 2.,In 2013, Chou played one-on-one with NBA legend Kobe Bryant in Shanghai. This June, he co-launched JYB League, a 3-on-3 competition, which offers amateur players a platform to play the game. ""I'm not a professional basketball player, but I have been playing since I was a teenager. I was one of the members of my school team,"" says Chou in Beijing. ""I dreamed about getting off the bench and into the game. Though I didn't have the chance, I still love the game and continue to play recreationally. ""I can still recall the screams of the girls when the school team played on the basketball court and the music was loud. When we shot the reality show, it reminded me of my school years."" This summer, Youku offered comprehensive coverage of the FIFA 2018 World Cup with live streaming of all 64 games, which attracted about 200 million viewers, as well as a number of programs produced exclusively to celebrate one of the world's most-watched sporting events. Dunk of China is one of the reality shows under the This Is... series by Youku, aimed at showcasing Chinese youth culture. Other shows include This Is Fighting Robots and Street Dance of China. According to Yi Hua, producer of Dunk of China, the reality show will offer the audience professional basketball knowledge, music and youth culture. ""We have been preparing the show for over a year and carried out more than 10,000 surveys on basketball culture in China. We found out that it is one of the most popular sports in the country, catering to people of different ages, occupations and regions,"" says Yi in Beijing. ""This show is aimed at showcasing the vitality of young Chinese people rather than producing stars like many other Chinese reality shows."" She also mentions that besides the NBA, young audiences, especially those who were born after 1980, grew up reading Slam Dunk, a sports-themed manga series written and illustrated by Japanese artist Takehiko Inoue, which is a from-failure-to-success story of a Japanese high school basketball team.,""Dunking is always the most amazing moment on the basketball court,"" Yi says. ""It's about courage, confidence and teamwork."" Besides being broadcast online, the show is set to visit more than 200 universities in China this summer, to offer a wider platform to young Chinese basketball lovers, Yi adds. The producer says that the 3-on-3 game is gaining in popularity in China, which is why the reality show is based on the format. Last June, the International Olympic Committee approved the addition of a 3-on-3 basketball tournament to the 2020 Summer Olympics, which will be held in Tokyo. Moreover, in January, the Chinese Basketball Association announced it would stage another national 3-on-3 tournament in the buildup to the Tokyo Olympics, which will be open to amateurs and professionals alike. The winning team will also have the chance to play at the Games. CBA president Yao Ming said at a news conference for the Road to Olympics－National 3-on-3 Basketball Tournament in Beijing this January, that he believes 3-on-3 has opened a new window of opportunity for Chinese basketball, because it is an emerging form of basketball that is new to almost every country in the world.

0,"It has been 10 years since the 2008 Beijing Olympics, but for many the memory of the sports extravaganza will always remain fresh, especially the event's torchbearers. Nearly 100 representatives of Beijing Olympic torchbearers across China gathered in the city this Thursday to celebrate the Games' 10th anniversary, and revisited the Beijing National Stadium, also known as the Bird's Nest, which was designed for use as the main stadium throughout the 2008 Summer Olympics and Paralympics. Reuniting the torchbearers also provided an opportunity to share the charity efforts by the group. Zhang Faqiang, the honorary chairman of the Beijing Torchbearers Association and former deputy director of the General Administration of Sport of China, expressed his gratitude for all the charity efforts by different torchbearer organizations across China. The Chinese Olympic men's shooting gold medalist Yang Ling also came to the celebration, saying that he was very happy to meet all the torchbearers and hoped to see all his friends again at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. Huang Haijun, the chairman of the China Torchbearers Federation and Beijing Torchbearers Association, said that for the past year, the association has participated in many charity programs, including care projects for the students in rural areas. Huang also stressed that for the past decade, many torchbearer charity organizations have been established, helping a huge number of people in need and earning the trust and recognition of many."
1,"Over 240 bookstores from 85 cities around China are jointly exploring better ways to survive. As part of this initiative, salons are being held in cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Suzhou and Chengdu to discuss how to maintain the traditional bookselling business while venturing into music, films, exhibitions and cultural products. And besides brand chains that have long been cultivating their unique strengths, attention is also being paid to independent bookstores. So far, hundreds of readers, booksellers and 26 renowned Chinese publishers have met in various cities for this month-long series of events named Hello Bookstore. Also, readers are invited to experience working at a bookstore for eight hours and some 20 renowned authors have been invited to share their stories about reading and their observations about physical bookstores. The ultimate goal, according to Chen Zifeng, the marketing director of the Guangxi Normal University Press Group, the organizer, is to lure readers back into bookstores. ""We want to mobilize readers and resources from the publishing industry to build up a platform that is centered on physical bookstores"", says Chen at the launch of Hello Bookstore events. This is the third year that the Guangxi Normal University Press Group, which operates its own bookstores, has organized themed events of this kind. Liu Gui, the general manager of Future Bookstore Co Ltd, says that publishers and bookstores are dependent on one another, and that this is exemplified by publishers providing books based on the bookstores' features and targeted groups, while bookstores support publishers by making payments in time. Lin Gengli, the founder of Sendpoints Books, says that in an era when books are more diverse, bookstores and publishers should be more open, innovative and inclusive when dealing with paper books, e-books and audio books. Meanwhile, explaining his philosophy of creating and producing cultural products, Wang Bowen, the general manager of Joint Publishing Company International, a company jointly funded by the Sanlian companies in Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong, says: ""Cultural products are not only of practical use but also make good gifts."""
1,"BEIJING－Every now and then, Li Shuang stands by the window of her office and looks out over the incessant stream of traffic on the Third Ring Road of Beijing. The 36-year-old still remembers when cars were rare in the country. ""When I was a child, if someone drove a vehicle, he would receive others' admiration,"" said Li, the CEO of a cultural and creative company. After 40 years of reform and opening-up, China has transformed itself from a land of bicycles to a global automobile market, where a wide range of car brands and models can be seen on the roads. It has become more and more common for Chinese families to purchase a second or a third car. Automobiles have greatly extended the sphere of Chinese people's lives. But more than that, they have become a symbol of individuality. Driving in her imported SUV Volkswagen Touareg, which cost 800,000 yuan (more than $125,000), Li Shuang has made long road trips from Beijing to Southwest China's Tibet autonomous region four times since 2014. One night in 2015, Li encountered a huge storm on her way from Golmud to Lhasa, the regional capital. ""Without street lights, I was not sure whether my car had deviated from the planned route or not,"" Li recalled. ""Then the car was stuck in heavy snow, which left me desperate."" Fortunately for Li, with the aid of People's Liberation Army soldiers nearby, she and her car were dragged out of the snow. From that point on, her car was more than a vehicle for her－it was a friend that accompanied her through thick and thin. Li's story echoes the national story of China. In 1978, China started its reform and opening-up, which has enabled hundreds of millions of Chinese people to own private cars. By the end of 2016, the number of private cars in China had reached 165.59 million. According to newly released data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, China produced some 29 million automobiles last year and sold 28.9 million, ranking No 1 worldwide for nine years in a row. ""When the country has such a big amount of both auto production and consumption, it's time now to discuss the culture behind the booming industry,"" Li Shuang said. According to Beijing Auto Museum, automobile culture encompasses both the material and symbolic aspects of cars. Auto culture exists when cars go beyond transportation, and influence people's lives and social development. In 1994, China released its first automotive industry policy, encouraging private car purchases while forbidding local government sectors from intervening in people's legitimate car purchases or use through administrative or economic means. Since then, more Chinese families have been buying their first cars. Wang Chao, president of Kaiyun Motors, acknowledged that it was still too early for China to have its own car culture. ""Customers care more about the dynamic performance, appearance and cost performance of cars,"" Wang said. In China, there are vintage car collections that serve as a record of auto history and culture. ""But they are a minority interest,"" Wang said. China's top auto website Yiche.com received 151 million daily page views in the third quarter of 2017. Websites and smartphone apps provide information on new car releases, price comparisons and performance evaluation, while it's hard to find channels for automobile history and culture. Hongqi, a name that literally means red flag, is one of the best-known Chinese automobile brands. Jia Yanliang designed the shape and interior of its classic CA770 model in 1964. The 78-year-old senior said automobile culture has passed from generation to generation. ""China is seeing a lot of vehicle consumption,"" Jia said. ""We can see traffic jams in remote county towns."" ""The knowledge of brands' culture and background is still necessary for drivers if they really hope to know their cars,"" Jia said. In 1958, China assigned the task of manufacturing a high-end domestic sedan to the First Automobile Works, naming it Hongqi to celebrate China's 10th National Day in 1959. The sedan's logo featured Chairman Mao Zedong's calligraphy and a red flag. The CA77X range has been used as the National Day parade sedan and the vehicle for state guests ever since. While designing the sedan, Jia referenced the lines and edges of Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) furniture. ""Chinese traditional culture provides rich inspiration for domestic auto designers,"" Jia said."
0,"The number of visitors to the International Horticultural Exhibition in Beijing reached 35,000 by 7 pm on the event's opening day on Monday, according to the expo's coordination bureau. Early Monday morning, a flock of visitors formed a line as they waited to get into the park in Beijing's northwestern Yanqing district at the 9 am opening. The event continues for 161 additional days. Cai Qi, Party secretary of the capital and director of the expo's executive committee, announced the opening of the park in front of the China Pavilion, one of the main sites for horticultural exhibitions at the foot of the Great Wall. Near the entrance to the China Pavilion, a girl dressed like a flower helped draw tourists to visit. Wang Enlan, a 70-year-old Beijing resident, had spent a month planning a visit to the expo park on its opening day. She and her husband spent the night in Yanqing on Sunday, and she said they couldn't wait to get in. ""We drove about 60 kilometers from Xicheng district to see the big event, which is totally worth it,"" Wang said. ""I will bring my grandson to the expo during his summer vacation."" As an A1-level expo－the highest rank－the event has scheduled more than 2,500 activities of many kinds. It expects to see some 16 million visitors from home and abroad. More than 400 volunteers in blue and white uniforms were on duty on the first day in various places around the expo park. They provided many types of assistance, such as translation and giving directions. Jiang Zehui, chairwoman of the China Flower Association, said the opening means a lot to the horticulture industry since the exhibition hit a record high in terms of participating countries. Jiang, who spoke during a visit to INBAR Garden, which demonstrates bamboo and rattan's contribution to green development, said it also is a way to raise people's awareness about embracing a green lifestyle. Over 110 countries and international organizations as well as 120 nongovernmental organizations and provincial or local exhibitors are participating in the event. This is the second time China has hosted an A1-level horticulture expo, the first being in 1999 in Kunming, Yunnan province."
0,"BEIJING —Beijing's air pollution emergency response office issued a yellow alert for smog Thursday afternoon, forecasting the air pollution to persist till Saturday.  The yellow alert warned of an air quality index of more than 150 micrograms of harmful fine particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter of air for two consecutive days, according to the office.  Under China's four-tier warning system, red is the most severe, followed by orange, yellow and blue.  Low visibility has forced the city's transport bureau to close several highways out of the city starting Thursday morning.  Smog often becomes severe in late autumn and winter. However, China's Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP) warned in September that Beijing's smog is expected to arrive earlier this year.  Wang Shuxiao, professor at Tsinghua University and head of the Beijing Air Pollution Prevention and Monitoring Work Group, said stagnant air conditions have made air more humid.  He said that under similar conditions, Beijing previously would have seen very severe smog, but due to pollution control efforts, air pollution has been controlled and mitigated to a moderate level and lower.  Li Ganjie, environment minister, said earlier this week that the monthly average of PM 2.5 density in Beijing between March and August registered an all-time low for the same period.  To address the winter smog, MEP has launched a campaign against heavy air pollution in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and surrounding areas. It mainly focuses on curbing pollution from industrial enterprises, cutting coal consumption and improving emergency responses to heavy pollution."
1,"More than 200 motoring enthusiasts from across the globe went behind the wheels of their classic and vintage cars, including Bentleys, Porsches and Alfa Romeos, on Saturday in Beijing to gear up for an epic endurance drive from the Chinese capital to Paris. The 36-day rally, considered one of the world's toughest motoring challenges, stretches about 13,000 km and covers more than 10 countries and regions through the Asian continent and on to western Europe, including the harsh deserts of the Gobi and wide expanse of Siberia, according to event organizers. The first ""Peking to Paris"" motor rally was held in 1907 and took about two months. This is its seventh edition this year and retains one of its most striking characteristics -- the participants will be driving only cars manufactured before the late 1970s as they follow in the tracks of the rally pioneers. The vehicles are set to traverse gravel, sand and stunning mountain roads and plains, with motorists getting the chance to sleep in tents under the stars on the steppes of Mongolia. There are altogether 120 two-person teams taking on the challenge, which entry fee alone cost about $70,000. The teams roll out from the Juyongguan section of the Great Wall early Sunday and are expected to drive into Paris on July 7 through the finish line at the Place Vendome. There will be support and logistics groups, but the participants are expected to carry out regular maintenance on their own cars and obviously, stock important spare parts since the rare cars are very different from each other. Average daily distances to be covered are about 400 km but can be as much as 650 km. Briton Douglas McWilliams will be in his 1958 Bentley S1 model with his brother Mike McWilliams, a top-notch engineer who will lead the maintenance of their car as well as any repairs it needs on the journey. Modifications to their luxury car include strengthened suspension, a rebuilt gearbox and a new air filter for the engine. ""For us, the challenge is to take a car like this, a Bentley, across the Gobi Desert, a car that's more suited to maybe driving to the opera or going on a tour around London. So the car has been prepared quite specially for the rally. The route is very challenging, in Mongolia there are barely any roads at all,"" Mike told China Daily at a gathering point for the motorists in the Shangri-La Hotel, Beijing. Other than the obvious obstacles en route, Douglas, founder and deputy chairman of the London-based Centre for Economics and Business Research consultancy, also considers the experience important because he will be able to see for himself the areas that will be covered by the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative global infrastructure and development project. Douglas said he will personally assess the potential of these areas when they are linked up by better transport networks and improved trade facilities. He is writing a book about the rally and the BRI called ""Driving the Silk Road"". ""Mike and I were brought up in Malaysia and it used to be a frequent topic of discussion amongst the expatriates, about going back to the UK overland. We've always been excited by the prospects of being able to do it,"" he said. Now, with the Belt and Road Initiative and China helping to develop infrastructure connecting the East and West, Douglas said he would be able to make comparisons between the old and new trade routes. ""I'm fascinated by the Belt and Road Initiative, I think it's the most important infrastructure initiative ever. Being able to contrast the old-fashioned way of traveling across land to Europe with the newfangled ways now being created, it's such a wonderful opportunity,"" he said. Other rally vehicles range from a 1907 Contal Mototri Tricycle and 1930 Ford Model A, to a 1950 Oldsmobile 88 and 1975 Ferrari 208 GT4. Californian duo Kurht Gerhardt and Derek Boycks are driving a 1967 Porsche 912 model for the trip. ""I'm just ecstatic to be here. It's a dream come true,"" Boycks said. ""I can't believe the enthusiasm and the passion the local people are showing to these classic cars. It's just amazing … driving over here yesterday from the storage area, everybody's waving and taking videos. It was so welcoming and everybody's been really nice. We can't wait to see more of it."""
1,"According to the National Development and Reform Commission, the feasibility study of a section of the highway has been approved, which means the road is one step closer to completion.  The ring-shaped road, with a total length of 940 kilometers, will connect suburban Beijing with cities in Hebei province, including Zhangjiakou, a co-host city of the 2022 Winter Olympic Games.  Experts say the road will promote the joint development of Beijing, Tianjin – a port city close to Beijing – and Hebei province, and will also help ease traffic congestion and improve air quality of China's capital city.  Nicknamed the ""seventh ring road"" after the six ring roads that already encircle Beijing, the highway is to connect the new airport of Beijing which is currently under construction with the Beijing Capital International Airport.  This is a public-private partnership (PPP) project with a total investment of 12.18 billion yuan ($1.77 billion)."
0,"Improved political and business ties supported by factors like cultural events and new business models will boost long-term people-to-people exchanges and tourist flow between China and Austria, experts said. More than 973,000 Chinese tourists visited Austria in 2018, up 8 percent year-on-year, while more than 70,000 Austrians visitors came to China. That is the highest one-year tally since the two governments signed a tourism cooperation agreement in 2010, data from China Tourism Academy show. ""Austria has an excellent reputation in China as a cultural superpower and deservedly so,"" said Dai Bin, head of the Beijing-based academy. He said the signs were good for strong development. Dai said many Austrian orchestras have performed regularly in China. Artworks from both the past and present have been showcased in China and Austrian artists have held many successful exhibitions. Eager to grab more market share, China's Hainan Airlines began to operate a direct flight from Shenzhen to Vienna in October last year. A report released by Beijing Normal University in March forecasted that about 1 million Chinese tourists will visit Austria in 2019. According to the research, the majority of Chinese tourists heading overseas had medium to high incomes, with three-fourths each spending between 5,000 to 20,000 yuan ($745 to $2,980) on travel to Europe last year. Many tend to choose self-planned and customized vacations, as well as sport-related holidays. Zhang Yuxin, professor of business at Nankai University in Tianjin, said much of the growth in Austria's tourism was being driven by visitors from Asia. Asian visitors included tourists from China, South Korea and India. Thanks to their growing disposable incomes, demand has grown for in-depth travel, not only to major cities, but also to towns and the countryside. According to China Tourism Academy's findings, Vienna, Tyrol, Salzburg and Upper Austria became popular destinations for Chinese tourists in the country last year. About 56 percent of those tourists chose to stay in five- and four-star hotels. ""We also found that many Chinese tourists prefer to visit Austria, Germany and Switzerland together when making their travel plans because they are closer to each other and can share the air routes,"" Zhang said. ""The rapid advances in information technology in recent years give Chinese users instant access to real-time information on almost any topic,"" he added. Zhang said Austria has started to develop the peer-to-peer economy and new online payment approaches to cater to Chinese tourists."
1,"BEIJING - On Saturday, China and the United States issued a joint statement, vowing not to launch a trade war against each other. The international community welcomed this consensus reached by the world's two largest economies. Ning Yixi, professor of finance at the University of Houston-Victoria in the US state of Texas, said US enterprises will benefit from China's huge market, which will create more jobs for the United States. Meanwhile, products and services provided to the Chinese market will become better and more diversified, which will not only benefit customers, but be conducive to creating an environment for competition, said Ning. Ning also said that China's economic development has entered a new phase of transformation after 40 years of reform and opening-up, and some of China's industries and enterprises have been showing their competitiveness in the international market. At this moment, expanding imports from the United States as well as from other countries can help build a better business environment and promote the competitiveness of China's national industries, said Ning. Former president of the Chinese American Semiconductor Professional Association Lei Junzhao said China and the United States have reached an important consensus, and the joint statement is a good beginning as it will provide opportunities for the two countries to cooperate and will benefit enterprises and customers of both sides. Bloomberg said in an article published on Sunday that trade cooperation will be enhanced in such areas as energy, agriculture, health care, high-tech products and finance. The Wall Street Journal quoted Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, as saying in a Friday interview with White House reporters that Liu He, the Chinese vice-premier and head of the Chinese delegation, impressed Washington officials. The vice-premier is ""a smart guy, a market guy,"" Kudlow said. The agreement reached by China and the United States to abandon a trade war is not only in the interest of the two nations, but also of the whole world. Today, China's economic development has become fully integrated into the process of global economic development and the two are inseparable, said Dmitry Abzalov, head of the Russian Center for Strategic Communications. Swai Visavanant, senior researcher from Thailand at Chulalongkorn University's China Study Center, said he welcomed the joint statement on the China-US trade talks, which would likely create a favorable atmosphere in global trade."
0,"China will turn Beijing, Shanghai, and Hefei in East China's Anhui province into world-class science and innovation hubs in the future, an official with the Chinese Academy of Sciences said on Monday. In recent years, CAS has seen a rapid surge in major scientific output, and China has taken the front ranks of the world in certain key scientific fields, Bai Chunli, the president of the academy, in a recent interview with China Central Television. Such scientific achievements included the world's most powerful pulse laser, the world's first cloned monkey using somatic cells, the world's first 10,000-meter deep ocean seismic profile, and the world's deepest diving underwater glider, breaking the previous record of 6,000 meters by more than 300 meters. Many of the centers and top universities involved in these breakthroughs are located in Beijing and Shanghai, as well as in Hefei, where the University of Science and Technology of China and the state-lab for quantum information technology are located. ""The academy will fully support turning these three cities not only into national level science centers, but also world-class research hubs with Chinese characteristics,"" said Gao Hongjun, the director of the academy's Bureau of Frontier Science and Education. To strengthen China's momentum in scientific development, the bureau will continue to support frontier pilot projects to create original scientific breakthroughs, said Gao. At the same time, China will build more innovation research centers and state sponsored labs for cutting-edge science fields, and train more top talents to tackle major scientific challenges in the world, he added. The academy currently has 18 major pilot projects in advanced scientific fields, with five completed last year. They are quantum communication, brain science and intelligence technology, geology of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, superconducting electronics, and smog tracking mechanisms and technologies. China also has finished building 14 of its 19 planned innovation research centers, also known as Centers for Excellence, said Gao. They include fields such as particle physics, molecular science, brain science, quantum information science and other advanced science fields. These centers are world-class institutions in their respective fields, according to Nature Index, a research capability tracking database. ""These centers truly are pushing the envelope of science and are the energy source for China’s innovative and original science works,"" Gao said. Ding Hong, the chief scientist at the Beijing National Laboratory of Condensed Matter Physics, said the development of human civilization is based on our understanding of the material world. ""For the past decade, China has consistently supported basic scientific research,"" he said. ""It allows China to join the international science community and play a contributing role in answering some of the world's greatest mysteries.”"
1,"Jose Boisjoli, president and CEO of BRP, or Bombardier Recreational Products Inc, believes senior executives must have outstanding ability to manage their time well. The head of the Quebec, Canada-headquartered manufacturer of snowmobiles, watercraft and off-road vehicles, has a simple philosophy: hard work and a balanced approach are key to a successful life. Those three abilities - time management, hard work and a balanced approach - have helped Boisjoli to push three product lines into the China market, where a consumption upgrade and the run-up to the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics are proving to be timely advantages. Every time he visits China, he can't stop thinking about how many Chinese cities BRP's products have yet to reach. ""We see China as a big, big opportunity. We see it as a must-have and not a nice-to-have,"" he said during an early morning interview in Shanghai, after an overnight flight from Xi'an. An outdoor sports enthusiast, Boisjoli said China is no longer the distant outpost it once was for BRP. BRP is in talks with local partners in Chongqing municipality and the three autonomous regions of Guangxi Zhuang, Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang Uygur to further expand its dealership network in China. It also plans to introduce the product leasing business in China via tailor-made packages. Consumers can rent the products on certain days or a few weekends, instead of buying them. It's a business model that is fairly popular in North America and Europe. ""We will further expand sales channels, develop new products and sponsor well-known sport activities to enrich consumers' need for new lifestyles and holiday choices, so they can know more about our products,"" said Boisjoli, who is also a board member of McCain Foods Ltd, a Canadian food company that operates 54 plants across the world. The company supplied snowmobiles to the Organizing Committee of the Pyeongchang Olympic Winter Games in February and wants to cooperate with the Organizing Committee of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics and Paralympics to offer its products and expertise based on its requirement. The 2022 Games will be a major step forward in China's winter sports and ice and snow tourism sectors, said Boisjoli, who joined BRP almost 30 years ago. Under Boisjoli's leadership, BRP saw its revenue jump 8 percent last year to reach $4.5 billion. It currently has around 10,000 employees worldwide. BRP operates manufacturing facilities in Canada, the United States, Mexico, Finland, and Austria, which produce motorized recreational vehicles and power sports engines, the kind often seen in James Bond movies. BRP has a global sales network supported by 4,200 dealers and distributors, including 31 in China. Boisjoli said this figure will grow notably over the next five years. The company discovered that the market demand has been growing fast for personal watercraft, as well as Can-Am all-terrain vehicles in China. It will export its Can-Am Spyder three-wheel motorcycle products to China soon after receiving the necessary government approvals. As several ski resorts have opened in northern China over the past three years, more snowmobiles will be needed in those areas, Boisjoli said. ""We have constantly deployed our resources and manpower to develop different products for each season. This strategy is crucial to our dealers, so they can sell different products in different seasons to maintain a promising business. ""As the market competition is still fierce in China, what you need to succeed is reliable local partners, great products and to also ensure you have good after-sales service."" At present, BRP imports its products into China, but if China's market is further developed and generates encouraging sales figures, the company would consider setting up manufacturing or research facilities in the country, Boisjoli said. ""In overseas markets, especially in Europe and the US, people have the adventure tradition,"" said Xia Hong, a marketing professor at Beijing Technology and Business University. ""We found a growing number of consumers, especially middle-income earners and millennials in China, have adopted this (adventure-loving) lifestyle as they are willing to pay more to enlarge their experience in outdoor activities and they want better equipment,"" she said. The government is keen to build a healthier nation and eager to boost the outdoor sports sector through infrastructure and education. It has already announced it will build five national outdoor sports centers, 50 mountain trails with logistics facilities, 1,000 clubs for open-water sports including canoeing and sailing, and 2,000 aviation camps for sports such as paragliding and skydiving by 2020. So, high-end foreign powersports vehicles and propulsion systems, and related investment, will be consistent with the overall trend and benefit China's economy in the long run, Xia said."
0,"The story of how one man named a road after himself in Beijing has been widely circulated on the internet recently, the newspaper Beijing Youth Daily reported.  Some internet users said the man's move was funny, but others questioned whether the move violated relevant regulations. According to the article, Ge Yulu found an unnamed road and set up a homemade road sign declaring it Ge Yu Lu at both ends.  Born in 1990 in Wuhan, Hubei province, Ge is a postgraduate student in China Central Academy of Fine Arts since 2014. Part of his name, Lu, means road in Chinese. Ge's target was a short road between Baiziwan Road and Baiziwan South No 2 Road dividing a local community in Chaoyang district near the Fourth Ring Road of southeastern Beijing into northern and southern sections. It takes about 10 minutes to walk from one end to the other. Ge's homemade Ge Yu Lu signs have gradually convinced people the name is real. Ge Yu Lu first appeared as the road name in 2014 on Amap, China's leading provider of digital maps, navigation and location-based services. One year later, Baidu Maps also accepted the name.  A man who worked in the community for a long time said that the road existed when the community was established in 2007. In the beginning, the road had no name, but later, people called it Gu Yu Lu because of the road signs. He did not know when the road signs were set up.  A neighborhood committee worker said the road is registered as Baiziwan South No 1 Road. According to relevant regulations, only a special government office can name roads and places, a worker at the Beijing Municipal Commission of Urban Planning said. The worker said that while online maps have recorded the road name as Ge Yu Lu, it does not equal an official naming. Individuals are not allowed to make and set up road signs randomly, and the signs will be dismantled. Ge said he never expected the name to be recorded by mapping software. As Ge Yu Lu is now widely known, he is happy, but also a little worried that it does not comply with relevant regulations."
0,"Puppetry troupes from across China staged a performance in Beijing in 1955, and in the audience was the Czech artist Zdenek Sklenar, who passed away in 1986. He was enthralled by the show that centered around the Monkey King, the powerful protagonist from the 17th-century Chinese classic In the novel written by Wu Cheng'en, the Monkey King and his fellow disciples protect their master, Buddhist monk Xuanzang, on a hazardous undertaking to obtain sacred sutras. Decades since its publication, the mythological book, as well as its theater and folk adaptations, have accumulated a huge following. That April, after the puppet show, Sklenar had also watched a Peking Opera performance of the story. He drew several sketches as he enjoyed the show. Months later, Sklenar returned to Prague where he taught at the Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design. He developed the sketches he had made in China into a complete album, with 24 colorful and 80 ink illustrations, in 1961. At the time, Chinese people knew little about Sklenar's interpretation of Journey to the West.,Now, 14 pieces from this Monkey King series are on display at an ongoing exhibition at Prince Kung's Palace in Beijing. The exhibition is dedicated to Sklenar's drawings and lithographs from the 1930s to the '80s, and the exhibits are from the collection of the Zdenek Sklenar Gallery in Prague. Sklenar's art made its China debut in 2009, when a retrospective exhibition was held at the National Art Museum of China, where the Monkey King illustrations were also shown. They were also part of the Czech national pavilion during the 2010 Shanghai Expo. The Chinese audience, which is familiar with the figures and scenarios of Journey to the West, has found Sklenar's graffiti-style presentation of the story appealing. Fan Di'an, who heads the Central Academy of Fine Arts, says the late artist's production embodies ""a strong modern touch"" by incorporating his impressions of Chinese culture with European visual traditions in a ""smart and innovative"" way. Fan had curated Sklenar's debut China exhibition.,One of the Monkey King's magical powers, as described in the novel, is his ability to transform into 72 creatures and objects. Sklenar's series has been hailed in China as the ""73rd transformation of the Monkey King"". But the Monkey King was not the only gain for Sklenar during his three-month stay in China in 1955. As a member of a visiting delegation from former Czechoslovakia, Sklenar participated in an expo showing the achievements of socialist society in Beijing and Shanghai. He also seized the opportunity to explore the country's artistic and cultural heritage, something he had wanted to do even as a student. In his memoir, Sklenar wrote that his professor, Karel Sourek, had ignited his interest in Chinese culture and suggested that he buy two books on Chinese art history, which cost him the bulk of his monthly living expenses back then. And while the books hit Sklenar's wallet, he wrote, they gave him much pleasure throughout his life.,He kept a diary recording his travels in China, put together with many sketches of the landscapes he saw. These texts and drawings inspired his creation of lithographs themed on China in the late 1950s, and some from this series of prints are also on show at the ongoing Beijing exhibition. Lucie Olivova, an associate professor of Chinese studies at Masaryk University in the Czech Republic, says the artist beautifully drew Beihai Park, his most-visited place in Beijing, and the streets with antiques stores in neighborhoods such as Liulichang and Longfusi. Olivova has studied Sklenar's diary. Sklenar drew whatever he found interesting, such as the decorative patterns on palace pillars, window frames and lamps when visiting the Forbidden City-he went there at least three times-as well as the shapes of rice fields he saw from flights and the napkins folded like blossoms in glass cups when he ate at restaurants. Olivova says Sklenar studied Chinese pictorial elements for years, and was an early artist in Czechoslovakia to present Chinese imagery in oil paintings.,Sklenar deepened his understanding of Chinese culture by meeting literary figures in China, such as eminent painters Li Keran, Wu Zuoren, Ye Qianyu and Hua Junwu, and author and historian Guo Moruo, with whom he discussed the inscriptions of Chinese characters on ancient bronze ware. Sklenar enriched his own collection by buying antique pieces, Buddhist statues and paintings by Li and Qi Baishi, a master of classic Chinese art who was 92 at the time of Sklenar's visit. Qi held a red walking stick, wore clothes in the colors of grapes and a black hat, and had a mole under his left eye, Sklenar later wrote of his encounter with the Chinese painter. Sklenar also visited prominent painter Lin Fengmian's studio in Shanghai and purchased three paintings on behalf of the National Gallery in Prague. The fragmented sentences and drawings in Sklenar's diary allow people today to picture a passing world that is extraordinary, Olivova says, and his Chinese series glitters in the context of modern Czech art. ""I've fulfilled the dream,"" Sklenar once said about his China trip. 8 am-5 pm, daily, through Sunday. Anshan Hall, Prince Kung's Palace, 17 Qianhai Xijie, Xicheng district. Beijing. 010-8328-8149."
1,"Self-service stores in China's major cities have become a growing trend as online technology extends opening hours.  The country's leading home-appliance retailer, Suning Commerce Group Co Ltd, recently rolled out its third self-service outlet - this time in Beijing.  There are now Suning Biu stores in Nanjing and Shanghai, selling more than 550 different products, including sportswear, groceries and high-tech gadgets.  Facial recognition technology allows consumers to enter and leave the stores, while goods are scanned and then paid for via its applications.  This self-service format is catching on and expanding from corner shops to restaurants and even to gyms.  Of course, the transformation taking place in convenience stores has reduced labor costs and brought in round-the-clock opening hours for customers.  Crucial to making this work is the sort of facial recognition technology developed by Xiao Maipu Technology Development Co Ltd, short for Xiaomai and Face++.  Aplus Capital and Chenshan Capital have invested 125 million yuan ($18.5 million) in the Beijing-based Xiaomai. The company plans to use the funding to build up its supply chain and upgrade its products and system.  ""Staff-less stores can reduce the high costs that often keep traditional convenience stores from fast expansion and healthy revenue growth,"" said Quan Bin, deputy general manager at Xiaomai.  Most of these outlets are only 20 square meters, the size of a tiny room, and they usually sell about 600 different kinds of products.  They are all automated with just one member of staff packing shelves. In-store cameras keep an eye on shoppers, while big data analysis highlights what products are hot and what are not among customers.  ""The rate of shop lifting in staffless convenience store is about three people out of every 1,000 shoppers,"" Quan said.  Indeed, this model is being rolled out in other sectors.  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd launched Tao Cafe, a cashier-free retail store, on July 8. It uses facial and voice recognition systems.  BingoBox is another major player in the grocery industry. The Guangdong startup has ambitious plans to open 5,000 automated outlets across China in the next 12 months after receiving 100 million yuan in first round funding.  Still, at the heart of retailing, whether it is online or offline, is selecting, positioning and managing the merchandizing.  ""Online has higher efficiency while offline offers greater experience,"" said Quan.  But the rapid growth of the self-service sector has created problems leading to calls for new regulations.  The China Chain Store & Franchise Association has released a guide to self-service operations. It includes how the sector should be regulated, and covers management models, merchandize safety, food safety and post-service.  ""Without industry regulations, self-service stores could be risky for consumers,"" said Yu Jieqi, a retail consultant.  Wang Hongtao, deputy secretary general of the China Chain Store & Franchise Association, felt self-service stores had great potential.  But while improvements need to be made in the cost-sharing process and even in technology, it will be the products that define success or failure.  ""Telling a story will not help self-service stores grow,"" Wang said. ""It will be about meeting the diversified needs and demands of customers."""

0,"BEIJING -- The mayor of Beijing said Monday that more efforts would be made to green the city in the new year, including creating more parks, planting more trees and expanding greenbelt areas downtown. The annual government work report, delivered by Chen Jining at the opening meeting of the annual session of the Beijing Municipal People's Congress, said 1,600 hectares of land would be vacated for greening purposes in 2019. The city has planned to add 16,667 hectares of forest this year, in addition to the 17,933 hectares completed in 2018, according to the report. A total of 1,683 hectares of land were vacated for greening in the last year, Chen said. Another 28 city leisure parks and 121 mini parks were added, bringing the coverage of parks within a radius of 500 meters to 80 percent citywide. An area of 66.7 hectares of the ""green core"" of the city, located in Tongzhou District, has been greened in the past year, together with the creation of several other wetland parks in and around the city, Chen said. Suburban districts including Yanqing, Huairou and Miyun will step up applications to be national-level forest cities through the establishment of a green development fund and green bonds to attract social capital, the report said."
0,"BEIJING -- Beijing Municipal Commission of Commerce said Sunday that new technology such as big data and cloud computing will be applied to ensure food safety in Beijing. The commission said the city is exploring and working with enterprises to set up a food traceability system, so that all stages in the food supply chain can be tracked. The system will cover food production, processing, packaging, delivery and sales. The commission has signed a strategic agreement with Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com to carry out cooperation in food traceability. Some departments have also worked with influential time-honored brands to establish a food traceability system. As of the end of 2017, Beijing's pork and vegetable supply chains had 1,778 and 2,383 traceability points, respectively. The figures will increase to 1,900 and 2,600 in 2018."
0,"Leaders of the Shanghai municipal government have joined the bike-sharing craze sweeping China.  Headed by the Party chief of Shanghai Han Zheng, the group rode shared bikes along the Huangpu River to experience the newly-opened area alongside residents on Wednesday. Locals posted pictures online and their bike choices became a hot topic on WeChat. The leaders did not favor one bike-share brand though, forming a rainbow of colors with some on Mobikes, Ofos, and even a Phoenix bike made in Shanghai. A social media user wrote: ""Don't fight, comrades! They ride all of them! People are satisfied, let's be happy!"" During the annual session of China's top legislature this year, many members of the Shanghai delegation rode shared bikes in Beijing. Han said then: ""I support shared bikes! I appreciate such an innovative initiative. The government should embrace the new creation."" His public riding is a powerful footnote to this statement. Shared bikes have become very popular across China in less than half a year, becoming one of the most effective business measures to solve the ""the last mile"" problem of city traffic.  As shared bikes become increasingly popular in many cities, they have exposed a slew of problems like illegal parking, encroachment on public resources and poor pedestrian behavior.  Cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Tianjin have rolled out regulatory measures, giving active support and regulating the bike-sharing industry. The introduction of these policies sets standards and constraints, while also demonstrating support for the industry. The policies reflect the Party and government's wish to actively develop the sharing economy and promote innovation in entrepreneurship.  China's bike-sharing industry has become a new model leading the trend of the world."
0,"Short trips to admire the beauty of spring flowers were popular among Chinese during the Tomb Sweeping Day holiday, which lasted from Sunday to Tuesday, according to travel agencies. A report released on Tuesday by leading online travel agency Ctrip showed that people were keen to take short trips around their home cities to enjoy spring blossoms during the three-day holiday. In cities like Beijing and Chongqing, short trip packages to suburban areas or city outskirts with blossom-viewing opportunities were among the best-selling, the report said. Apart from seasonal flowers like cole flowers and sakura, peach flowers also attracted lots of attention, thanks to  a TV serial romance that has gone viral recently among young people. Ctrip's finding was echoed in a report by online travel agency lvmama.com, which found that people were passionate about spring outings during the holiday, due to the sunny and warm days. Bookings of short trips on Lvmama tripled that from the same period last year. The report also found that apart from some traditionally hot tourism destinations, like Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, other major cities, including Nanjing and Suzhou of Jiangsu province, Hangzhou of Zhejiang province and Wuhan of Hubei province, also attracted large numbers of tourists during the holiday."

The facial recognition technology, which would also strengthen security checks, is likely to be put into test runs this year, according to the report. This comes on the heels of a QR code payment system across the entire Beijing Subway system. This now allows riders to scan a QR code through an app. Scanning a QR code is said to be especially convenient at the stations near the Beijing Train Station, where the passengers sometimes have to queue for 30 minutes to buy a one-way ticket on the vending machines."
0,"Deputy prime minister of Ireland visits the Beijing University of Technology On Saturday, the hallways of the Beijing Dublin International College at Beijing University of Technology turned green as boards decorated with green ribbons were hung up on the walls. Photos on the boards showed hundreds of happy students clad in green T-shirts or hats, holding up the national flag of China alongside banners wishing people a ""Happy St Patrick's Day"". St Patrick's Day on March 17 is a day of recognition for people in Ireland and also a big day for the teachers and students at the BDIC. Every year, the entire school follows Irish tradition and dresses up in green before hosting a parade and staging performances with international students from the BJUT. This year was no exception. The staff and students enjoyed a series of activities under the theme of ""Light Up the Green in Our Life"". Most impressive of all for this year's Feast of Saint Patrick was a visit to the college by Simon Coveney, the deputy prime minister of Ireland. The vice-premier's visit on Saturday happily coincided with Beijing's long-awaited first snowfall this year. It also marked the first time that an Irish deputy prime minister had visited Beijing Dublin International College, a joint-venture school established in 2012 by Ireland's University College Dublin and the Beijing University of Technology. ""I'm really impressed by the quality of English that so many Chinese students are clearly able to speak,"" Coveney said after visiting the college. At the official meeting between the delegation from Ireland and faculties from Beijing, Coveney expressed his desire to further develop cooperation between institutions and universities of both nations, as well as China and Ireland as a whole, and to cultivate a new generation of experts in the fields of technology and engineering. During the meeting, he received a special gift from Xie Hui, the Party secretary of the Beijing University of Technology. The gift was a hammer, to represent the ""spirit of craftsmanship"" of the BJUT's students. Once enrolled into the university, every freshman is required to take a class of metalworking practice, in which they learn how to forge their own hammers. Within the past week, Hainan Airlines and Cathay Pacific announced plans to open direct flights from Beijing to Dublin and from Hong Kong to Dublin respectively, which Coveney sees as a stimulus for further exchanges between the two countries. He also joked that there was no longer any excuse for Chinese students not to travel and study in Ireland, or vice versa.,Li Xiaolin, a junior student majoring in internet of things engineering at the college, listened to the deputy prime minister's morning lecture on the role Ireland plays on the global stage and the depth of Sino-Irish ties. ""I'm encouraged by his words and eager to explore the beautiful country on my own,"" said Li, who will in her final year study at University College Dublin. She also attended an open day at the embassy of Ireland later that day, and even took a selfie with the Irish deputy prime minister. ""I've benefited a great deal from the opportunity to immerse myself in a foreign culture that the college offers me,"" said Li, adding that her IELTS score had been lifted from 5.5 to 6.5 after two years of study at the college's all-English classes. Li is now preparing to apply to her dream university of Imperial College London for her postgraduate studies. Over 90 percent of the 194 graduates last year from the BDIC went to study in foreign universities for postgraduate programs, says Liu Gonghui, president of the BJUT. Liu says the college aims to offer domestic students a world-class international education by hiring qualified faculty members from both University College Dublin and the Beijing University of Technology, bringing a multicultural perspective to its curriculum and embracing an open-minded atmosphere. ""Our long-term goal is to build BJUT into a first-class international university through the strategy of internationalization, and the BDIC is a pioneer in the cause,"" said Liu.

Somphone Khongsab, from the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment of Laos, shared their work in raising public awareness of greenhouse gas emissions, and the research they have done about Laos climate change policies. Khongsab said that they are looking to start more cooperation with relevant institutions and groups to tackle climate change. Climate change has also affected Myanmar by causing extreme weather and more floods and droughts in the area, said Kyaw San Naing, director of the Environmental Conservation Department, Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation of Myanmar. She also noted that the Myanmar government has rolled out a national strategy and action plan designed to realize sustainable development. After the seminar, representatives visited the Beijing Planning Exhibition Hall where they saw the history of Beijing's urban planning and the city's philosophy of advancing environmentally friendly practices. The 2019 ASEAN-China Environmental Cooperation Week started March 25 and has five seminars on national ASEAN-China cooperation, including topics such as focal points for environmental cooperation, eco-friendly cities, operational and technical issues in environmental information sharing, and climate change policies and actions."

The air pollution will persist until Thursday. The central part of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region is forecast to see moderate to severe air pollution during the period, said a source with the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Ecology and Environment. The yellow alert is issued when the air quality index surpasses 200 or the average density of PM2.5 stays above 150 micrograms per cubic meter for two consecutive days. Under Beijing's current three-tier warning system, the yellow alert is the least severe, followed by orange and red. The yellow alert and above will trigger a series of compulsory emergency responses including the suspension of outdoor construction operations to reduce dust, the restriction of heavy pollution vehicles or the suspension of production in smokestack industries."

Under the agreement, an international academic program will be launched with funding of $1 million from the Chinese government to scholars under 35 years of age from around the world. Hosted by the Ministry of Education and UNESCO, the session - entitled ""Safeguarding the Diversity of Asian Civilizations"" - focused on cultural interactions among Asian people and discussed challenges in terms of revitalizing the multiple cultures of Asian countries and regions. Lee Byong-hyun, chairman of the executive board of UNESCO, said at the session's opening ceremony that multilateral cooperation is crucial in tackling local, regional and global issues. ""My experience has taught me that the key for the success of international cooperation is dialogue,"" he said. ""This requires being curious about others, willing to open up and ready to listen with real engagement."" Chen Baosheng, minister of education, said civilizations are enriched by exchanges, in which people learn from each other. ""To promote the world's peaceful development, we need to see more and think more in light of protecting diverse Asian civilizations. It's encouraging to hold a more inclusive and modest attitude about equal dialogue among Asian civilizations. ""We need to keep the principle of amity, sincerity, mutual benefits and inclusiveness in mind to make the dialogue among Asian civilizations an inspiration to the world and to future human development. It's also important to fully use education to help people learn more about the values of different civilizations and to pass down the cultures,"" he said. At the session, 44 scholars and professors from Asian countries, along with France, Russia, Germany and Canada, voiced their opinions on exchanges by Asian civilizations in historical and modern times. Chen Lai, a professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing, said some ancient Chinese philosophers had proposed values for different civilizations. ""Confucius said that 'A gentleman seeks harmony, not conformity', showing respect to different cultures,"" he said. ""Mencius proposed that we should have good intentions toward others. I think it's an inclusive attitude toward other people and their civilizations."" He said that it's of great importance to promote such philosophies to enhance the exchanges and mutual learning of diverse civilizations. Frederick W. Russell-Rivoallan, a program specialist and head of social and human sciences for UNESCO, hailed the dialogue of Asian civilizations. ""It's a great way to concentrate in this part of world, but it's also a global inspiration - bringing countries together, understanding other cultures, respecting each other and sharing with each other,"" he said. ""That's the way that we can understand each other better and live together better."""
0,"Beijing will never tolerate any separatist schemes or activities related to ""Taiwan independence"", Premier Li Keqiang warned on Monday in Beijing. He made the remark when delivering the Government Work Report at the opening meeting of the first session of the 13th National People's Congress, the top legislature. ""We will remain firm in safeguarding China's sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" Li said. In upholding the one-China policy, the mainland will continue to promote peaceful development of cross-Straits relations on the basis of the 1992 Consensus, which embodies the one-China policy and advances China's peaceful reunification, he said. Li promised that the mainland will expand cross-Straits economic and cultural exchanges and cooperation, and ensure that over time people from Taiwan come to enjoy the same treatment as mainland residents when they pursue studies, do business, work or live on the mainland. ""As fellow Chinese living on both sides of the Taiwan Straits, we share a bond of kinship,"" he said. ""As long as we go with the tide of history and work together for our nation's greater good, we will together create the future-a beautiful future of national rejuvenation."" Zhang Zhijun, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, said by upholding the one-China policy, Beijing will continue to promote peaceful development and advance China's peaceful reunification. ""However, if some people insist on supporting 'Taiwan independence' and destroying our homes and lands, the Chinese people, including Taiwan compatriots, won't accept it. The Chinese nation won't accept it. What they (separatists) do is futile,"" he said. ""We have firm resolve and are full of confidence that we have sufficient capability to stop any scheme or activity related to 'Taiwan independence'."" Zhang said tension between the mainland and Taiwan has been caused by the Taiwan authority's failure to recognize the 1992 Consensus. To further promote exchanges and cooperation with the island, the office introduced 31 measures that allow Taiwan residents to share in the opportunities brought about by the mainland's development. The measures cover industry, finance and taxation, land use, employment, education, culture and healthcare. They include 12 that relate to equal treatment for Taiwan enterprises. Financial institutions in Taiwan can cooperate with mainland counterparts to provide small payment and credit services for Taiwan residents, according to the measures. The measures can help Taiwan businesses reduce their manufacturing and operating costs, speed up transformation and upgrade and expand in the mainland market. There are also 19 measures offering Taiwan people equal treatment with mainland residents in areas including education, establishing businesses, and working on the mainland. Limits on films and television programs, including annual quotas on TV content or the number of movies airing in cinemas, will also be eliminated."
1,"Several ministry-level departments, including those for ecology and environment, education, and agriculture and rural affairs, have responded recently to issues of public concern. The environmental watchdog said on Friday that it will adopt a variety of measures to fight against pollution and protect the ecology and environment of the Bohai Sea area. Ke Chang, a senior official from the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, said the campaign against pollution will be conducted on four fronts; namely, addressing pollution sources on land, curbing pollution from maritime activities, restoring the maritime ecological environment and preventing environmental risks. The campaign will target rivers and outfalls flowing into the Bohai Sea, factories, pollution from rural residents and agriculture, and urban sewage. Pollution from mariculture, vessels and ports will also be targeted, he told a news conference. The government will adopt rigorous rules to control sea reclamation and coastline development projects. It will carry out environmental risks assessments and law enforcement inspections to wipe out major risks to the maritime environment. The government will also establish an early warning and emergency response system against red and green tides. The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs has called for greater coordination between Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei province to control and prevent the spread of African swine fever. Yu Kangzhen, vice-minister of agriculture and rural affairs, said at a work conference on Nov 27 that the risks for the spread of the fever cannot be ignored as the country is still faced with a challenging situation of disease control. Authorities from Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei should unify their leadership over disease control and prevention and increase information connectivity and coordination in measures, he said. He also called for better emergency responses to improve prevention and joint efforts from the three provincial areas for law enforcement. The Agriculture Ministry said last month that it has confirmed African swine fever on two farms in Beijing, the first cases in the Chinese capital. The disease was detected on two farms in the municipality's Fangshan district. The Ministry of Education said on Nov 28 that it will increase the percentage of public kindergartens among preschool institutions so that more children can enjoy inclusive preschool education services. Lyu Yugang, an official with the department of elementary education with the ministry, said in a news conference on Nov 28 that authorities will inspect unlicensed kindergartens, certify those that are qualified and suspend or close those that fail to meet safety or hygiene standards. Those found with ""excessive profit-seeking behaviors"" in establishing or operating kindergartens will be strictly curbed, he said. Public kindergartens took up 44.1 percent of the country's total kindergartens in 2017, according to the ministry. An online trademark service system has been launched as part of efforts to better protect intellectual property rights, the National Intellectual Property Administration announced on Nov 27. The online system, which is upgraded from the trademark application system, will integrate one-stop services including trademark inquiry, application, announcements, online payment and registration publicity, according to the administration. Shen Changyu, head of the administration, said the launch of the online system is an important step to facilitate trademark registration and to build a trademark service system with high efficiency and transparency. He noted that the registration and review of intellectual property rights are key parts of IPR protection, and the authority will continue to improve the mechanism and its services. Efforts have also been made to fast-track the trademark registration process, and the average trademark review cycle had shortened to less than six months as of November. The country has seen a growing number of applications for trademark in recent years. Trademark applications in China reached around 6 million from January to October, up by 36.4 percent year-on-year, according to the authority."
1,"BEIJING — This is the fourth year express delivery employee Zhao Yunhong has spent the Spring Festival holiday working in Beijing. Though Zhao's home is only three hours drive from Beijing, in Chengde City of neighboring Hebei Province, he feels that he is more needed at his job at the logistic arm of JD.com, a Chinese e-commerce giant. His wife and two children are joining him to celebrate the Spring Festival, or Chinese Lunar New Year, in his rented apartment in the capital. Express delivery services are essential for the generation of young Chinese who grew up embracing online shopping. They click, order and have their purchases delivered to their doorstep. Having worked here for several years, he has a personal bond with his customers in the Senlindadi neighborhood in northern Beijing. ""Some of my clients, I got to know them when I brought wedding supplies to their apartments. Now I bring diapers to their new born babies,"" he said. ""I miss my hometown, the feeling of the Lunar New Year there, but working hard and the feeling of being needed is also important for me."" As Chinese people embrace online shopping, the industry has boomed. Chinese express delivery firms handled a record number of 50.71 billion parcels in 2018, up 26.6 percent from the same period of the previous year. Business revenue expanded by 21.8 percent to reach 603.84 billion yuan (about 88.7 billion U.S. dollars). China has roughly over 3 million express delivery staff. Though most deliveries are suspended during the seven-day public holiday for the Lunar New Year, some employees remain on duty. JD.com logistics say about half of the employees at a number of key stations in Beijing are on duty during the holiday. The company pays them extra bonuses. Courier boys are paid by the amount of deliveries they make. Some can earn as much as 300 yuan (44 dollars) a day, and the company pays them double the daily salary for working during the holiday. Zhou Xiaolei, a 28-year-old from Yunnan Province in southwest China, works for SF Express, another private express operator. This is his fourth year working in the job. He also made a decision to stay in Beijing for the holiday time. He is saving up for an apartment in his hometown and the handsome bonuses are hard to refuse. ""I will work for another few years, and I want to settle down at my hometown and build a home with my wife,"" he said. About 20 people work at a delivery station near Tsinghua University in Beijing. They serve about 80,000 people, most of whom are students. During the holiday season, their clients are residents who shop for groceries and gifts. The delivery staff bring convenience and a gift of time to the clients, particularly busy families and the elderly. They are considered an asset of a city. Liu Chang, a retiree who lives alone in southern Beijing, is glad to find out that she can order groceries even on the first day of the Lunar New Year, when some supermarkets are closed. She suffers from chronic pain in her leg, so grocery shopping is a challenge. ""Honestly, I cannot imagine my life without the delivery service,"" she said."
0,"Luxury Sanlitun hotel plays it elegant in era of fickle fashion hotels, Li You reports. Fashion is a fickle business with the hottest trends coming and going as quickly as the tide that sweeps in and out at the shore. But when fashion is your business, having a central, enduring and classic philosophy is what separates the leaders from the pretenders. InterContinental Hotels & Resorts, whose flagship Beijing hotel is located in affluent Sanlitun, has been a fashion classic for more than 70 years. Francois Vanvi, the owner representative of InterContinental Beijing Sanlitun, is proud to say he doesn't follow the ebbs and flows of fashion, but instead has a tireless focus on providing ""classic, elegant and comfortable"" products for the hotel's many discerning guests. One of the first signs that this hotel is a leader not a follower is in the sheer size of its guest rooms, starting at an impressively comfortable 45 square meters. All rooms are equipped with cozy furniture to relax upon, spotlessly clean bath tubs, shinning faucets and fresh flowers - as well as captivating views of Beijing's trendy downtown Sanlitun area. Francois says that though the latest technology plays a role in any hotel, it is not the be-all and end-all. While having gentle nods and winks to technology here and there, the rooms at InterContinental Beijing Sanlitun have a ""back to basics"" feel at their heart. ""High-tech is not a fit for everybody,"" Francois says. ""Fashionable and elegant things should make people feel comfortable, relaxed and with amenities friendly to use."",But focusing on these basics doesn't mean that the hotel is in any way out-of-date in its style. When high-end devices are really needed, the hotel is up their with the innovative best, which can be seen in its separate business area in its rooms that are equipped with a high-quality audio systems, interactive TVs, high-speed Wi-Fi and internet access. Apart from a bed to lay the head, weary travelers can also treat their rumbling stomachs at the hotel's veritable treasure trove of authentic restaurants. Conjuring the gamut of the Orient's finest cuisine, the Ying restaurant serves up a banquet of Chinese classics and traditional flavors from its Michelin menu. A particular specialty of the kitchen is its drunken chicken roll made with Shanghai yellow rice wine. Diners with an appetite for fresh seafood mustn't miss the chilled abalone, jellyfish and asparagus. Other classics on the menu include Sichuan crispy beef, Liuting-style pork trotter and deep fried turnip puff pastries - all cooked in a traditional style that originates from ordinary Chinese kitchens. Guests with a Spanish flair should dine at Top Tapas - a living room-style lounge space with a lively atmosphere. A fabulous selection of hot and cold, savory and sweet plates can be enjoyed. Particular favorite is the seafood paella with prawns, mussels, scallops and chorizo. Char restaurant serves a wide selection of juicy steaks exported from all over the world, such as Blackmore, Jack's Creek and Gape Grim. To keep their original flavor, the steaks are served with a gently sprinkle of sea salt. Another aspect of the hospitality business that never goes out of fashion is service, and InterContinental Beijing Sanlitun has the philosophy of keeping things ""just right"". Hotel staff members greet customers warmly and make them feel at home, but are not so overwhelming as to not leave guests their own space, Francois says. InterContinental Beijing Sanlitun in Chaoyang district only opened in 2016, but has already upheld the esteemed reputation of its brand. The building's design draws inspiration from a hexagonal diamond, shaped by continuous refining of the raw gemstone. The hotel uses the essential element throughout, from the metallic brass grille outside the building and the shape of doorplates to the figured pattern on the menus. Francois says the hotel is also equipped with meeting and conference services, an 800-square-meter ballroom and eight function rooms with a total area of more than 1,500 sq m. Apart for the guest room services, many customers come to the hotel for meetings, conferences, banquets, special events and wedding. ""We are not just an ordinary hotel, from design, uniform, staffing, culture and our values,"" Francois says. ""We believe less is more and authenticity will always be in fashion."""

It is also the place, where Sui Yiyang, a young   maker, produces the traditional Chinese music instrument. Sui, who hails from Chengde, Hebei came to Beijing in 2007 to study how to play the instrument. But by the end of 2008, he began to be interested in making it.,At first, Sui, who had his own business, regarded his interest in the instrument as a hobby. But as he fell more deeply in love with it, he decided to become a full-time   maker. As he began to study the subject more deeply, he discovered the traditional way of making the   and how it is done today. For Sui, who follows the traditional route, it takes around 20 months to transform a batch of wood into an instrument. All materials are carefully sourced, and the production process is in accordance with the highest standards of the Tang Dynasty (618-907).,Sui has produced only four instruments in the past two and a half years. But this is because he relies only on his hands to produce the instruments. Sui, who is in his early 30s, has delivered two ""  appreciation"" lectures at the Poly Museum and the National Museum, respectively, and won acclaim for his presentations. His instruments are keenly sought by collectors at home and abroad."

During the past 30 years, although many time-honored brands are continuing to develop, some are fading away. There is a wave of regret at the thought of the time-honored food brands such as Puwufang, Baohuachun and Tianyishun that have vanished. The old generation of revolutionary leaders showed loving care for the time-honored brands. Mao Zedong had a few instructions on time-honored brands, including Wangmazi, Zhang Koizumi, Donglaishun, Quanjude, Ruifuxiang, Tongrentang, Business Printing House, Zhonghua Book Company and Fire Palace stinky tofu. ""Wangmazi, Donglaishun and Quanjude will be preserved forever,"" said Mao Zedong. ""Ruifuxiang and Tongrentang will also save a thousand years…To save the name of history, why not the name of Business Printing House and Zhonghua Book Company."" Most of these time-honored brands Mao referred to are Beijing-based time-honored brands, which have an important position in his life. Mao often frequented Changsha Fire Palace to eat stinky tofu when he was young and went there again after the liberation, leaving saying ""Fire Palace stinky tofu is still delicious"". Then, Changsha Fire Palace used the leader's words to advertise and protect the time-honored brand. It is said that Mao used the ""Zhang Koizumi"" scissors. Zhou Enlai gave instructions to the Shengxifu hat shop ""to keep the characteristic of Shengxifu and organize to run factories"". He liked the ""Wonton hou"" ravioli and specifically invited chefs of ""Wonton hou"" to cook for foreign guests. He lined up in the China photography studio in Beijing Wangfujing Street. Besides, Zhou had creatively explained the word ""Quanjude"". Deng Xiaoping loves to wear the shoes made by Neiliansheng shoe store and had shoes measured there several times. ""The shoes are appropriate, my thanks to the masters of Neiliansheng shoe store,"" Deng said in a message to Neiliansheng one time after his shoes were finished. He gave high praise to this time-honored brand in his words. Xiaoping's family had made a pair of shoes for him in Neiliansheng, hoping he could set foot in Hong Kong after its return to the mainland. Unfortunately, these shoes did not last. This pair of shoes was later officially collected by the National Museum with ""Xiaoping shoes"" named by Neiliansheng. ""This is not Shengxifu and do refrain from labeling others,"" Deng Xiaoping said in a sarcastic and humorous comment in response to a hat factory operated by the Gang of Four during the period of the ""cultural revolution""(1966-76). Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai and Deng Xiaoping are all great leaders, who live their daily lives as ordinary people and share the same love and appreciation for time-honored brands.

0,"President Xi Jinping urged organizers on Monday to host an extraordinary Winter Olympics in 2022 through rational planning and economic use of resources.  Xi made the remarks during his visit to Zhangjiakou, Hebei province, Beijing's co-host city for the 2022 Games, to listen to a briefing on preparatory work and inspect proposed venue areas around Chongli county.  The president stressed that the organizing committee and involved departments should approach the preparation based on scientific planning in venue design, construction and resource allocation to host a green, open-minded and corruption-free Olympics in a shared manner.  ""There should be clear positioning of this region for future development. Rather than developing into a large-scale comprehensive metropolitan area, Chongli should be built into a ski destination with a strong local character,"" Xi said.  ""The post-Olympics operation of the facilities should be considered beforehand, given that many Olympic host cities face challenges with venues left unused after the event,"" he added.  Beijing, host of the 2008 Summer Olympics, and Zhangjiakou were picked in 2015 to host the 2022 Winter Olympics. Beijing will be the first city to hold both Summer and Winter Games.  During his visit to Genting Ski Resort in Chongli, the proposed venue for snowboarding and freestyle skiing in 2022, Xi received a warm ovation from regular skiers and athletes of China's national freestyle skiing team, who are training at the resort.  Public participation in and the athletic level of winter sports in China remain relatively low, but the 2022 Games will provide the perfect opportunity to boost the sector within five years, Xi said.  Xi also visited the resort's equipment rental area before going outdoors to check venue layouts around the resort.  China is rolling out a national plan inspired by Xi to encourage 300 million people to participate in winter sports and related activities by 2022. Governmental support for developing winter sports has earned positive comments from Thomas Bach, president of the International Olympic Committee. Bach said that after meeting Xi in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Jan 18, he feels certain China will be a success in hosting the Games.  ""It's obvious that the central government has high expectations in promoting winter sports ... as a new driver for economic growth, while encouraging the public to participate more in sports in general for a healthier nation,"" said Lin Xianpeng, a sports industry researcher from Beijing Sport University."
0,"When we were asked what special education was in our first class at a normal university, 40 of us gave more than 20 answers, said Zhao Changhong, now a teacher at a special school in Beijing's Xicheng district. Zhao, 44, had no idea what kind of students she would face when she was allocated to the special education class of a normal university in Beijing's Fengtai district in 1991. ""Careers like teacher, doctor and accountant were steady for graduates in our generation,"" she said. ""That was my only concern for choosing a major."" However, the first internship in their freshman year doused the enthusiasm of Zhao and her classmates. As they arrived at a newly built special education school in Beijing, the future teachers, full of enthusiasm, were greeted by a hail of small pebbles dropped by a group of mentally disabled teenagers. ""Later that day, we fell silent in our dormitory; some even missed dinner,"" Zhao said, recalling her frustration at the first sight of her special students. That early, unpleasant experience left Zhao reluctant to meet students ahead of her second internship, in her sophomore year, but her attitude changed the moment she saw an ardent student clumsily helping a teacher lift chairs during a class she was observing. She was touched by the role of special education and discovered a sense of mission to make a difference for mentally disabled children. As a result, she was one of approximately 30 classmates who opted to become special education teachers after graduation in 1994. According to a report released by the Ministry of Education in 2015, there were 48,125 special education teachers in China by the end of 2014, making the teacher-student ratio in special education 1: 3.86, compared with 1: 4.19 five years earlier. Zhao has now taught in special schools for 24 years, encountering a number of impressive students, as well as parents, along the way. Parents have complicated feelings for their mentally disabled children, Zhao said. They hide their anxiety elsewhere, but, lacking another channel to vent negative emotions, reveal their inner feelings to teachers, or question them. Zhao said she regarded parents' encouragement of teachers as more valuable than affirmation from schools, and it was a child's progress that would dispel parental doubts. ""I will never forget what a mother said to me, 'Having you in my son's life is the best fortune for him',"" Zhao said, choking back tears. As society has gradually become more understanding about children with mental disabilities, communication with parents has become easier. Support from governments and social groups has also increased, with the Ministry of Education report saying total funding for special schools hit 9.59 billion yuan ($1.38 billion) in 2014. In special investment programs in 2008 and 2012, the central government poured a total of 10.2 billion yuan into building and renovating 1,182 special education schools, 62 higher vocational colleges for the disabled and normal universities for special education, along with improving infrastructure and purchasing rehabilitation equipment for special education. By the end of 2014, there were 2,000 special schools in the compulsory education system. The report said there were about 395,000 students studying at special schools in 2014. Special curricula and textbooks have also been set for mentally disabled students, even though they are not universally applicable. ""As we cannot find two leaves exactly the same in the world, the situation of each student with autism varies,"" Zhao said. ""More than 20 types of methods have been summarized to educate mentally impaired students, but we still need to learn from practice when it comes to autistic children."""
1,"Legal experts are calling for new legislation to enhance privacy protections as soon as possible to better deal with spam and unsolicited text messages as well as identity fraud. Although telecom and technology companies are prohibited from sending unsolicited advertisements to customers, ""there is no rule clarifying what punishments the enterprises will face if they break the rule,"" said Li Ya, a lawyer with Beijing Zhongwen Law Firm. ""There are no punishments and no deterrents,"" he said. Apple Inc recently said it is exploring ways to reduce spam, including using advanced technology to identify unsolicited messages and rolling out more tools to block unwanted downloads. It has been working to reduce spam for some time, according to the China News Service. Li welcomed the move, but he said the more crucial and urgent issue is to pay attention to privacy leaks, and solve it by legislation. ""We've made legal efforts on privacy protection in recent years, such as providing heavier punishments for those stealing others' information and highlighting protections in our civil laws, but this has not been totally effective,"" he said. ""The articles dealing with privacy protection are scattered throughout 14 laws and regulations instead of being concentrated within one,"" he said. ""Each of them is only loosely related, let alone powerful enough to combat problem. ""According to existing regulations, judicial authorities and technology companies as well as government authorities are doing their own job without communicating with each other. So it is unclear who should play the leading role and what responsibilities each party will take when a privacy leak occurs,"" he said. China has been carrying out periodic campaigns to address the problem. For example, Beijing police detained 138 people suspected of selling, illegally providing and obtaining citizens' personal information during a crackdown in May. ""I don't think occasional crackdowns are an effective way of eradicating the problem,"" said Yan Chuan, a colleague of Li who handles privacy infringement disputes. Yan added that privacy-related legislation should be put on the agenda as quickly as possible. ""Many companies can block or remove users' unwanted information on their platforms by advanced technology, but they don't do that because of the current weak rules,"" Yan added. Zhu Wei, an associate professor at China University of Political Science and Law, also supports new legislation. ""We need a unified law to figure out which party's interest should be more protected or which should take more responsibility if personal data is found to be stolen,"" he said. ""We also need a new law to be a 'bridge' between scattered articles, guiding law enforcement departments to do their work efficiently and accurately."""
1,"Ninety-six million domestic visits were made by travelers during the Dragon Boat Festival holiday, up 7.7 percent compared to last year, according to the Ministry of Culture and Tourism. Revenue generated increased by 8.6 percent, reaching over 39 billion yuan ($5.6 billion) over the weekend. Destinations with cooler weather and attractions with water-related entertainment were the hottest choices by travelers to avoid sunstroke during the holiday. According to the ministry, about 37 percent of travelers chose destinations with cooler weather to beat the heat. These included some coastal areas and mountainous areas. Also, 15 events in celebration of Cultural and Natural Heritages Day, which fell on Saturday, were held in cities like Beijing, Tianjin and Guangzhou in South China's Guangdong province, to present a variety of activities for the holiday. For example, free admission to Beijing's Summer Palace was offered to travelers. Traditional activities, such as dragon boat racing and eating  pyramidal-shaped holiday treats made of glutinous rice and other ingredients, are popular among travelers during the three-day break."
0,"Cheng Yajing is a gardener with ""magical power"" to make plants grow faster in a greenhouse at the Beijing Botanical Garden, also a playground of succulent plants such as cactus, vines and potted juicy leaves. ""I've just finished trimming and fertilizing them,"" says Cheng, as she walks through the greenhouse covering a total area of 1,000 square meters and spells out names of various plants. Lophophora cristata, a distinguished mutant plant with a history of more than 100 years, with hundreds of colorful hybrids, is a blast from the past, she says. Cheng, 43, decided to conduct research on succulent plants and cultivation after she graduated from the Beijing University of Agriculture in 1998. But she set herself the goal of becoming a professional gardener much earlier-when she was in high school. Cheng was one of the first batch of people who started to explore the splendor of succulent plants, but she didn't expect the small pots would become a craze for millions of Chinese. It was not until 2011 that the succulents industry in China started to boom, aided by cyber publicity. A long-distance athlete since primary high school, Cheng has always been dedicated to things she loves, such as replacing soils and pruning messy branches in the garden. And despite being allergic to pollen, she did not give up on this career. As leaves from the succulent plants fall, Cheng carefully collects them and grows them again in relatively good soil. She has also traveled to the botanical gardens in South Africa several times to learn how to better take care of the plants. Over the years, she has brought back more than 1, 000 species of different succulent plants.,But horticulture is facing a crisis, says Cheng, as, according to her, the average age of various professionals in gardens and scenic spots is 45 and positions like groundskeepers and display workers are often left open. Also, the demand for horticulture professionals is growing as the market has boomed in the past 10 years. So, as plant growers reach retirement age, there are too few gardeners arriving to replace them, says Zhao Shiwei, the chief engineer of the Beijing Institute of Landscape Architecture, the only municipal public welfare landscape research institute in Beijing. ""There's an obvious gap in plant cultivation and maintenance talent in recent years, especially those who have an overall understanding of horticulture landscape designs and garden flower cultivation,"" he says. Zhao also says that horticulture involves a wide range of fields, and a long period is needed to train professionals. ""More importantly, the work is relatively tedious for young professionals. Nowadays fewer young people are keen on the horticulture industry, and we are concerned that the industry is facing difficulty to attract and retain talent,"" he adds. As for front-line gardeners, many of them are known as ""city farmers"" as they need to weed and mulch for the plants.,According to the Beijing Forestry University, the top forestry-related academic institution in China, only half of their graduates majoring in horticulture in 2018 chose to work on horticulture-related fields. And it says the percentage is declining. Zhang Qixiang, a professor of horticulture and former vice-president of the Beijing Forestry University, says college graduates account for only 5 percent of the total number of workers employed in the garden industry. And, he says, this is despite horticulture being closely associated with people's lives and the fact that it can be helpful in tackling environmental and social issues, including the effects of climate change, the lack of access to fresh food and extreme weather. ""On a wider scale, horticulturists should focus on the construction of national parks and development of urban green spaces,"" he says. ""And flower decoration and home gardening are also something horticulturists should keep an eye on."" But due to the long gestation period and its overlap with agriculture, and the fact that the horticulture industry is relatively labor intensive, many undergraduates are not keen to enter the field, says Zhang. Zhao, the chief engineer, also says that in the past 10 years, a rapid development of horticulture can be seen in China. In the late 1980s, only three universities had garden-related majors, but now many colleges and academic institutions are offering these courses.,According to Zhao, the boom in horticulture education is closely related to the growing market demand, especially for those who can use high technology for planting. So, a lot of gardens in Beijing are also calling for more high-skilled talent. But the gap between jobs and takers is so obvious that the industry has gradually become polarized with undergraduates and graduates preferring to become researchers and scientists in the field working for large-scale greenhouse operations and entrepreneurs. And, also though landscape crews and workers are often urgently needed, sometimes only rural migrant workers in the city can fill the gap. Higher salary is another aspect that young professionals consider. So, even as the market thrives, some companies have not raised salaries, says Zhao. Meanwhile, the 2019 Beijing International Horticulture Expo will be a valuable opportunity for the whole industry in China to attract more horticulture talent, says Zhang Qixiang. As an A1-level expo, the highest rank, the Beijing 2019 has attracted more than 100 countries and international organizations to participate in the event. The 162-day expo is aimed at displaying the latest achievements in floriculture and fruit cultivation, as well as vegetable farming worldwide, and is expected to see 16 million visitors from home and abroad. ""Horticulture is the direct way to connect your life with the green lifestyle. Also, gardening at home can raise people's awareness of green protection,"" says Zhang. And as many young people in China now lack a basic understanding of plants and their value, the expo will help them learn how to protect our earth, he adds. Cheng is also a keen supporter of the expo. And she has been part of the team decorating the China Pavilion, one of the main ones in the expo garden, since January this year. She plans to bring her daughter, who is in primary school, to the Beijing Botanical Garden during the summer vacation. ""I enjoy communicating with plants at work, to make myself fully blend with the environment,"" she says."

0,"BEIJING -- China's forestry authority has initiated an annual national campaign to encourage Chinese to go out in Spring to plant more trees and turn the country green. A special banner has been placed on the front page of the website of the National Forestry and Grassland Administration, displaying the slogan ""Where to go in spring? Plant trees and make China green."" On Tuesday, China's 40th Arbor Day, the administration and the National Greening Commission also sent messages to mobile phone users, encouraging them to plant more trees. A day earlier, the first commemorative stamp in honor of Arbor Day was released in Beijing to mark the 40th Arbor Day. The stamp, with a face value of 1.2 yuan, bears the image of a pair of hands which resemble the branches of a tree. Above that tree, a beautiful scenery features green leaves, a stream of water, mountains, birds and houses. Liu Dongsheng, deputy director of the administration who attended the release ceremony, said Arbor Day had become an important occasion to arouse public awareness of green development. According to a statement issued by the administration, China plans to add 6.73 million hectares of afforested areas in 2019 to further expand forest coverage. The forest coverage rate of China has increased nearly 10 percentage points since the late 1970s, with the world's largest area of planted forests and an 80-percent expansion of forest areas, said Zhang Jianlong, director of the administration. In 2018 alone, China planted 7.07 million hectares of new forests and treated more than 6.66 million hectares of degraded grasslands, according to a communique on China's afforestation conditions released Tuesday. Participants from all walks of life took part in various voluntary tree planting activities last year, including ministers, generals, and leaders and cadres at all levels, the communique said.,Many government departments also took part in environmental efforts. In 2018, China's transport sector spent 8.79 billion yuan (about $1.3 billion) on highway greening, afforesting 79,000 km of highway, while housing and urban-rural development departments constructed green passages, with per capita urban green park areas reaching 14 square meters, it said. Chinese people have also been keen to participate in a virtual tree planting project in the mobile payment app Alipay. The project rewards low-carbon acts such as renting a bike or taking the bus with ""energy"" to ""water"" virtual trees, and the organizers will plant a real tree in deserts in China when a virtual tree grows up. A study using data from NASA satellites confirmed China's efforts on afforestation. Data shows that China and India are leading the increase in land greening and concludes that the ""effect comes mostly from ambitious tree-planting programs in China and intensive agriculture in both countries."" In line with NASA's data, the greening rate of many Chinese cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Nanchang and Shenzhen saw an increase instead of a drop amid rapid urbanization, according to an ongoing study of the Chinese Academy of Forestry. Beijing has launched large-scale afforestation projects over the past few years, leading to an increase of 10 percentage points in forestry coverage in plains in just four years, the study showed. Besides land greening efforts, afforestation projects in Beijing also took into consideration forest quality and animals' needs by choosing plant and tree species with long life-spans or those that can provide food for wild animals. ""In the past, we only considered the needs of human beings. Now, we stress more on biodiversity,"" Deng Naiping, head of the Beijing Municipal Forestry and Parks Bureau, was quoted by Beijing Daily as saying. Deng said animals and human beings can share green space thanks to scientific tree species choices, which will contribute to harmonious coexistence between man and nature in the long term. Under a long-term afforestation plan, China expects to increase its forest coverage rate to 23.04 percent by 2020, and to 26 percent by 2035, as part of the plan to build a Beautiful China."
1,"For many Beijing natives, the beverage brand Beibingyang or Arctic Ocean carries powerful memories of their pasts, but also the history of the city itself. Though more than a half century has passed since Beibingyang was first rolled out from an old ice-making factory in Beijing, the brand, with an output of one million bottles each day, falls short of market demands now. In the 1980s, Beibingyang dominated the soda market before it built a joint venture with the US-based PepsiCo in 1994. After that, the popular fizzy drink disappeared from the shelves of Chinese stores. This held true until 2011, when the best-selling orange soda reappeared after the company won brand management back from the US beverage giant. Let's look at some pictures from its processing and bottling factory."
0,"BEIJING - China will pay farmers to turn animal poo into fertiliser and power, the Ministry of Agriculture said on Wednesday, as Beijing cracks down on agricultural pollution that has for years leaked into rivers and lakes, angering Chinese residents.  China will give farmers subsidies to build animal waste processing facilities to make fertilisers or to treat manure so it's safe for disposal, and to install biogas plants that use methane to generate electricity, according a government plan announced on Aug 1.  The plan includes setting up recycling programmes by 2020 in 200 major counties that have livestock farms. That's less than half the 586 major counties the government says have hog and poultry farms.  The agriculture ministry gave no details about the size of the subsidies, but the move could be a big step towards curbing chemical fertiliser use and cutting water pollution.  ""We will help the farmers fully understand how organic fertiliser can improve energy efficiency and the environment,"" said Zhong Luqing, director of the fertiliser department at the ministry, at a briefing on Wednesday.  Biogas technology, which can help save on electrical costs, is too expensive for many farmers unless the government helps.  Those researching and using organic fertiliser will also get preferential treatment on loans, taxes, power use and land rent, Zhong said.  Getting rid of animal waste is a major headache for livestock producers worldwide, partly because of the strong odour and damage caused to the atmosphere by the release of harmful gases. Run-off containing animal wastes can also seep into the water table and contaminate rivers and lakes.  In China, how to better dispose of animal waste has become a particular problem due to the fast growth of poultry and hog farming over the past decade to meet demand for higher quality meat. Chinese livestock farms generate nearly 4 billion tonnes of waste annually, according to the agriculture ministry.  ""We will strengthen policy support and increase subsidies to support farmers to use organic fertiliser ... especially large-scale farmers, family farms and cooperatives,"" Zhong said.  The plan is part of Beijing's effort to limit chemical fertilisers and pesticides, which have contaminated soil and water. China uses about one-third of the world's fertilisers.  Beijing has said it was targeting zero growth of chemical fertiliser and pesticide by 2020. It has urged farmers to use less chemical fertiliser and turn to animal manure instead. Reuters"

Your eyes are busy looking around, Wang Jin, a veteran Kunqu Opera actress from the Northern Kunqu Opera Theater in Beijing tells a group of students at a training class in Beijing. ""Press your toes into the ground and let your heels rise. Just take your steps quickly and lightheartedly."" About 10 students from Beijing Zizhong Primary School, both boys and girls, gathered at the third floor of the National Center for the Performing Arts in Beijing recently and followed Wang's instructions as they walked around in a circle. They were playing the role of a young woman. During the 40-minute class, Wang demonstrated the basic techniques and movements of the 600-year-old Kunqu Opera. ""I've never walked like this, which is the typical walk of a female role of traditional Chinese opera,"" says one of the students, Zhang Minqin, who is in the fifth grade. ""I am more familiar with the way of male role walks. But it is funny to walk like a girl."" Zhang is no stranger to traditional Chinese opera since he started learning Peking Opera about two years ago after participating in a free training program organized by the NCPA. ""Most of the students have never watched Kunqu Opera performances before and I try to make this ancient art form come alive and be of interest to them,"" says Wang, in her 40s, who has been involving in training amateur students during the past five years with the Northern Kunqu Opera Theater. ""They don't necessarily become professional Kunqu Opera actors when they grow up. But I believe the experience of performing Kunqu Opera will let them get closer to the traditional Chinese arts."" That afternoon, Zhang was among more than 1,200 students from Zizhong Primary School and the primary school affiliated to Beijing No 166 Middle School to participate in public art programs organized by the NCPA.,Besides Kunqu Opera, students also received training in choir singing, drama and painting. More than 700 students' parents joined their children's courses that day. As a part of the ongoing celebration programs to mark the NCPA's 10th anniversary, drama shows, instrumental performances and dance works by students from the two schools were staged at the NCPA in mid-December. In 2014, the Beijing municipal government launched a project to introduce arts education into the capital's primary schools. The NCPA was among the first of 28 organizations to participate in the project. During the past three years, the NCPA has brought 24 shows to the two schools and invited students to watch more than 400 shows at the venue, involving more than 85,000 students in total. ""Many children are learning musical instruments like the piano and violin in China. Besides the chance to learn music, we also let them act, paint, read and write poetry, too. All of those programs give the students a new language,"" says Wang Dayu, director of the NCPA's art eduction department. She notes that the NCPA has a slogan－art changes life－and for the young generations, art plays a key role in their education. Li Chengyuan, an 11-year-old student from Zizhong Primary School, says that artists from the NCPA have been coming to his school to offer art classes once a month and he also visits the venue to watch shows every month. He has become a member of the NCPA's student drama troupe since he was 7 years old and made his debut performance at NCPA last year, acting in one of the roles in the drama Wangfujing. ""I asked my best friend to come with me in the beginning because I wasn't brave enough to speak in front of so many people,"" says Li. ""Now I am much more confident performing onstage."" Jiao Miao, a conductor with the NCPA Chorus who graduated from the China Conservatory of Music, says: ""Art programs teach students to have better links between the knowledge they learn from textbooks and the actual experience of performing onstage."""

0,"Beijing's construction regulatory body confirmed on Thursday that transformation of five existing venues for the 2022 Winter Olympics has started with an emphasis on diversifying their post-Games functions. The National Indoor Stadium in Beijing's Olympic Park has drifted away from the athletic spotlight since it was taken over in 2010 by the Beijing Performance and Arts Group, mainly a host for concerts and shows. The stadium, built for gymnastics, trampoline and handball for the 2008 Summer Olympics, is now buzzing with activity to prepare it as the venue for men's ice hockey events in the 2022 Olympics. The stadium and nearby National Aquatics Center or Water Cube are among the five existing venues in downtown Beijing being transformed for competition and noncompetition purposes at the 2022 Games, according to the Beijing Major Projects Construction Headquarters Office. ""The transformation of all five venues will be implemented sticking to core principles of cost-efficiency, energy savings, high-tech and sustainability,"" said Huang Hui, director of the office's urban construction department. ""The venues will be able not only to host winter and summer sports competitions but also stage various events to serve the public and commercial purposes."" The indoor stadium, with a capacity of 18,000, will use a water-source heat pump system for temperature control and cooling for its ice rink. It will be more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly due to extracting or dissipating heat using water, according to the office. Other major upgrades include the replacement of some of the venue's current structures with glass walls, to maximize natural lighting, and a new air-purifying system. The aquatics center, used for swimming and diving for the 2008 Games, will become an ice cube to host the curling competition for 2022, with the transformation to be completed in the second half of 2019, according to the venue owner. ""To transform a summer sport venue into a curling arena capable of hosting ice-based sports and entertainment activities helps diversify the functions and revenue sources of this facility,"" said Yang Qiyong, general manager of the center. The changes involve filling the pool with steel structures, leveling the ground with a retractable layer of concrete and producing ice surfaces. After completion of upgrades in power supply, humidity control and cooling systems, it will take about a month to switch it to ice or to return it to a swimming pool. However, the venue team has to overcome challenges in temperature control to keep the ground cold enough for ice while the upper layers stay warm enough for spectators, Yang said. As the oldest of 26 venues for 2022 in three zones - downtown Beijing, Yanqing district and co-host Zhangjiakou - the Capital Gymnasium, built in 1968, will stage short-track speed skating and figure skating at the Winter Olympics after having played host to commercial skating shows such as 2016 Amazing on Ice. The transformation will focus on upgrading the venue's interior and the sound and lighting systems while maintaining its time-honored exterior look, according to the plan. The upgrades of three more Beijing 2008 venues - the National Stadium or Bird's Nest, the Wukesong Arena and the National Conventional Center - will take place in 2020. They will be repurposed, respectively, for the 2022 opening and closing ceremonies, women's ice hockey and media operations."
1,"Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era is China's Marxism in the 21st century with originality and features of the era, a senior Communist Party of China official says. Xi's Thought should be fully learned, since it makes a major, original contribution to developing Marxism, said Wang Huning, a member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau, while addressing a symposium in Beijing on Friday on the recent publication of the second volume of the book  .     In addition, Xi's Thought offers an action guide for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and sheds light on the direction for building a community with a shared future for mankind, said Wang. Following publication of the book's first volume in 2014, the second volume was published earlier this month by the Beijing-based Foreign Languages Press in Chinese and English language editions. The second volume collects 99 of Xi's speeches, conversations, instructions and letters between Aug 18, 2014, and Sept 29 this year. The CPC Central Committee's Publicity Department and Organization Department jointly issued a notice recently, instructing Party organizations at all levels to take the book's two volumes as authoritative books for getting the gist of Xi's Thought and that of the 19th CPC National Congress. Wang called for great efforts in using the book's essence to ensure that the Party's innovative theories effectively boost thinking, guide practices and promote works. The second volume offers a record of how the CPC Central Committee, with Xi Jinping at its core, led nationwide efforts in developing socialism with Chinese characteristics, and it shows the evolution and fruits of Xi's Thought, Wang said. The volume also displays China's wisdom and solutions for building a community with a shared future for mankind and for boosting peace and development, Wang said. Publicity abroad for the two volumes should be reinforced to boost global understanding of Xi's Thought, Wang added. Huang Kunming, head of the CPC Central Committee's Publicity Department, said Party officials should take the lead in translating what they learn into political capability and governing capacities."
1,"Just six days before more than 3,000 VIPs were due to land in the small Swiss ski resort of Davos for the annual World Economic Forum, its organizers issued a warning of grave global challenges. In its Global Risks Report 2019, the WEF highlighted several climate-related risks as well as those posed by a slowing world economy, geopolitical rivalry, weapons of mass destruction, cyberattacks, the spread of infectious diseases and large-scale migration. ""Global risks are intensifying, but the collective will to tackle them appears to be lacking. Instead, divisions are hardening,"" said the report. The report cautioned that the idea of ""taking back control""-whether domestically from political rivals or externally from multilateral or supranational organizations-resonates across many countries and issues. This was probably a reference to United States President Donald Trump's America First policy, Brexit and growing populism in several industrialized nations, widely viewed as anti-globalization forces. Geopolitical tensions are rising among the world's major powers, and these tensions currently represent the most urgent global risks, the report said. ""We are moving from a unipolar to a multipolar world. We are also moving from a uni-conceptual to a multi-conceptual world,"" Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the WEF, said at a news conference in Geneva, on Tuesday. ""Dialogues in order to create mutual understanding are more necessary than ever before because we have to look at how in a world in which we do not necessarily share values, we share at least common interests,"" said Schwab, who founded the forum in 1971.,His comments came as several prominent world leaders canceled their trips to the annual gathering to cope with domestic issues. Trump announced on Jan 10 that he would not go to Davos due to a partial federal government shutdown and his fight with the Democrats over funding for a wall on the Mexican border. On Thursday, the White House confirmed that Trump had canceled his delegation's trip to Davos due to the government shutdown-the longest in US history. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had all been expected to attend and speak at a number of high-profile events to explain the often controversial policies of the Trump administration. French President Emmanuel Macron, haunted by 10 weeks of massive protests by the yellow vests movement, also canceled his trip to the WEF, which will be held from Tuesday to Friday. United Kingdom Prime Minister Theresa May, whose Brexit deal was defeated last week in Parliament but who narrowly survived a no-confidence vote, will also miss Davos to deal with the turmoil at home just 10 weeks before her country is due to leave the European Union. However, Schwab said he is proud of the unprecedented participation from emerging powers, such as the more than 140 Chinese participants-with 11 at ministerial level-and more than 100 attending from India. According to a study by multinational banking and financial services company Standard Chartered released early this month, China and India will be the world's top two economies by 2030 measured by nominal GDP using purchasing power parity exchange rates. By 2030, seven of the top 10 places will be dominated by emerging economies, which also comprise Indonesia, Turkey, Brazil, Egypt and Russia. Vice-President Wang Qishan will attend the WEF while also paying an official visit to Switzerland. He is scheduled to deliver a speech on Wednesday afternoon. Other prominent world leaders who will attend include Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, new Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. Some 65 heads of state and top international organizations are expected to be among about 3,000 government, business and civil society leaders from the more than 110 countries attending.,On Monday, just a day before the formal start of the WEF, Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, will present an update on the World Economic Outlook-a survey conducted and published by the Fund-in Davos. She is likely to renew the IMF's call on countries to foster cooperation to tackle challenges that extend beyond their borders, curb excess imbalances, strength-en inclusive growth, build resilience and improve convergence prospects for low-income developing countries. In its World Economic Outlook report in October, the IMF cut its global growth forecast for last year by 0.2 percentage points to 3.7 percent partly due to trade tensions between the US and its trading partners. The IMF warned that escalating trade tensions and the potential shift away from a multilateral, rules-based trading system are key threats to the global outlook. It said intensified trade tensions and rising policy uncertainty could dent business and financial market sentiment, trigger market volatility and slow investment and trade. The IMF has long warned that higher trade barriers would disrupt global supply chains and slow the spread of new technologies, ultimately lowering global productivity and prosperity. More restrictions on imports would also make tradable consumer goods less affordable, harming low-income households disproportionately. The comments have been widely interpreted as pointing to the Trump administration's unilateral and protectionist trade policies, which have inflicted costs on the US economy and others that are now deeply integrated in global supply chains. Theodore Pelagidis, a professor of economic analysis at the University of Piraeus in Greece, said, ""I expect that Davos 2019 will focus on the coming economic slowdown, indeed in an unstable political context of increased social polarization driven by nationalistic populism both in Europe and the US."" He attributed the rise of populism to the breakup of the middle class in Western countries. ""As an economic slowdown is in front of us, political polarization is expected to become even more radical and aggressive,"" he said. Pelagidis, who is also a nonresident senior fellow of the Brookings Institution in Washington, believes the WEF may contribute to a better understanding of what lies ahead. ""And by trying to define uncharted waters, it could lead to the realization of the high political and economic risks that the global economy is going to face in the next couple of years,"" he said. Peter Bottelier, a visiting scholar at Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies in Washington, said the annual WEF meeting should definitely focus on the merits of multilateral approaches to solving and addressing global challenges. ""I hope that the meeting will openly and honestly discuss President Trump's ill-considered, mercantilistic, retrogressive, illegal and dangerous trade policies, especially vis-a-vis China,"" said Bottelier, a former World Bank official whose roles included being head of the bank's resident mission in China. China and the US have engaged in a tit-for-tat tariff war in recent months, since the Trump administration fired the first shots at China and other major trade partners last year. But many observers have seen signs for cautious optimism in recent weeks after renewed bilateral consultations between Beijing and Washington. Trump tweeted on Jan 8, ""Talks with China are going very well"". Vice-Premier Liu He will visit Washington on Jan 30 and 31 for further consultations on trade and economic issues, the Ministry of Commerce said on Thursday.,While the China-US spat is likely to draw much attention in Davos, the theme of this year's gathering-Globalization 4.0: Sharing a Global Architecture in the Age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution goes far beyond trade wars. Globalization 4.0 has been interpreted by some commentators as a bid to build a world order and international architecture under the new political realities of the 21st century, including taking into consideration factors such as inequality, the rise of populism, the invention and disruption caused by new technologies, and the outdated global governance system. Organizers said Globalization 4.0 is aimed at finding new models for peace, inclusiveness and sustainability. ""This fourth wave of globalization needs to be human-centered, inclusive and sustainable,"" said Schwab, of the WEF, who was among 10 foreigners to be granted the China Reform Friendship Award in December. Many experts have stressed that Globalization 4.0 must better address the problems faced by people who have been left behind both in the developed and developing worlds. Schwab said the world is entering a period of profound global instability brought on by the technological disruption of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and the realignment of geoeconomics and geopolitical forces. ""We need principals from all stakeholder groups in Davos to summon the imagination and commitment necessary to tackle it,"" he said. In a recent article titled Globalization 4.0: The Davos 2019 Manifesto, Schwab cited the fact that national leaders came together after World War II to design a new set of institutional structures to enable the post-war world to collaborate toward building a shared future. ""The world has changed, and as a matter of urgency, we must undertake this process again,"" he said. At the WEF, government, business and civil society leaders will offer their perspectives on what Globalization 4.0 should look like. Many experts believe that the world, including government and business leaders, is underprepared for the challenges and opportunities brought by the Fourth Industrial Revolution., New technologies, such as digital, will be a key topic in many discussions. While the technologies are likely to cause disruptions across industries and societies, Schwab believes they could also help underdeveloped regions, such as some in Africa, to catch up and narrow the gap with other areas. Chen Shengqiang, CEO of JD Digits, a leading Chinese digital technology company, will be among many tech chiefs from the country attending the WEF this year. He believes the data-driven economy continues to transform global value chains and to promote more economic players from different regions worldwide into the wave of globalization. ""Represented by digital technology, the Fourth Industrial Revolution changes a company's internal operating model, generates a data-driven global economy, helps to build a community with a shared future for mankind and to break 'self-centered consciousness' in the concept of value,"" he said on Saturday. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, an ardent advocate of multilateralism and action over climate change, will share his vision on Thursday in a conversation chaired by Borge Brende, president of the WEF. Guterres reiterated the importance of multilateralism in a speech at the UN headquarters in New York on Friday. ""As we look to the challenges we face-from climate change to migration to terrorism to the downsides of globalization-there is no doubt in my mind that global challenges require global solutions,"" he said. ""No country can do it alone. We need multilateralism more than ever,"" Guterres said his ""absolute priority for 2019"" is to make sure the UN is a ""platform for action to repair broken trust in a broken world and deliver for people."""
1,"BEIJING - Currently based in Beijing, James Lalonde has co-founded two companies in China in the last five years. His first startup company, Yodo1, has become a leading private publisher of mobile phone games in China. An American previously based in Silicon Valley, Lalonde started his career at Microsoft in 1990 and since then has held a number of executive roles in several software companies, such as McAfee and Brocade Communications Systems. In an interview with Xinhua on Saturday, he said China's huge market potential for mobile phone games attracted him to start businesses in the country. ""I think it's the best place to do a startup in the world,"" Lalonde said. ""China has the largest market, the fastest growth and the productive people."" He was attending the launching ceremony of the International Talent Innovation Accelerator (ITIA), a new innovation hub aimed at supporting overseas startups in Beijing. Located in Beijing's Chaoyang District, the ITIA was jointly built by local authorities and the innovation departments of the several foreign embassies in China, including of France, Ireland, Switzerland, Singapore, Australia, and the Netherlands. ""Entrepreneurs all over the world are welcomed in China and the business environment is very vibrant here,"" Lalonde said. Over 500 entrepreneurs and startup owners from all over the world attended the ceremony on Saturday. Besides Lalonde, many other entrepreneurs were also keen to pursue their business ambitions in the Chinese capital. Among them is Jonas Wolf, a 29-year-old German business owner and the China director of Angelhack, an international IT consulting firm. ""It is a great platform to share capital, experience and information,"" Wolf told Xinhua, adding that China's preferential policies are favorable for entrepreneurs to start their businesses. ""I also want to realize my dream here by means of building my own brand,"" said Wolf. The Chinese government is committed to providing support and convenience for global companies to establish businesses in China. Many government-backed programs have helped foreign entrepreneurs to enter the Chinese domestic market. ""Actually, Chinese consumers are getting more sophisticated,"" said Jan Smejkal from the Czech Republic. Smejkal is the China and Asia Pacific director of Startup Grind, a startup community aimed at educating, inspiring and connecting entrepreneurs. ""The spending power of the (Chinese) middle class is really high, which makes the Chinese market quite competitive,"" he added. According to Smejkal, here in China, Startup Grind's main focus is on the innovation sector. Describing China as one of the innovation hubs in Asia, Smejkal said China is now a leader of innovation in the region. ""There are a lot of things happening in terms of innovation and entrepreneurship, providing a model for the other regions in Asia,"" he said."

The paralegal from Nanjing in Jiangsu province was then naturally excited when it was transformed into a mobile phone game, and he downloaded it as soon as it was released last year. ""This online game turns a static novel into a dynamic one, with three-dimensional plots and scenery,"" Zhang said. Perfect World Co Ltd developed the historical epic where players compete to be immortal by completing tasks such as gaining access to a fairy castle. ""I can feel a sense of immersion when I play the game, especially since I have read the whole novel before several times,"" Zhang said. The spinoff from online literature to games marks another step forward in intelligent property rights. This involves an array of industries such as films, games, animations and comics. ""Online literature has always been an important part of our entertainment strategy, which takes good IP products at its core,"" said Xiao Hong, chief executive officer of Perfect World. The gaming industry environment has been revolutionized by the emergence of online literature. For years, Perfect World used the IP rights to stories and transformed them into games or films. Now, its Zongheng.com site has become the biggest literary platform in China. ""We are trying to build a pan-entertainment ecosystem by bringing together worldwide cultural resources,"" said Xiao. ""We are catering to consumers' fast-growing needs for entertainment and communication."" The integration of different cultural resources has injected fresh impetus into online games adapted from literature. This in turn has created a mini virtual world where players can communicate with each other. In terms of choosing online stories for the gaming community, Perfect World tends to go for popular works with strong storylines, such as supernatural sagas. The Beijing-based company reported in March that revenue in 2016 jumped more than 25.9 percent to 6.16 billion yuan ($932 million). About 4.7 billion yuan was from the gaming sector. Earlier this year, Perfect World co-developed Lie Huo Ru Ge, a kung fu fiction-based game, which was adapted from a novel and TV series. ""We will ink more cooperation agreements centered on IP for the gaming sector,"" Xiao said. ""We want to produce more new products combining games and comics."""
1,"Transactions in residential properties continued to decline in July as a result of tightened housing policies and financing for homebuyers, particularly in key cities in China. The combined space of transacted residential properties in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen was 2.4 million square meters, down 17 percent month-on-month, or 46 percent year-on-year, according to data from China Real Estate Index System, Beijing-based real estate market information provider. In 16 second-tier cities, including those with fast net population inflows such as Wuhan, Chongqing, Nanjing, Chengdu and Qingdao, the combined space of transacted residential properties in July declined 4 percent month-on-month and 23 percent year-on-year to 12.28 million square meters. ""Tight lending for homebuyers and policies encouraging the leasing market impacted homebuyers' sentiment,"" said Gao Jing, an analyst with CREIS. Real estate professionals said both buyers' and sellers' enthusiasm is declining. ""For buyers, it is really difficult to get their applications for home loans approved, as lending has tightened significantly since the beginning of the year,"" said Yang Zhaojun, a real estate agent with Shanghai Junda Realty Services. ""For sellers, the average price is not rising as fast as it used to. Sellers would think they might yield higher returns when the price grows further,"" said Yang. Policies encouraging the leasing market have also led some potential buyers to become tenants. Zhai Xin, a 28-year-old project manager with a telecommunications technology company in Shanghai, abandoned his plan to buy an apartment in suburban Shanghai, and rented an apartment in the downtown area instead. ""With my imited budget, if I want to buy a home, I can only afford a small apartment far from my workplace. Now I see more policies encouraging the leasing market, such as those giving more rights to tenants. Other cities have enabled tenants to have access to public services on a par with homeowners. Given these trends, I believe renting a home may bring me a better quality of life,"" he said. Hu Jinghui, vice-president of Beijing-based BACIC, a real estate services provider, said the residential market is now returning to a stable and healthy situation as cities across China implement policies to ensure that housing is for accommodation rather than speculation. ""A long-term mechanism to stabilize the market is one of the most important goals. Besides policies to adjust supply and demand, and controlling speculation, more measures in terms of lending, property ownership policies, and taxation policies are needed,"" said Hu."

Eighty percent of the interior construction has been completed and all of the external construction has been finished, according to the new Beijing airport's office. The water supply pipeline network and transformer substations for electricity are ready. The natural gas pipeline is being built and will soon be put into use, said Cui Xiaohao, deputy head of the Beijing Commission of Development and Reform and deputy director of the airport office.,""The new airport will help the capital to serve international travelers better when it opens,"" he said.

1,"Wanderlust-driven Chinese tourists have taken a shine to Eastern European countries like the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland, and are heading there for the April 29-May 1 May Day holiday. Many of them are adding their annual leave to the holiday for an extended overseas vacation. According to Beijing Utour International Travel Service Co, a major outbound travel operator in China, the number of groups going to Eastern European destinations this holiday is expected to be around 60, four times that of last year. Typically, each group comprises 200 tourists on average. The surge is in line with a recent trend. Even last year's figure was 300 percent that of 2015. ""This year we hope the Eastern European business will grow more than 200 percent,"" said Chen Binchao, product manager at Utour. ""Chinese travelers who have been to Western Europe two or three times already are trying to explore something new. With a naturally romantic air, Eastern European countries are most appealing in the seasons of spring and autumn,"" she said. Chen said their travel packages are priced between 10,000 yuan ($1,452) and 30,000 yuan. A typical trip lasts about 10 days. According to LY.com, a Suzhou-based online travel agency, nearly 20 percent of prospective travelers said in a survey that they plan to travel overseas during the extended May Day holiday. LY.com's survey report suggests that more than 60 percent of travelers plan in such a way that their overseas trips last between six and 10 days. About 24 percent stay more than 10 days overseas, and about 15 percent choose a shorter trip that may last up to six days. Those who cannot afford a trip to Eastern Europe or prefer to travel in Asia are choosing islands, including those in Thailand. For example, Phuket in Thailand is the top destination for Chinese people travel independently, followed by China's Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan and the Maldives. Coastal and inland Asian cities such as Osaka, Chiangmai, Okinawa and Sabah are also popular. An increasing number of young Chinese travelers are keen to experience Universal parks in Japan and Singapore. Children prefer to visit Disney Parks in Tokyo and the night zoo in Singapore, where adult travelers like to visit Gardens By the Bay. Ctrip statistics show outbound Chinese travelers prefer to stay in highly rated hotels, with about 71 percent staying in four- or five-star hotels and 22 percent in three-star hotels. Nearly half of the surveyed by LY.com hoped to travel long distance within China, with about 20 percent eyeing places nearby, in second- and third-tier cities. According to Ctrip, one- or two-day trips to neighborhood tourist attractions are most popular during the three-day holiday. More than half of those surveyed said they will travel for sure; and about 40 percent settled for such short trips. Sanya, Xiamen, Guilin and Beijing are primary destinations for domestic tourists. Independent travelers going to Guangzhou have increased more than 300 percent and those to Beijing have gone up 162 percent, according to Ctrip.com. The number of tourists going to Sanya, Xi'an and Hangzhou has doubled from that of last year's May Day holiday. Tourist sites around Hangzhou, Chengdu, Suzhou, Qingdao, Xiamen and Zhuhai are among travelers' favorite destinations for the May Day holiday. Accordingly, hotel reservations for the April 28-May 2 period have surged in second- and third-tier cities. ""They have created huge demand, a new record for two years,"" Ctrip said in a note. The number of tourists to Qingdao city, Shandong province, East China, has grown the fastest, with reservations up 1.77 times that of the same period last year. This means, the number of visitors to Qingdao will likely grow between 2.5 and 3 times this holday, Ctrip said in its report. For the Pearl River Delta area, the Shanghai Disney Resort has become one of the most popular destinations, followed closely by the Palace Museum in Beijing, and Guangzhou Chimelong Tourist Resort, according to a report released by Ctrip. Theme parks have seen a surge in advance bookings. More than half of those scheduled to visit the Shanghai Disney Resort this holiday would do so with family members. Of them, about 15 percent will travel with two children. Those aged between 26 and 35 form the majority of those visiting theme parks. Local parks complete with tourist boats and exhibitions have also seen a holiday-related rise in advance bookings in recent times. For instance, ticket sales at the Gucun Park in Shanghai rose more than 650 percent during the Tomb Sweeping Festival in April. Natural wonders such as the Yellow Mountain, Wuyi Mountain and Putuo Mountain are among the preferred destinations. Among historical sites, Wuzhen and Xi'an (of terracotta warriors fame) are top attractions for tourists aged between 36 and 45.,"
0,"The Ministry of Transport will take steps to boost the development of autonomous driving technology in China, according to Minister Li Xiaopeng. ""We have selected some areas of Xiongan New Area, Zhejiang province and Xiamen, Fujian province, as pilot zones for the technology,"" Li said at a news conference in Beijing on Thursday. ""We will also cooperate with other countries to accelerate the development of autonomous driving,"" he added. Li stressed that autonomous driving, as a rising, cutting-edge technology, is of great importance to China in terms of safety, efficiency, services and the development of industries. ""China is paying great attention to the development of this technology. Our principle is to encourage trials, allow failures, ensure safety and oppose monopolies,"" he said. Autonomous driving, although a new concept, has been embraced by many people. A survey released in November 2017 by JD Power, a global marketing information services company based in the United States, found that almost 80 percent of Chinese consumers welcomed autonomous driving, although they might have concerns about the safety of the technology and the lack of related laws and regulations. To root out people's concerns and ensure better development, the Ministry of Transport created China's first regulations for road testing for autonomous vehicles in April, jointly with the Ministry of Public Security and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, Li said. In July, the Ministry of Transport released guidance on how to build safe closed test sites for autonomous driving. So far, three closed test sites nationwide - in Beijing, Chongqing and Xi'an, Shaanxi province - have been approved by the ministry, Li said. The one in Xi'an released some draft guidance on testing on Wednesday, Xinhua News Agency reported. According to the guidance, drivers and vehicles that have passed inspections are allowed to test autonomous vehicles in designated open areas of the city. Only enterprises or research institutes that have mastered the technology can perform tests, and they must have the financial ability to pay for accidental losses and to monitor and control the vehicles. Accidents during the tests will be handled in accordance with the city's laws and regulations on traffic safety, the guidance said. Li said autonomous driving will take some time to be well applied. The ministry will work with other ministries and commissions to set up national guidance and standards. ""Legislation in the field should follow,"" he said."

Last year, the capital had 198 days when the air quality was defined as good — an increase of 22 days over the amount in 2013, according to the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau's annual Beijing Environmental Statement. Readings for PM2.5 — fine particulate matter with a diameter less than 2.5 microns that is harmful to health — stood at 73 micrograms per cubic meter last year, on average, a 9.9 percent year-on-year decrease. However, this year Beijing should aim to lower PM2.5 levels to 60 micrograms per cubic meter, according to the national action plan against air pollution released earlier by the State Council, China's cabinet. Last year, Beijing issued 17 emergency alerts for air pollution, including one red alert and three orange alerts — the two highest levels in the four-tier emergency response system. In total, the emergency alerts lasted for 36 days, the statement said. When the red alert was in effect for six days in December, it is estimated that air pollutant emissions were reduced by one third and PM2.5 levels went down 20 percent. In addition to air quality, the capital has also seen improvements to its water quality, the bureau said."

Having attended festival pitches in Beijing for many years, Feng Wei, Motion Picture Association of America China president, is impressed by the increasing influence of newcomers. ""The projects are more mature than what I have listened to for the past few years. Besides sci-fi stories, there are quite a few genre films as well,"" Feng said. ""Every work is well-supported by a group of professionals, who have a very keen market sense."" Feng is positive about the future of Chinese film. ""I think making movies in China is a blessing. We have an audience who are open to various types of motion pictures. Regardless of the budget and scale of the production, people will appreciate a good story,"" Feng said. Netflix plays a crucial role in increasing the overseas distribution of Chinese films. ""The entire North America has around merely 40,000 screens, which makes it very difficult for Chinese productions to reach a broad audience, although Chinese film is among the best international performers in the American market,"" Feng said. Netflix has acquired the streaming rights for  China's first science fiction blockbuster, as well as many Chinese online drama hits such as Day and Night ( ), Eternal Love ( ), and the recent food documentary Flavorful Origins ( ). ""Streaming platforms may offer Chinese filmmakers a new path to gain global viewership,"" Feng said. ""With outlets covering many countries and many languages, they provide extensive supports for Chinese productions."",Deanna Gao, China Film Festival in Paris founder and chairwoman, said the first step is to make Chinese stories more accessible. ""If you want foreign audience to like Chinese films, you need to provide access for people to see them."" Founded in 2004, the China Film Festival in Paris features various Chinese motions pictures. ""To most French people, China is still a nation very far away. But through movies, audiences in France are able to understand and appreciate Chinese culture."" ""Compared with music and fine arts, film and TV shows most directly reflect Chinese people's life. Like a bridge, these works connect people's hearts across different cultural backgrounds,"" Gao said. Gao said that one key element for non-English-speaking audiences to fall in love with Chinese film is translation. ""A good, sincere story certainly can travel abroad. However, it won't happen if the translation is far from satisfactory."" ""Because of a large group of translation professionals, Chinese audiences can easily understand American films,"" Gao said. ""Subtitle translation is an art form. Every project needs to appropriate a budget specifically for foreign language translation."""
0,"BEIJING -- Five students have been put in administrative detention and fined, after a video of them bullying a schoolmate went viral on the internet.  In the video, the victim was standing in a toilet, while the bullies forced him to touch excrement. School uniforms worn by the students indicated that the incident happened in a school in Beijing's Yanqing district.  Police with the Yanqing district Branch of Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau said Monday that the video was taken on Thursday. The seven students involved in the case also extorted more than 100 yuan ($15) from the victim and physically abused him.  Of the seven bullies, two were exempted from punishment because they are under the age of 14, although their guardians were told to be more strict with them, police said.  Education authorities in Yanqing district placed two of the students under surveillance, while gave demerits on the records of four. Another bully was given a warning. The parents of the seven students were summoned for talks.  There have been frequent media reports on bullying in China's schools recent years.  In December 2016, a Beijing mother's article describing her 10-year-old son's treatment at school, went viral. After having a toilet waste-paper basket thrown on his head and being mocked by other classmates, the fourth-grade boy was diagnosed with an acute stress disorder, a mental illness characterized by severe anxiety.  In April 2016, another video went viral showing a schoolgirl being slapped more than 30 times by a group of older girls. Police detained a number of the perpetrators."
1,"'Move surely will destroy the value chain built by the two sides decades ago' The Trump administration's ""reckless"" tariffs are harmful to consumers and the economy in the United States, according to some industry groups and analysts. US President Donald Trump on Monday threatened to slap a 10 percent tariff on $200 billion of Chinese products, in addition to the import duties previously announced on $50 billion in goods. China immediately vowed to retaliate. Zhao Ying, a researcher at the Institute of Industrial Economics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, said modern manufacturing is far from producing a single segment, rather, it has a range of segments, from products design, raw materials procurement, production and logistics. The US' tariff move surely will destroy the value chain built by the two sides decades ago. ""This explains why exporters from the two sides were in a hurry to purchase more products in both parts and finished goods from each other's markets in the first five months of this year,"" said Zhao. Brad Setser, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations, noted that the proposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods accounted for half of the US goods imports from China in 2017. ""No way you get there without putting tariffs on a lot of consumer goods imports,"" whether they are computers, cellphones, apparel, toys and small household appliances, the former Treasury official in the Obama administration, said on his Twitter account. The National Retail Federation, an advocacy group, called the latest tariff threat ""reckless escalation"", saying the tit-for-tat trade fight is catching US families in the middle. ""Higher prices for everyday essentials and lost jobs threaten to sap the energy out of the strong US economy just as most Americans are starting to enjoy the benefits of historic tax reform,"" NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay said on Monday night. Imposing new tariffs on Chinese goods is only an excuse for the US government to irrationally pursue political goals, as it has placed heavy restriction on high-tech exports to China, said Ma Yu, a senior researcher at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation in Beijing. He said the issue of the trade deficit will disappear automatically or drop significantly if the US can trade with China in high-tech products including aircraft engines, inertial navigation systems, lasers, optical fibers, depleted uranium, underwater video cameras and propulsion systems, advanced composite materials and communications equipment. In a White House conference call on Tuesday, Peter Navarro, Trump's trade advisor, dismissed fears that ratcheting up tariffs would harm the US economy. ""Our view is that these actions are necessary to defend this country, and that they are ultimately bullish for corporate America, for the working men and women of America, and for the global trading system,"" Navarro said, as US stocks fell following the sharp escalation in the trade dispute between China and the US. Economists warned that the tariffs would start to slow US growth, The Associated Press reported on Tuesday. The story cited Oxford Economics, a leader in global forecasting and quantitative analysis, which estimated that if the US imposed the $200 billion in tariffs and China responded in kind, US growth could slow by 0.3 percentage point next year. ""By threatening to impose a 10 percent tariff on an additional $200 billion of imports from China, the US President Trump has upped the ante on the trade conflict between the two,"" Oxford Economics said in a research briefing."

The smog is forecast to linger until around noon on Saturday, the national environmental monitoring authority said. Shijiazhuang in Hebei province saw pollution rise to the most severe level, and many other cities－including Baoding in Hebei province, Beijing and Tianjin－reached their second-worst pollution mark by 4 pm, according to the China National Environmental Monitoring Center. The air quality index in Beijing, for example, hit 235. ""The lasting air pollution will cover a wide swath of the northern and eastern regions, and will peak on Friday,"" the center said on Thursday, adding that many cities will see severe pollution on Friday, including Beijing and Tianjin; Hebei's Shijiazhuang, Tangshan, Baoding and Langfang; and Shandong province's Dezhou and Liaocheng. A cold front will bring wind on Saturday morning, and smog will ease gradually from north to south, clearing the skies in Beijing. However, some cities downwind may see pollution worsen on Saturday, the center said. The current spell of air pollution, which is forecast to persist until Saturday, is mainly the result of heavy emissions from local companies combined with unfavorable weather conditions that prevent dispersal, said Wang Shuxiao, professor of environmental studies at Tsinghua University. In response, Beijing and Tianjin issued yellow alerts, the third-highest in the nation's four-tier emergency response system－red (the highest), orange, yellow and blue－on Thursday. Under a yellow alert, construction sites are required to stop all activities that generate dust, and some polluting companies－such as furniture plants, foundries and glass factories－must suspend production. Tianjin has toughened its restrictions on industrial production while alerts are in effect. For example, under a yellow alert, total industrial emissions will be reduced by 30 percent to clear the air pollution, with production halted at all foundries. The severe air pollution typically seen in autumn and winter in northern regions has become a thorny issue, and the Ministry of Environmental Protection has launched a campaign with other ministries and provincial governments to reduce the number of days with severe air pollution by 15 percent from October to March."
0,"To ensure the equal success of the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Games, Beijing has pledged to provide disabled athletes with the same support and access to winter sports that other athletes enjoy and to promote inclusiveness. With less than five years until the 2022 Winter Games, the Beijing Olympic Organizing Committee has emphasized integration of the parasports gala and winter sports promotions among disabled people throughout the preparatory process. That was highlighted in a progress report delivered at the International Paralympic Committee General Assembly  . ""Synchronized planning and preparations for both Games is at the core of our principal guarantee that both events will be equally successful,"" Lu Yong, vice-president of the committee, told China Daily during the IPC conference on Wednesday. As a national plan rolls out to involve 300 million people in winter sports activities leading up to 2022, Lu said that people with impairments should be included to fulfill Beijing's vision for pushing social inclusion and accessibility. ""There is huge potential for improving awareness and facilities for winter sports for the disabled as a means of recreation and rehabilitation,"" said Lu, who is also board chairman of the China Disabled Persons' Federation. The federation, along with officials in Beijing and Hebei province and sports governing bodies, is working to expand parawinter sports to 12 provinces. The number of full-time athletes specializing in parawinter events has risen since 2015 from fewer than 50 to nearly 400. Since 2016, China has hosted 10 winter sports events for people with disabilities. A total of 250 Chinese athletes have participated in 17 international parawinter events. Yet, the lack of training expertise and dedicated facilities has posed a challenge, underlined by China's medal drought at the past four Paralympic Winter Games. Lu believes the promotional efforts will make a difference by 2022 but insists that winning medals is not the goal. ""Gaining more attention and support for building an accessible, inclusive and equal environment for people with disabilities is what matters,"" he said. Sixteen venues, all for the 2022 Winter Olympics, will be used to host paralympic sports as well as for hospitality and media functions. Rita van Driel, an IPC Governing Board member from the Netherlands and a member of the Coordination Commission of Beijing 2022, said Beijing is well on track to once again deliver a successful Paralympics. ""Beijing showed in 2008 that it was able to deliver an excellent Paralympic Games with a great legacy for people with impairments. Building on that experience, I believe it will deliver another extraordinary Paralympic Games in winter as well,"" she said."

""I want them to know that it is these people who changed the Chinese culture, and in their own ways revolutionized the society. I also want people to know that they were people like us; they all got up in the morning to go to work. If their children were sick, it was going to be a tough day. I want the China story to be out there, to be understood and appreciated by the society, the people and the culture. But I also want them to sense the universality of these stories, that in fact, I could go anywhere in the world in any language to tell these stories. They are going to want to know about these stories and these people,  Einreinhofer told China Daily website on Sept 7 while he was filming at Prince Gong's Mansion in Beijing.,""If you have compelling characters, if you have empathetic characters, if you can tell a story, you can draw people in. Once you've drawn them in, you can start to learn the fine part of the story. From one person, you start to learn China from different aspects of history, of culture and the society. That I think it's a lot less scary, lot less confusing than 5,000 years of history."" Apart from filming inside the studio, the program is also shot in the artists' former residences, art galleries, Beijing Opera theater and museums to present the audience with immersive traditional Chinese culture and art experiences. With close cooperation and attachment to the Chinese culture, Einreinhofer's most recent project is a one-hour Public TV documentary  released in 2018.

1,"Company alleges misconduct over copyright dispute with screenwriter Beijing courts have denied claims of misconduct and bias after China's leading ballet company was forced to pay damages over a copyright dispute involving one of its best-known shows. The National Ballet of China was ordered to pay 120,000 yuan ($17,600) to writer Liang Xin in 2015 after losing a lawsuit over the rights to The Red Detachment of Women. After two failed appeals, the ballet troupe was forced to pay up by Xicheng District People's Court on Dec 28, prompting the company to issue a strong statement on Tuesday that accused the judge in the original hearing of ""perverting the course of justice"" and questioned the fairness of the rulings. The statement caused a stir among Beijing court officials and legal experts. In response, the Xicheng court released a detailed explanation for the 2015 verdict and said it will continue to push the company to apologize to Liang's family. The screenwriter died in January 2017. ""We had twice urged the company to follow the ruling (to pay compensation), but it ignored, so we used enforcement measures to take the money,"" the court said on Tuesday without elaborating on the measures. At the original hearing in 2012, Liang said he had signed a deal in 1993 to allow the company to perform the show in exchange for 5,000 yuan, but that deal expired after a decade. He said he had received neither payment nor credit for performances staged between 2003 and 2012. After three years of deliberation, the National Ballet was ordered to pay damages and make a written apology, as it had failed to acknowledge the copyright holder when introducing the production on its website. Both the capital's intellectual property court and high court upheld the verdict on appeal. On Tuesday night, the high court shared the district court's statement about the case via social media, while the Supreme People's Court posted a commentary online defending the ruling. However, the company's statement and those by the three courts were all deleted from the web on Wednesday. Yu Guofu, a lawyer specializing in intellectual property disputes, said the verdict appeared win-win, as it protects the copyright holder and means the works can still be watched by more people. ""All legal avenues have been exhausted in this case,"" he said. ""The company should respect and abide by the ruling, and it must provide evidence if it accuses someone."" In Yu's view, the dispute between the courts and the company is not a bad thing. ""Instead, it's a lesson on the law,"" he added. ""It helps people understand more about court rulings, and teaches us how to protect copyright."" The National Ballet has said the copyright issue means future performances of the show could be canceled. The Red Detachment of Women, which Liang wrote in the 1950s, tells the story of a downtrodden housemaid in Hainan province who joins a troop of female soldiers to defeat a cruel warlord. It was adapted for the big screen in 1961. caoyin@chinadaily.com.cn"

The move brings Chengdu's number of overseas offshore talent bases to 13, the Chengdu Hi-tech Industrial Development Zone said Tuesday.  The talent base will work with the influential Sino-America Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Professional Association and US diagnostic company GIMDX to recruit top global talent.  Chengdu is attempting to compete with larger cities closer to the coast, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, by offering more generous terms and a better environment.  In 2016, the hi-tech zone planned to invest 5 billion yuan ($730 million) to establish offshore overseas talent bases as well as create mass entrepreneurship spaces and offshore incubators, in a bid to attract talent and enhance competitiveness in science and technology.  It also seeks to strengthen cooperation with global innovation hubs such as Silicon Valley in the Unites States, Tel Aviv in Israel and Sophia Antipolis in France.  So far, the zone has attracted five Nobel Laureates, hundreds of top employees worldwide as well 115 Fortune Global 500 companies.

""Lawyers get their legal knowledge from law school, but that doesn't mean they are qualified to defend someone,"" said Zou Jiaming, an attorney from Beijing's King and Capital Law Firm. ""We need more training, especially for attorneys handling criminal cases, to help them put their knowledge into practice."" Although they may have graduated from law school, some lawyers don't know how to read case materials, how to collect evidence or even how to talk with their clients, she added. Zou made the remarks on Friday during a seminar in Beijing organized by her firm. She suggested the Ministry of Justice offer more training for lawyers, to help them better understand legal practices and how to defend suspects in court. In France, she said, lawyers must go through a year of defense skills training after leaving law school before they can begin their career. Fan Chongyi, a law professor at the China University of Political Science and Law, said helping more defense attorneys master such skills would make the country's criminal justice system more professional and efficient. ""We have examinations to ensure whether a police officer can investigate a crime before they start the career, but we have no such test for lawyers,"" Fan said at the seminar. He suggested China's law schools incorporate lessons on defense skills into course schedules, while law firms should also be encouraged to provide training. King and Capital's criminal division now puts its lawyers through written tests, interviews and mock trials before they are allowed to represent a client in court alone, according to Tian Wenchang, head of the law firm."

Li Maohui, assistant president of CCCC, said the company would make use of different investment models including public-private partnership, build-operate-transfer, equity participation, and mergers and acquisitions, to further compete with its established rivals in Spain and Germany, The Beijing-headquartered group will seek alliances with capable foreign companies familiar with the local business environment in overseas markets, Li said. He made the remarks during an Open Day event the group had organized this month to introduce its big-ticket projects such as the Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway in Kenya and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge, in Shantou and Guangzhou in Guangdong province. Supported in different business segments by over 60 subsidiaries such as China Road and Bridge Corp and CCCC Investment Co, CCCC has set up more than 240 branches, research institutes and service hubs in 118 countries and regions. The group has signed overseas contracts worth $170 billion over the past five years. While local economies have benefited from these projects, particularly those related to the Belt and Road Initiative, the company has also enriched its overseas experience in areas such as foreign staff training, and project and risk management, said Li. He said China's new round of reform and opening-up policies, and high-standard international trade platforms such as the China International Import Expo will build a comprehensive platform for Chinese companies to expand cooperation with global companies in areas from equipment procurement to production capacity cooperation in third-party markets, especially in Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. Eager to enhance its market presence in the Americas, CCCC and its subsidiary China Harbor Engineering Co jointly won the bid for the fourth bridge over the Panama Canal with a contract price of $1.42 billion in July. The project will not only be one of the most important engineering programs in Panama and Central America in the next few years but also the biggest bridge project that a Chinese company has won a bid for in the Americas. The fourth bridge - a road-rail bridge - over the Panama Canal will be 510 meters long, 51 meters wide and 75 meters high. Chinese companies have played an important role in driving globalization and contributing to global economic recovery through pushing for free trade, infrastructure development and other forms of investment activities, said Cai Fengxiang, general manager of CCCC Investment. Li Jin, chief researcher at the China Enterprise Research Institute, said the tangible development of the Belt and Road Initiative is critical for Chinese companies and others. For example, the Silk Road Economic Belt starts in China and ends in Europe, and every country between those points is involved. That means the initiative is important for businesses in all destination countries and regions. CCCC is engaged in the design and construction of transportation infrastructure, dredging and heavy machinery manufacturing businesses. Its business scope includes terminals, roads, bridges, railways, tunnels, container cranes, heavy marine machinery, large steel structure and road machinery manufacturing, as well as international project contracting, and import and export trading services."

With its aerial tricks and thrilling action, the risky nature of winter sports provides a feast for fans but demands that organizers put in place sophisticated medical support and first-aid services. With three years to go before the Games, the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics organizing committee has joined hands with local health and sports authorities to develop medical and rescue service standards, teach venue medical staff members how to ski and make emergency preparations for the Olympics, which will be held in downtown Beijing, its northwestern Yanqing district and Zhangjiakou's Chongli mountain district. The organizing committee announced on Thursday that it has selected 41 hospitals and seven disease prevention and blood supply facilities across the three zones, recommended by Beijing municipal and Hebei provincial health commissions, to be official medical partners of the Games. Each facility will open an Olympic green lane staffed by doctors and first-aid professionals specializing in sports medicine to provide timely treatment, the committee said. The medical service providers will also work with venue operators and local governments to streamline transport routes both on the ground and in the air in case a helicopter rescue is needed. ""Winter sports athletes are more vulnerable to severe injuries than their summer counterparts, while we are lacking this particular type of medical expertise as a young winter sports country,"" said Zhang Jiandong, a vice-mayor of Beijing and executive vice-president of the Beijing 2022 organizing committee. ""To improve medical support, especially for alpine events, we will take action early to train our staff, make plans in advance for rehearsals during test events and optimize medical resources."" English speaking skills and ski training are two fundamental requirements for the medical teams that will be based in the Yanqing and Chongli districts, where most of the snow events will be held, according to the organizing committee's Games service department. Beijing's downtown area will stage all the ice sports in 2022. A group of 30 medical professionals from Beijing who are candidates to provide rescue services are now receiving ski instruction at a resort in Chongli, while the Hebei Health Commission revealed that a program guided by its provincial sports bureau has trained 300 similar medical workers. During a test organized in early 2018, only six medical workers among all the staff members from 45 hospitals and medical stations in Beijing and Hebei stood out as advanced skiers, indicating a training gap. ""In addition to staff training, we also established a series of standards, such as the time limit for delivering injured athletes from venues to the nearest treatment venue, which will be fine-tuned through practice events starting at the end of this year,"" said Yu Debin, director of the Games' service department.

1,"BEIJING - Beijing wants the number of convenience stores in its urban and near-urban areas to reach 3,000 in three years so that shoppers will not have to travel far to find a store in the city. According to the municipal commerce commission, four government departments will jointly launch measures to facilitate business. There are currently only about 1,500 convenience stores in Beijing. The commission found through investigation that high costs and complicated administrative formalities are the main obstacles for opening the shops in the city. Under the commission's blueprint, there should be more than 2,000 convenience stores in the city proper so that a convenience store can be found near every residential community, and over half of the stores should operate around the clock. There will be changes in future stores in Beijing, as the commission's new work plan allows convenience stores to sell cooked food, health food and food for special medical purposes. Beijing's new urban planning has led wholesale markets and street vendors to move out to reduce traffic congestion and reduce the population density in the capital. However, urban residents are having difficulty buying food. To address the needs, the commission said it would allow stores to open dining areas and sell beverages and food made by automated equipment. It also encourages stores to offer other services for the convenience of customers, such as laundry and water bill collection. Stores offering such services can apply for government subsidies. The commission said it would encourage chain store operators to open new stores, build processing and distribution centers, and use new technology such as the Internet of Things and big data to improve management and supply efficiency."

0,"After a long journey home, hundreds of Chinese cultural relics repatriated from Italy finally were made available for public viewing on Wednesday at the National Museum of China in Beijing. The 796 artifacts are believed to have been illegally moved overseas. The exhibition runs through June. ""On a flight, it only takes 10 hours to travel from Milan to Beijing,"" Minister of Culture and Tourism Luo Shugang said at the exhibition's opening ceremony. ""However, their journey took 12 years."",The artifacts were found in 2007 at an antique market in Milan by an Italian police squad assigned to fight cultural heritage-related crime, Luo said. Officers suspected the relics were smuggled and confiscated them. The Chinese embassy in Italy was informed of the case in 2008, and China's National Cultural Heritage Administration soon began the process of identifying the artifacts and checking them against export documents. None of the items was approved for export, and most of them showed signs of having been buried and excavated. The Chinese administration filed papers seeking their return and, after a decadelong judicial process, a court in Milan approved their return in November.,In March, President Xi Jinping and Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte oversaw the signing of an intergovernmental agreement in Rome to formally give the green light for repatriation of the artifacts, which arrived in Beijing on April 10. ""I'm glad to see this exhibition just before the Belt and Road Forum in Beijing,"" said Ettore Sequi, Italian ambassador to China. ""The new Silk Road of culture is bearing fruit. ""Italy and China are the nations with the largest numbers of UNESCO World Heritage sites,"" he said. ""Given that the two countries are important cultural powers, I think this repatriation will set an example for the rest of world."",The origins of the returned artifacts range from the Majiayao, a Neolithic culture from the third millennium BC in what is now Gansu province, to the early 20th century, according to Xin Lixiang, a veteran archaeologist at the National Museum of China. ""We can see many pottery figurines of camel caravans from the Han (206 BC-AD 220) and Tang (618-907) dynasties, two peak times of the ancient Silk Road,"" Xin said. ""They are typical representatives of their times."" China has gained the repatriation of many lost cultural relics from overseas in recent years. In February, an agreement was reached with the United States for the return of 361 artifacts. But Guan Qiang, deputy director of the heritage administration, said the process isn't easy.,While international conventions prohibited the illicit import and export of cultural properties in 1970 and 1995, respectively, Guan said the process is often tricky, especially with artifacts lost before 1970. ""This repatriation from Italy offers a crucial reference,"" he said. ""But each case requires a plan tailored to its specific situation."",China has signed bilateral agreements to fight cross-border crimes involving cultural relics with 21 countries including Italy, and Guan said the agreements complement the international conventions. ""Diplomatic channels, judicial procedures and negotiation are needed, depending on the circumstances,"" he said. Guan said an exhibition featuring some of the choice cultural relics repatriated in recent years will be held in the near future."
0,"While living in perpetual darkness cannot stop visually impaired people from reaching out for love, other people's opinions can. That's a lesson Liang Jiangbo learned in adolescence. In 2002, while studying at a middle school for blind and visually impaired children in Nanjing, Jiangsu province, the then 16-year-old received a letter in his capacity as class monitor. He opened the letter, which was written in Braille, and discovered that it was from a blind girl in his home province of Anhui, asking about the curriculum and life on campus. Liang replied in detail, and the two quickly became pen pals and later classmates. Though the pair never knew what the other looked like, the congeniality and companionship they felt quickly turned into something more than friendship. They arranged to apply together for a prestigious blind high school in Qingdao, Shandong province, and hoped to later study at the same college. Their intimacy quickly spread around campus and became obvious to Liang's parents, who were more concerned about the inconvenience that could arise from the union of two blind people than fears that the relationship would affect their studies. Liang's parents even went so far as to tell him about the difficulties a blind couple would face when their parents were too old to care for them, and how their children might be bullied for having blind parents who could only offer limited assistance. Gradually, barriers grew between the pair and they broke up before graduation. ""We were both worried by what other people said, and our relationship was affected,"" said Liang, who is now a Braille proofreader with the China Braille Press in Beijing. ""I went on to high school in Qingdao and later to Beijing for college, whereas she chose not to, as a sign of severing ties with me."" Liang is one of a large number of visually impaired people who have been encouraged to downplay the importance of true love and marry partners with better vision. Blind and visually impaired people are categorized as the most vulnerable among disabled people, and are told that they will only make it through life if they marry a sighted person. Influenced by such opinions, visually impaired city dwellers choose to marry sighted rural residents who want urban hukou - household registration - to make their lives easier. Though some relationships turn out to be good matches, large numbers of these utilitarian unions do not last long, according to experts.,In 2011, Liang was working as a radio host at a media company in Beijing when he met his fiancee, an able-bodied colleague. ""We felt attracted to each other. We would often go out for food or karaoke with friends,"" he said. Liang was concerned about whether he was handsome enough, if his girlfriend minded his disability and if he would be able to take care of her as well as an able-bodied partner. But in a country that once had a long tradition of parents arranging their children's marriages, his greatest fear was the objections put forward by his girlfriend's parents. ""When her parents learned about us, they were strongly against us being together, and there seemed no room for negotiation,"" he said. However, the couple remained resolute. They have now been together for seven years, and her parents have accepted the relationship. Over the years, Liang has proved himself as a partner and won his girlfriend's parents over. ""Using a smartphone equipped with screen-reading software, I can order food for her online, and I can also hail a cab and wait at her office after work. If two people are determined to stay together, most problems won't remain problems,"" he said. Shi Ran, a blind employee at China Braille Press, said parental approval matters for such mixed couples because it's almost impossible for them to be entirely independent of their parents after marriage. ""If the parents are not happy with the marriage, there may be problems that could be quite upsetting,"" the 36-year-old single woman said, citing the example of a blind friend who married another blind person. ""Parents on both sides were unhappy about the marriage, but the four seniors have to meet regularly because of their children's conditions. It is torture for everyone involved,"" she said. There is no recent data on the marital status of China's 12.6 million visually impaired people, but experts agree that they are the least favored partners when disabled people choose to marry, along with those with intellectual disabilities. According to a 1983 survey conducted by Teng Weimin, former vice-chairman of the China Blind Person's Association, less than half of the 1,000 visually impaired people surveyed in 10 cities nationwide were married. ""I doubt the number has risen significantly,"" the 64-year-old said. ""In the past, overprotective rules meant it was unusual for disabled partners to divorce. But now divorce has become common if problems arise."",Teng noted that widespread discrimination against the visually impaired is a major contributor to martial hardship. ""Many believe blind people are ultra-dependent and can do nothing on their own, which is not the case,"" said the former optometrist in Beijing, who went blind in 1978 after being infected with tuberculosis bacteria while performing eye surgery. After Teng lost his sight, his girlfriend, a former classmate who is also an optometrist, insisted that they got married. They quickly had a son, but social discrimination led Teng to consider divorce to protect his loved ones from hurt. ""One time, my wife cried in front of me after a colleague told her she was not considered for a promotion because she had to take care of her blind husband,"" he said. ""My son was bullied by classmates many times in kindergarten. They ridiculed him for having a xiazi father, a derogatory term for being blind."" Teng said a lack of involvement with mainstream society lies at the root of the fear and unfriendly attitudes. ""Only a quarter of this group is employed, and most visually impaired people don't have social lives,"" he said. He noted that the lack of contact has led to unfamiliarity and a sense of fear of the group, who are stereotyped as lonely and dependent. However, greater contact with mainstream society would allow blind and visually impaired people to show how much they can do on their own, which would surprise many people. In addition to their absence in the workplace, China two-track education system means disabled and able-bodied children are largely segregated from primary school through to university, so the two groups rarely get an opportunity to meet. Nie Zhongyuan, a media professional who has directed three television adverts designed to raise awareness of the correct use of accessible facilities for the disabled, said the lack of mainstream contact with blind people creates a vicious circle. ""Though China has made strides to promote inclusion in education and the workplace, the lack of accessible facilities has led to visually impaired and blind people being underrepresented in the public sphere. Their absence exacerbates public ignorance of their conditions and the resulting prejudice,"" said Nie, creative director at Huagan Creative Communication in Nanchang, Jiangxi province. Li Zhen, a blind Braille editor at the China Braille Press, said personal charm matters when starting a relationship, but many visually impaired people lack that quality as a result of poor education and minimal social contact. The most recent available statistics - the Second National Sample Survey on Disability in 2006 - showed that 43.9 percent of disabled people were illiterate, and experts said the rate for the visually impaired is likely to be even higher because their disability affects their access to information. To promote integrated education, China rectified the law related to compulsory education in 2015, ordering mainstream schools to accept disabled students who are deemed capable of receiving a standard education. In the same year, the government made it easier for disabled people to take the gaokao - the national college entrance exam - by requiring examining bodies to offer ""reasonable"" assistance. That means visually impaired examinees must be provided with test papers written in Braille or large-print characters. In addition, last year, China made it illegal for schools to turn away disabled people, a common occurrence in the past. Figures provided by the China Disabled Person's Federation show that almost 30,000 disabled people have been admitted to mainstream universities via the gaokao since 2015. Liang said blind or visually impaired people who study on integrated campuses or are employed in nonsegregated workplaces find it easier to fall in love, because people are less prejudiced about blindness, and ""they are less fearful of the condition if they study or work alongside blind or visually impaired people""."
1,"Systems designed to curb Chinese young people's obsession with online gaming require consensus between children and their parents to be effective, experts and tech engineers said.  A government survey of more than 6,200 families in Guangdong province found 23 percent of children aged 3 to 6 spend at least 30 minutes online every day, according to a report released at the Guangdong Youth Cybersecurity Forum in September.  More than 60 percent of 7-year-olds have downloaded games to their smartphones or tablets. At the age of 12, about 88 percent of children use QQ messenger and 70 percent use WeChat, the report said.  ""Children use the internet for similar reasons as adults, such as learning, shopping and social interaction,"" said Su Wenying, a child protection officer with the China Office at the United Nations Children's Fund.  However, she added that there are legitimate concerns that children's development may be affected if they spend too much time online.  In December 2006, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League published a report that said more than 2 million Chinese children and teenagers were addicted to the internet and online gaming. ""It is a severe social problem that could threaten the nation's future,"" it said.  A year later, authorities asked Chinese game developers to add the first version of an anti-addiction system to their games, said Wang Xi, a senior software engineer for an IT firm in Beijing.  In general, he said, anti-addiction systems can be broadly divided into two categories: hard and soft. Hard systems force players offline or stop them from logging in during a certain period, such as the online gaming curfew in South Korea that stops teenage players from logging in between midnight and 6 am, Wang said.  Soft systems do not restrict access, but discourage players from gaming for long periods of time by diminishing loot drops or progression, he added.  ""Both of these systems are inherently flawed because children can easily bypass them by registering using adult IDs, or spending extra time or money to get their favorite item or character faster,"" he said.  Moreover, parents and children often hold conflicting opinions about anti-addiction systems, he said. ""This defeats the purpose of the systems because parents and children are locked in a constant battle to control playing time, leading to crafty children stealing their parents' IDs and credit cards, and angry parents sending their children to internet detox camps.""  Given how many new games come out each day, ""it is hard to hold companies accountable for enforcing the anti-addiction systems"", Wang said. ""Hence other groups in society, such as parents, teachers and legislators, need to view online obsession rationally and work together to address the real needs of the children.""  Children play online games to interact with friends, earn respect from other players, gain satisfaction, and for escapism, Su said. ""Some studies imply that children who are struggling at school or have weak emotional support tend to have a higher risk of becoming obsessed with the virtual world.""  However, Su emphasized that internet addiction is a much-debated and controversial subject, and experts still do not fully understand its causes and long-term effects compared with addiction to substances like drugs and alcohol.  ""Labeling children as internet addicts and sending them to specialized rehab camps can lead to them being stigmatized and harm their long-term mental development,"" she said.  Addressing internet obsession requires effort from all facets of society, both online and offline, Su said. But more importantly, parents should provide an open and caring space to have honest discussions with their children about their daily lives and internet activities.  ""The family is the most important environment for child development, and consensus and mutual trust between parents and children is the key to the issue,"" she said. ""The anti-addiction system only works when both parents and children agree it is for their own good."""

1,"SAN FRANCISCO - A possible US-China trade war could harm China's interests and undermine Chinese-American relations, particularly China's economic and trade cooperation with the US west coastal state of Oregon, Chinese Consul General in San Francisco Luo Linquan said Wednesday. In a signed article carried by the Oregonian daily, the largest one in Oregon and the oldest continuously published newspaper on the US west coast, Luo said that ""trade wars have no winners"" and the free-trade basis for China's economic cooperation with the US and Oregon may be in danger under the unilateral protectionist actions arising from US President Donald Trump administration's threat to slap 25 percent tariffs on a list of 1,300 Chinese products worth $50 billion. In response, China was forced to take countermeasures by announcing it would impose tariffs of 25 percent on 106 types of products from the United States worth $50 billion within 60 days if America's plan becomes a reality, Luo wrote. In the almost 40 years since China and the US established diplomatic relations, both countries and peoples have benefited from economic and trade cooperation. The possible trade war opens Pandora's box that ""exposes the US to the risk of retaliation,"" Luo said. ""Today, China is not only Oregon's largest export market, but also the state's largest source of international visitors,"" he added. As one of the eight states that enjoy a trade surplus to China, Oregon's exports have expanded 55 times during the past 20 years and reached $4 billion annually. He cited Oregon's Nike, the top American company of sports equipment, footwear and apparel, as an example of win-win cooperation between China and the US, saying Nike's sales in China exceed $4 billion as of 2017, accounting for 13 percent of its total global sales. Despite the trade frictions between Washington and Beijing, the door of negotiation is always open, Luo said, adding that ""China wishes to resolve trade disputes with the US through dialogue and consultation on the basis of equality and mutual respects."""

1,"BEIJING - On the east side of Beijing's Tiananmen Square, the National Museum of China draws crowds with its rich cultural relics and artworks. But the world's largest museum also boasts a ""living treasure"" - Zhang Peng, China's most famous museum interpreter. After 15 years as a volunteer interpreter, Zhang has a large following in the museum and on social media. People ask for his duty roster in order to catch his tours. His book on the Forbidden City has sold out in downtown bookstores. Running children keep quiet when he starts speaking. They address the 34-year-old as ""Brother"". Zhang started volunteering in 2003, when he was a law student at university. Unlike his schoolmates who looked for internships, he spent his time in museums. Born in Shaanxi Province, home of relics such as the terracotta army, Zhang loved learning about culture and history. He recalls being mesmerized by treasures he had seen only in textbooks on his first visit to the National Museum. Zhang learned his guide was a volunteer and he immediately delivered his resume. Two months later, he had a volunteer job. Every weekend, he would rise early, and take a two-hour bus trip from his campus to the museum. He would interpret for four or five hours, and head home after dark. ""I like being close to these precious relics. It's fantastic,"" he says, ""and it is free."" Sometimes he also volunteers in other museums including the Forbidden City and the China Millennium Monument. He continued volunteering after starting a paid job. In 2009, he won a national museum interpreter competition, which brought him national acclaim and accolades such as ""Beijing May Fourth Medal"", the highest honor for young Beijingers. Chinese museum interpreters have long been stereotyped as guides who stand firm, recite their scripts monotonously, and have little personal interaction with their audience. However, Zhang believes he has a responsibility to show that a museum interpreter can be a good speaker and inspire people with a desire to learn. Zhang asks questions to involve his audience and enriches official scripts with interesting stories or academic arguments, encouraging audiences to think.,He kneels to eye level with children and speaks simply so they can understand. Many primary schools now invite him to give lessons on cultural relics. ""I have two cupboards of gifts made by my little audiences, including a girl's note saying 'Marry me'"", says Zhang with a blush. Since 2008, many Chinese museums have opened for free. Museum, exhibition and visitor numbers have grown rapidly. By 2016, China had 4,873 museums and more than 30,000 exhibitions were held annually, drawing 900 million visitors. Pictures of sensational exhibitions and rare treasures sweep social media, while books and documentaries are made into period dramas. ""Well-known interpreters are gaining followers. They are one of the most enchanting features of China's museums,"" Pan Shouyong, Professor of Anthropology and Museology at Minzu University of China, told Xinhua on Thursday, the annual International Museum Day. Museums are adapting to the new environment. ""In the past, Chinese museums considered collections and research their priorities, but now they focus on the public,"" says Pan. In 2014, Zhang resigned his post at a state-owned enterprise and started a business educating teenagers about museums. He offers online and offline courses on exhibitions, sells books and organizes study trips abroad. It was difficult at first, but Zhang has confidence, as the government called for social forces to participate in public culture services earlier this year. He still volunteers in museums. ""I want to help young people develop an interest in museums, which are wonderful places to visit again and again,"" says Zhang."

The exhibition is comprised of two independent yet intertextually intertwined sections, continuing Yang Jian's long-term exploration of topics such as space-time, polarity, the peculiarity of power, and the essential absurdity of civilized human life. The exhibition features more than ten entirely new works, including painting, video, sculpture, and installation. A single channel video piece, Trimming Time, leads viewers into an ""arrow of time"" wrestling ring to commence leaping back and forth inside. Five gigantic geometric forms, made of survival blankets purchased on Taobao, represent an investigation into the ultimate truth of ""supremacy"" in art and breathe life into the space. Situated opposite these forms is an iron line graph depicting trends in Taobao consumption data with six abstract line structure and reference compositions clustered at its peaks and troughs. This is an exploration of ideology, cognition, self-awareness, and the hidden rules behind meta-painting, while simultaneously hinting at the entropic association between time, vision, and culture.

Heteroglossia, also known as the theory of polyphony, was a concept introduced by the Russian literary critic Mikhail Bakhtin to summarize the unique characteristics of Fyodor Dostoevsky's novels. The term refers to the coexistence of different languages as well as the conflicts between them, and it also reflects the plurality and fluidity that characterize our contemporary culture and society, where independent, uncompromising voices and ideas come at us through a variety of different agencies, but which nonetheless intertwine with each other and participate equally in the discussions and debates of a shared contemporary landscape. As the theme of this exhibition, Heteroglossia also provides a critical line of inquiry into it and invests the whole exhibition by formulating a dialogue between the artists and a world that has become more and more complex and challenging.

Cui Zhongfu, secretary-general of CFLP said that instant delivery is a fast-growing emerging industry, which has cultivated more than 10 million daily orders in just a few years, and this new economy is breaking the original, realty business model, and pushing them to converge with online business. Instant delivery also provides jobs, and a considerable number of grass-roots distributors come from poor regions. Problem also arises, such as violation of traffic regulations and policies among these riders. There is an urgent call for new industry standards, and also the support from relevant departments. The report is divided into seven parts, which provides reference for enterprises to improve services and strengthen management."
0,"The ongoing Beijing International Art Biennale features paintings, sculptures and installations from more than 100 countries. Lin Qi reports.  Bat-Erdene Damdin-suren, an artist from Mongolia, is participating in the seventh edition of Beijing International Art Biennale with an installation called  a tribute to the enduring influences of Silk Road and Maritime Silk Road as well as wider communication among different civilizations. Speaking about his passion, he says: ""Being an artist is a hard job. But it is the best job for me."" The ongoing event features more than 600 paintings, sculptures and installations at the National Art Museum of China in Beijing, with artists from more than 100 countries. The biennial was launched in 2003 by the China Artists Association. And Damdinsuren says he first showed his work at the third edition of the event－a metal sculpture depicting horses moving in a circle. But he did not attend that event. ""Horses used to be the daily mode of transportation for Mongolians. But these day they are just animals,"" he says, adding that the work examined the connection between the past and the future. Damdinsuren works a lot with metal. He says he collects metal objects and transforms them into artworks. In  he features a red cross made up of two 4-meter-long silk strips on the ground. Then, dozens of metal mousetraps are placed on it, in the formation of four arrows, and they all point to the model of marmot that stands at the intersection of the cross. Damdinsuren says the red cross is to remind people of peace, while the mousetraps and the marmot indicate conflicts.,  He says that when he produced the work, he envisaged a situation where people who toiled along the ancient Silk Road faced dangers and misunderstandings when trying to link the East and the West. Damdinsuren also says that there is another level of meaning in his work. ""The marmot represents any animal that is being slaughtered and dying out because of men's lust for money. Nature should not fall victim to the expansion of human activities."" Some other works on show review traditions being threatened by a commercial culture that has been prompted by globalization. In his oil painting  Indonesian artist I Putu Edy Asmara depicts a snail that has a man's face, and with an empty red soda can as its shell, while its old coiled shell is abandoned on the side. Asmara says that easily accessible digital networks are giving a boost to the exchange between people living in different corners of the world. He says that while pop and commercial cultures are widely spread, traditional cultures are less favored by people, especially the youth. ""The situation now is unlike that of the Silk Road that promoted the intersection of different cultures but didn't make local cultures extinct,"" he says. ""Technology unites people but should not unify us. It's still important for people to have their own life s and to remain distinctive."",  Diversity has been at the heart of the BIAB for the past 15 years. And it is committed to demonstrating not only the variety of artistic creation but also different voices, especially those from less-developed areas, says Xu Li, vice-chairman of the China Artists Association. BIAB cares for artists who need international exposure, he says. Damdinsuren hails from a family of artists. His two daughters are artists, too. He says he has exhibited in Australia, South Korea and Europe and he hopes that more Mongolian artists can show their works globally, so that art can be a profession with good prospects for young people and their families. For Asmara, this is his fourth BIAB having first exhibited in 2008. The 35-year-old from Bali says that although Indonesia has in recent years witnessed a boom in its art scene, artists still find it difficult to find collectors for their works. He says exhibitions like the BIAB bring more attention to Indonesian art.

The partnership is part of a joint effort to improve the dietary structure of Chinese residents. According to a survey,  more than 80% of Chinese adults have insufficient intake of whole grains, resulting in deficiencies of vitamin B, minerals and dietary fibers. At the ceremony, Michael Lindsey, senior vice-president of Nutrition Category & Commercialization of PepsiCo GCR, on behalf of the company donated 60,000 packs of Quaker Oats products to Dandelion Middle School, the first privately-run school for migrant workers' children in Beijing. ""We hope that through the promotion of Quaker Oats' '3 goodness' concept, the concept of wholegrain can be brought to thousands of households,"" Lindsey said.

The peninsula is China's close neighbor and happenings there directly concern China's interests, so it should be expected China has been paying attention to the situation, Li said."
0,"Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing has said it is now focusing on artificial intelligence and smart transportation innovation, as it attempts to expand its booming shared mobility empire into more fields and gain momentum in emerging industries. The company officially launched its AI Labs in Beijing on Friday, marking its latest step in expanding its research into AI-driven innovation, attracting top AI experts and boosting the development of smart traffic technologies. The move came shortly after the Beijing-based startup unveiled an integrated solution for smart city traffic management on Thursday. The technology employs traffic data collected from Didi's platform and data resources from local governments and business partners. ""Didi will not only build a comprehensive mobility platform to connect passengers and drivers, but also aims to become a smart transportation solutions provider in the future,"" Cheng Wei, founder and CEO of Didi, said on Thursday at a smart transportation forum in Beijing. With a team of more than 200 AI scientists and engineers, the company's new AI research lab will be led by Didi's vice-president Ye Jieping. It aims to address transportation-related challenges with a focus on natural language processing, computer vision and deep learning, among other areas. Didi said it has plans to further expand the new hub this year. The company currently operates three AI research labs: its new AI Labs, Didi Research Institute in Beijing and Didi Labs in Silicon Valley of the United States. ""The new AI Labs is dedicated to being a leader in driving cutting-edge transportation and mobility technologies, as well as a generator of AI talents,"" Ye said. He added that the new facility will also promote more AI applications in smart mobility scenarios, such as the Didi Smart Transportation Brain that helps to improve traffic flow efficiency in urban areas. Zhao Xiang, an analyst at Beijing-based internet consultancy Analysys, said by setting its sights on AI and smart transportation, Didi aims to transform itself from a simple mobility service provider into a technology company that offers big data and AI-driven services. ""Once the company is able to connect people, cars, roads, traffic lights and even the whole traffic system, the platform will generate a large amount of data. Thus Didi's future is of huge potential, especially in how it monetizes those services,"" Zhao said. Last year, Didi identified smart transportation as a new strategic direction, offering a wide range of smart transportation products and services for more than 20 cities nationwide, such as smart traffic lights and reversible lanes, to relieve traffic jams. In Jinan, capital of Shandong province, smart traffic signals have been installed on 344 intersections. The solutions have saved more than 30,000 hours of daily travel time for local residents, Didi announced. Cheng said he believes the company will embrace an intelligent, shared and new energy transportation future. ""In the next 10 to 20 years, transportation will transform into an integrated system that enables a central smart city brain to serve drivers, car owners, passengers as well as the entire city."" Raymond Wang, a partner at Roland Berger China, said as smart transportation area does not currently have a clear profit model, Didi's investment in smart traffic was more about demonstrating its willingness to cooperate with the government. At the moment, the company provides a full range of app-based transportation options for over 450 million users nationwide, including taxis, express and premier options, car rental, enterprise-focused and bike-sharing services. With over 21 million drivers and car owners, the Didi platform offers 25 million daily rides."
1,"Beijing will further open its market by allowing a number of wholly foreign-owned companies to provide outbound travel services to customers, a senior official of the city's tourism authority said on Tuesday. Cao Pengcheng, deputy head of the Beijing Municipal Commission of Tourism Development, said the commission was awaiting approval after submitting the document to the Ministry of Culture and Tourism. According to the plan, once the foreign travel agencies meet certain requirements, they will be qualified to take visitors on outbound travel, which means foreign-invested travel agencies will take a share from China's huge overseas tourist market. In 2003, the first wholly foreign-owned travel agency was set up in China. However, there were limitations on its service, as it could not offer outbound travel products. Shi Jianzhong, secretary-general of the Beijing Tourism Industry Association, said once the document is approved, domestic travel agencies' businesses could possibly be affected, but the new measure is the trend of the industry. Zhang Guodong, a publicity official at online travel agency ly.com, has a positive view of the new policy. He said it will not have too much of an impact since China's tourism industry grows 10 percent annually, which is a big market. Online travel businesses develop even faster, with an annual growth rate of 35 to 40 percent. ""Compared with the United States and Europe, whose online travel market is growing at 45 percent to 50 per-cent annually, we still have big growth potential,"" he said. ""Therefore, the new policy is not a big threat to online travel agencies like ly.com."" ""Together with foreign-owned travel agencies, we should cooperate and make the market bigger and better."" As incomes grow and consumption is upgraded, China's outbound tourist market has grown rapidly in recent years. According to data from the ministry, the number of outbound trips by Chinese tourists was 130 million in 2017, up 9 percent year-on-year. Chinese visitors spent $258 billion during their overseas trips, up 5 percent year-on-year."

1,"China and the United States should look at new ways of revitalizing their relationship with emphasis on areas of economic commonality, said former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd. Rudd's comments came as there have been positive developments between the two nations, including Vice-Premier Liu He's visit to the US for economic and trade consultations, and easing the US stance on its sanctions on Chinese telecom-equipment giant ZTE. ""I see a good first step toward some forms of a deal. I hope this can lead to a more stable relationship predicated on economic commonality and mutual understanding,"" Rudd said in a written interview with China Daily. The former Australian prime minister, a China expert who is fluent in Mandarin, said that China and the US can cooperate in a number of areas of economic commonality such as tourism, infrastructure and medical care, as well as new fields such as digital commerce, digital finance and new technologies. China's Belt and Road Initiative can contribute to ""the huge infrastructure deficits"" in the US and the two countries can also cooperate on development projects across the developing world, Rudd said. Rudd suggested that China and the US, as the world's two largest economies, should use the dispute resolution mechanisms established by the WTO to decide the claims based on fact and merit and the two economies should stand to win - both economically and politically - by working together. Rudd is among some 400 current and former government officials, as well as leading global CEOs, who will attend the New Economy Forum held by Bloomberg and the China Center for International Economic Exchanges in Beijing this November. The forum is expected to serve as a communication platform and stimulate dialogue among global business and political leaders, who will likely touch upon issues ranging from trade and investment to the shape of a new global order led by emerging economies such as China and India, and global challenges such as climate change and inequality. Henry Paulson, former US treasury secretary, who will also attend the forum in Beijing, said that dialogue is needed to foster cooperation and for government and business leaders to address global challenges. ""Even when the tariff impasse is behind us, economic relations between the United States and China will continue to be fraught. It's all the more reason why we need dialogues like the New Economy Forum to foster collaboration and results,"" Paulson said."

1,"BEIJING -- Chinese actor Ge You has won a lawsuit against a travel company that used his image without permission. The image used by the company was taken from the sitcom ""I love my family,"" and shows Ge lazing on a couch. The photograph has also become a Chinese Internet meme known as ""Ge You-esque slouching"" and is used by netizens to express their laziness. Beijing-based travel company eLong was found to use the photo and other Ge portraits for advertising a garment brand on a company social network account in July 2016, according to a statement by the Beijing Municipal First Intermediate People's Court on Saturday. The company mentioned Ge's name several times by saying ""Ge You-esque slouching"" in photo captions, according to the statement. After a complaint by the actor, eLong deleted the photos in August 2016 and issued an open letter of apology in December of the same year. Ge believed the apology was another form of commercial promotion, and filed a lawsuit against the company at the Haidian District People's Court. In the first instance, the Haidian court ruled that eLong must pay compensation of 75,000 yuan ($11,842) and apologize to Ge for infringement of image rights. The municipal court accepted eLong's appeal in January, but ultimately backed the Haidian court ruling. Ge You is a household name in China. His films include ""If you are the one,"" ""Sacrifice"" and ""Be there or be square."""

The solo exhibition, entitled A Journey through Cultures, presents Pigeau's works on Chinese Buddhism, Taoist beliefs and the porcelain culture, besides works on the ancient Mayan civilization of Mexico. Pigeau, who graduated from l'Ecole nationale superieure des Beaux-arts de Paris, has been traveling around countries with ancient civilizations since the 1990s, creating contemporary art pieces with inspiration drawn from historical and cultural scenes. His friend, French critic Philippe Piguet described his works as in a form between architecture and sculpture.,Piguet thinks Pigeau's works are able to invite the audience to reconsider and get to know about the world. Pigeau's Chinese destinations for artistic inspiration have included Beijing, Hangzhou in Zhejiang province, Leshan in Sichuan province, the grottoes of Gansu province's Dunhuang and Henan province's Longmen, as well as Dehua county, in Fujian province, known for white porcelain produced there. Three pieces of his series Akade, or meditative spaces, are exhibited, conveying his understanding of Buddhism. The outer surfaces of two of these works, one made of plaster and another of marble, look like samsara pagodas, while the hollowed-out golden insides resemble the contours of the Buddha.,However, he used only plaster to create the third work on show, giving it the look of a hollowed-out Buddha in of traditional Chinese folk style. Pigeau's gilt plaster work Emptines is also being shown at the exhibition. For the work, he says he was inspired by cong — a traditional jade cylinder used in religious rituals, with its outer layer being square and the inner layer being round. The sculpture, which looks like a roofless cube and has a small, rectangular ""window"" on one side and a mirror at the bottom. Meanwhile, Pigeau has been living in Dehua, studying the white porcelain techniques and culture there. His 2017 work Dunhuang is an uneven circular ring with a crack that looks like outline of the reclining Buddha in Dunhuang.,Similarly, another white porcelain work has the outline of the Leshan Giant Buddha. Besides sculpture and installations, the exhibits also include pinhole photography works and charcoal paintings of the Great Wall and Lama Temple in Beijing, the Longmen Grottoes in Luoyang, in Henan province, as well as the Lingyin Temple in Hangzhou. Pigeau uses simple techniques to embody great inner strength, says Yi Xi, the curator. The exhibition runs through May 19."

She was born in the summer of 2008 and her name means Olympics in Chinese. Wang is a member of the Yanqing Youth Speed Skating Team. And she once won the women's junior group 400 meters in the Yanqing's ""Mini Winter Olympics"" youth speed skating competition. Her skating training began in 2016 at a large ice rink built by the school.,The Beijing Yanqing Taipingzhuang Central Primary School is a full-time rural primary school. And Wang's training rink is located in the east campus of the primary school. It was originally a farmland where teachers and students planted corn and vegetables. But in November 2016, with the support of the Yanqing district education committee, the Taipingzhuang Central Primary School spent more than 800,000 yuan ($118,092) to build this 1,800 square meter seasonal ice rink, and equipped students with skates and protective gear. The school then hired a retired physical education teacher, Li Chunyu from Manzhouli, Inner Mongolia, as the children's skating coach.,Now, more than 140 students from the school practice ice sports for one hour every day in winter. The ice rink was completed in less than two years, and has become an ice paradise for the students. In addition to a fixed hour of free ice-time every day, students can also join the skating interest group after school for on-court training. Also, many parents learn to skate while waiting to pick up their children.,""An ice rink is easy to build but maintenance is a problem,"" says Ding Jianpei, the headmaster of the school, adding that in order to maintain the ice rink a lot of work is needed. In order to ensure that the rink is in good condition, Ding ices the rink the first thing in the morning. And later in the day, the teachers, students and parents clean the ice to prepare it for use at night. ""When the temperature is too high, it is not good. But generally, when the temperature drops to -8 C, we pour ice,"" he says.,According to Ding, pouring of ice is usually carried out in the middle of the night. If the weather is bad (high temperature), they will spend the whole night doing it. The hard work done by Ding and the teachers is rewarding. Almost all the students in Taipingzhuang Central Primary School have learned to skate. And many students have already participated in competitions in Yanqing district, with many achieving good rankings.,This ice rink has also led to the development of the students on the ice project of the adjacent Kangzhuang Primary School, the Xiayu Primary School and the Xiaofengying Primary School. ""We want to plant the seed of winter sports in the hearts of students. ""This seed may not grow into a towering tree as most of them will not engage in snow and ice sports, but as long as they realize the joy of winter sports while growing up I feel that what we are doing is worth it,"" says Ding."

Calling the UN ""the flag of multilateralism,"" Xi said the world has been more in need than ever of multilateralism and a stronger UN as the rising unilateralism and protectionism is dealing a blow to the international order and the system of global governance. The most fundamental principle of multilateralism is to address international issues through consultation in accordance with the collectively agreed rules, with each country's interests and concerns taken into consideration, Xi said. Noting that China has always firmly supported multilateralism and safeguarded the UN's authority and function, Xi said China expects the UN to play its leading role in upholding fairness and justice, safeguarding world peace and promoting common development, especially in deepening global cooperation and in tackling challenges facing the world. China's resolve in comprehensively deepening reform is unchanged. The country is ready to take concrete actions to unite with all parties to uphold liberalization and facilitation of trade and build an open world economy, Xi said. Noting China's long-time friendship and shared destiny with Africa, Xi said China does not attach any political strings, nor does it seek any privilege or special interest in China-Africa cooperation. ""We will make unremitting efforts and do a good job as long as we believe it benefits African countries and people,"" Xi said. The FOCAC is a model of South-South cooperation and the Beijing summit will focus on unity, cooperation and common development, which are highly consistent with the UN's goals and purposes, he said. He called on the UN to take Africa as a priority in its work and support African countries in solving their problems in African ways so as to achieve long-term peace and stability on the continent. The UN should help African countries speed up development, support their unity, self-improvement and integration, and make their voice and influence greater in international affairs, Xi said. China is willing to strengthen communication and discussion with the UN on how to better support Africa, Xi said. Guterres said African affairs have always been a priority on the UN agenda and his attendance to the Beijing summit is evidence of the UN's support of Africa and China-Africa cooperation. As a model of South-South cooperation, the FOCAC will make important contributions to world peace and development with demonstrative significance, he said, wishing a complete success of the summit. He praised China for its commitment to supporting multilateralism, actively safeguarding the multilateral order and improving global governance when multilateralism is facing severe challenges. China's development, a trend that cannot be halted, is of great significance to the cause of world peace and development, he said. The UN is willing to strengthen dialogue and cooperation with China to build a rule-based multi-polar world and encourage other countries to participate in the Belt and Road construction, he said. Guterres also expressed his gratitude for China's great efforts in tackling global challenges including climate change despite difficulties. The UN expects more support from China on global governance and regional hotspot issues, he said."
0,"China's ever-growing fascination with fitness has triggered a marathon craze among the country's health-conscious middle class, but lax management has often meant race organizers have struggled to keep pace with the demand for their events. Whether it's throngs of participants jogging past Tian'anmen Square during the Beijing Marathon or sweat-soaked amateurs plodding the trails of the Olympic Forest Park, disciples of distance running are now a daily part of life in the Chinese capital. The roaring demand for the Beijing Marathon, the country's oldest race founded in 1981, is symptomatic of the boom. The 37th edition of the race last month attracted 98,687 applicants for 30,000 places, up 48 percent on the previous year, with organizers the China Olympic Road Running Co. using an online lottery to determine the starting list. However, sometimes a runner needs more than just luck to secure a spot in a race. Before the 2016 Nanjing International Marathon in November, local media reported that a second-hand place in the event's half-marathon sold for 1,999 yuan ($302) on shopping portal Taobao. The official registration fee was 80 yuan. Bragging about your marathon participation is a sure-fire way to boost your social-media status, too, as evidenced by the one-billion-plus views of photos and posts bearing the hashtag #Beijing Marathon# on Sina Weibo, China's Twitter-like service, on the day of this year's race. ""The Beijing Marathon has become a phenomenon larger than just the race itself thanks to the growing awareness of mass fitness and the promotional effect on social-media platforms,"" said Wang Jian, general manager of China Olympic Road Running Co.,    ""No other sport has a lower entry requirement than running. All you need is a pair of running shoes and you can go hit the road, regardless of age or gender,"" said Wu, an experienced runner himself. ""There's a strong sense of accomplishment after finishing a run, whether it's a 5k or a marathon, and that's proving highly contagious thanks to social media. ""Once you take up running, it's easy to contact like-minded enthusiasts on social-networking platforms such as WeChat. ""The sense of belonging and the mutual encouragement that exists within the running community is very enticing for many. Running is becoming a sort of new 'sports religion' in China."" Meanwhile, local governments have tapped into the running bug, using races, especially televised ones, to promote tourism in their respective areas. According to the Chinese Athletics Association (CAA), 2.8 million people took part in 328 registered long-distance running events across the country last year, with remote areas such as Lhasa, the capital of Tibet autonomous region, increasingly popular as locations. The association estimated that more than 600 races, attracting about five million runners, will be staged by the end of 2017, almost 20 times the number of events held five years ago. Those figures still pale in comparison to participation levels in countries such as the United States, however. According to Running USA's annual report, about 1,100 full marathons were held in the US last year, with an average of 500,000 runners completing the 42.195 kilometers. The respective figures in China were only 125 and 142,000. ""Marathon running has been gaining great momentum recently, but the potential remains largely untapped, given China's huge population and the vast landscape,"" said CAA vice-president Wang Dawei.,With the number of events skyrocketing, cheating has become a problem, underlined by a number of embarrassing and even deadly incidents recently. After this year's Beijing Marathon, a photo of three runners with the same ID number went viral, exposing long-existing issues of people fabricating bibs or trading entry spots illegally to run without registration. The organizing committee of the Beijing race launched a probe into the incident and threatened to permanently suspend the perpetrators. Cheating to enter a race can have serious consequences. During a half-marathon in Xiamen last December, a runner who was later found to be competing under someone else's name, died of a heart attack after first-aid treatment based on the original participant's information failed to work. The deceased runner's family sued the race organizer for more than 1.2 million yuan ($180,000), but a district court overturned the plaintiff's appeal on Sept 21. Following the Xiamen race, the CAA issued a new regulation that requires all race organizers to tighten scrutiny on registrants and impose lifetime bans on cheats. ""In a lot of early cases, runners didn't trade entries for money but just passed them on to others so that the entries were not wasted,"" said Tan Jie, of Chinese running magazine Front Runner. ""They just didn't realize how big a risk it posed."" Organizers of some elite races have been planning to stamp out identity cheats with face and fingerprint recognition technology. ""The development of the marathon industry should be accessed by quality rather than quantity,"" said Adam Zhang, founder of the Key-Solution sports marketing and consulting agency. ""Organizers should realize that the runners' all-round experience is much more important than the number of registrants or the reputation of a race."" Providing proper facilities, such as sufficient hydration for example, is just as important as course design and traffic control, Zhang added. Illustrating Zhang's point well is the case of the 2013 Beijing Marathon, when photographs of competitors urinating on the walls of the Palace Museum (aka the Forbidden City) caused uproar. The following year organizers added another 160 mobile toilets around the start and finish areas to prevent a repeat of that embarrassment."
0,"CHANGCHUN -The airport in Changchun, capital of Northeast China's Jilin province, will see more flights in the coming winter and spring season to meet the rising demand from tourists. The winter flight schedule runs from Oct 29 to March 24. During the period, Changchun Longjia International Airport is expected to have 1,764 flights every week, up 12.8 percent year on year, the airport said on Saturday. Many airlines, including China Southern, China Eastern and Xiamen airlines, will open routes to cities such as Chengdu, Shantou, Guiyang, Hangzhou and Nanchang, with more passengers expected to visit the province known for winter tourism. Frequency of flights to major cities, including Beijing and Shanghai, will be increased, according to the airport. Northeast China, including Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces, is a popular winter destination for tourists. Famous resorts in Jilin include skiing resorts of Songyuan and Changbai Mountain. China is expecting a boom in winter-sport tourism as the 2022 Winter Olympic Games in Beijing approach."
0,"Beijing will not allow any ""Taiwan independence"" secessionist to split China, An Fengshan, spokesman for the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office, said on Wednesday. The comment came against the backdrop of recent visits to Taiwan by two officials from the United States after US President Donald Trump signed a bill called the Taiwan Travel Act, which encourages reciprocal visits between Taiwan and the US by officials at all levels. Alex Wong, deputy assistant secretary of the US State Department's Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, visited Taiwan from March 20 to 22. Another US official, Ed Royce, the House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman and a Republican, visited the island after Wong. The visits increased friction in cross-Straits relations. Beijing opposes the travel act and has urged the US to adhere to the one-China policy, and it initiated negotiations on the issue to urge the US to adhere to the three joint communiques that lay out the two countries' mutual understanding. ""The mainland's major principle toward Taiwan is clear and consistent,"" An said in response to a China Daily question about ""armed reunification"". ""We will work in utmost sincerity and make our best effort to strive for peaceful reunification,"" An said. ""Our determination to safeguard our country's territorial sovereignty is steadfast. We will not allow any 'Taiwan independence' force to separate the island from China."" President Xi Jinping delivered a speech on March 20 at the closing meeting of the first session of the 13th National People's Congress in which he vowed to defeat secessionist attempts. The speech was seen as a strong warning to Taiwan. ""Any actions and tricks to split China are doomed to fail. And these separatists' actions will be met with the condemnation of the people and the punishment of history,"" Xi said. He also said that the Chinese people ""have the resolve, the confidence and the ability to defeat secessionist attempts in any form"". An article about the tactics of Taiwan reunification by military force - written by Lieutenant General Wang Hongguang, a retired deputy commander of the former Nanjing Military Command of the People's Liberation Army - was published on the website of Global Times on Tuesday. Global Times is a subsidiary of People's Daily. At the end of the article, Wang introduced what he said would be his next topic concerning military action: ""Taking Taiwan in less than three days"". Zhu Songling, a professor of Taiwan studies at Beijing Union University, said, ""Reunification cannot be stopped. It is China's domestic issue."" The signing of the Taiwan Travel Act ""greatly harmed cross-Straits and China-US relations"", Zhu said. ""We should realize it is not a good sign, and should pay more attention at the tactical level."""
0,"BEIJING -- Beijing has issued a guideline for restaurant toilets, to improve sanitary conditions of the city's 5,000 restaurants this year, Beijing Youth Daily reported Friday. Released by the municipal food and drug administration Thursday, the guideline has more than 40 regulations on the environment, facilities, cleaning and disinfection. Restaurant staff must check sanitary conditions every hour, and every 15 minutes at meal time. All toilets should be disinfected at least once a day, and other facilities such as faucets, sinks, handrails, hand dryers and air vents should be disinfected at least four times a day. The guideline prohibits restaurants to use personalized toilet signs that are difficult to identify. Restaurant toilets should also have partitions, mirrors and disposable toilet seat covers. ""The guideline marks the beginning of a 'toilet revolution' in Beijing restaurants,"" said Duan Zhiyong, an official with the administration. In 2015, China launched a toilet revolution nationwide to make public toilets cleaner and more regulated. Chinese leaders called for continued efforts to upgrade the country's toilets. According to Duan, the guideline will be promoted in Beijing's public food service sector, with 5,000 restaurants expected to improve their toilet environment and services by the end of the year."

0,"An English teacher in Kunming has been told to apologize for a fine and reward system she imposed on her students and give back money she took, amounting to 50 yuan per wrong answer each teenager made in mid-term exams, reported the Beijing Youth Daily. Zhao Sha, who worked at Kunming No 10 Middle School, posted an account online on Nov 7 detailing how the fines she levied had totaled 3,950 yuan ($596), the newspaper said.  In addition to the charge for wrong answers, students were required to pay 10 yuan for each point they fell short of a set target. The money taken was used to reward students who made progress and also pay for extracurricular activities. Some pupils fared better than others. While 12 received rewards, the remaining 28 in the class were fined. Parents told the newspaper their representative committee at the school had never discussed the scheme. A staff member said the school had not granted permission, and was now investigating. Han Xiao, a lawyer from Beijing Kangda Law Firm, was quoted by the newspaper saying that there were no legal rights for teachers or schools to fine. ""Parents should have reported the matter promptly to avoid its impact on students' psychological health,"" Han said."

Zhou Zhengyu, director of the commission, said Beijing would soon introduce guidelines for shared bike development, including requirements for parking, safety and management. Shared bike providers will be asked to set up digital fences to promote orderly parking. Beijing currently has 13 start-ups that provide bike sharing services and over 1.6 million shared bikes in use. Zhou also introduced other efforts, including cooperation with Internet firms, in building a smart transport management system, where all kinds of traffic data are collected and timely analyzed. The commission's Transportation Operations Coordination Center runs on 41 systems and real-time data collection of 6,000 items. Beijing also plans to integrate the data of 3 million parking lots onto the same platform for shared use and better management."
1,"BEIJING - On the 40th anniversary of its reform and opening-up this year, China will inject more vigor into global growth by opening up further as it enters a new stage of development. This comes at a crucial moment for globalization, with trade protectionism rising in the West. The new policy, outlined by President Xi Jinping earlier this month at the annual conference of the Boao Forum for Asia, the continent's top economic forum, highlights more measures for free trade and investment, including lower tariffs for automobiles and other imports. In a following inspection tour of Hainan, a southern Chinese island province that is host to the Boao forum, Xi said it will be developed into a pilot free trade zone, gradually becoming a free trade port with Chinese characteristics. China's annual contribution to global growth surpassed 30 percent in the past five years. The new moves are expected to generate new market demands and create new growth points. This momentum comes with changes in both the size and structure of domestic consumption, signaled by a 15.2-percent year-on-year growth in goods imports in January and February combined. Notably, 177,000 vehicles were imported in this period, marking a 14.3-percent increase in value. The first China International Import Expo will be held in Shanghai in November, providing a significant opportunity for more foreign goods and services. Over 1,600 enterprises from more than 120 countries and regions confirmed their participation by the end of March, indicating the worldwide interest in China's huge market. Already the world's second largest investment destination, China anticipates more foreign capital, especially in the manufacturing sector. The progress made in listing China A shares in the MSCI Emerging Markets and world indexes is expected to open a new channel for global investors. With more quality ""Made in China"" products being exported, the first two months of this year saw a year-on-year increase of 18 percent in exports. Chinese exports today range from raw materials and clothing to mobile phones and more innovative products. Since 2015, China has become a country of net capital outflows and will continue to increase its overseas investments, as Minister of Commerce Zhong Shan has said. The investment focus will likely be on building cooperation platforms in countries related to the Belt and Road Initiative, a grand proposal put forward by Xi in 2013 and dedicated to promoting common development and prosperity. In addition, the world is also witnessing an expanding use of the Chinese currency as a new option in international payments and settlements, which is part of the reform of global economic governance. By further opening up, China is expected to forge closer links with global growth and contribute more to a freer, fairer and more inclusive multilateral trade system."
1,"The China arm of Schneider Electric, the Rueil-Malmaison, France-headquartered company, is seeking to collaborate with various businesses in Shanghai to integrate the internet of things, or IoT, into traditional industries. John Tuccillo, senior vice-president, industry and government affairs at Schneider Electric, believes the IoT can be used in different industries as part of digitalization of manufacturing. The IoT can be described as a network of devices, vehicles, buildings and other objects that contain software or sensors that allow them to connect and exchange data. ""The application of the IoT will push not only the manufacturing industry ahead but other related fields, such as sewage disposal, healthcare, transportation and energy,"" said Tuccillo. ""Making different systems function together is what makes the IoT different to the internet of consumption. The IoT not only makes manufacturing more automatic but connects different systems."" Eager to compete with other established rivals such as Swiss company ABB Group, the US-based General Electric and Germany's Siemens AG in the same field, the company promoted EcoStruxure, its open, interoperable, IoT-enabled system architecture in Shanghai last month. EcoStruxure has been already adopted by China Baosteel Group, one of China's largest steel producers by output. It helps Baosteel to increase safety of operators and non-operators in the workshop and improve productivity. Daily output will likely increase 15 to 30 percent to reach up to 10,500 tons. Schneider Electric now earns 45 percent of its revenue through the IoT. The platform combines operational technology and information technology into one management interface. Users can easily access the system to practise various complex operations. The whole procedure is as simple as tapping smartphone apps. ""It's like an industrialized Android system,"" said Ma Yue, senior vice-president, industry business, Schneider Electric China, the company's local arm. The system also creates a centralized multi-user collaboration platform, which allows itself to maintain configuration, administration and deployment locally or remotely. Combined with its sustainable design, the system can make a company a consumer of its own byproducts. The company currently has more than 700 researchers in China. The average time they take to bring a new product to market is 18 to 24 months. The company's China operation employs 26,000 staff across 26 factories, eight logistics centers, three research and development offices, five branches and 40 regional offices. China is also the second-largest market for Schneider Electric and the largest market of industrial automation, ahead of the US. ""We've set a long-term goal to sell one-fourth of our products in the Chinese market and the rest to global markets. China's Belt and Road Initiative is encouraging us to deploy more resources in China and other related markets,"" said Ma. Schneider Electric's technology prowess flows from its investment (5 percent of its revenue) in R&D. For that, it has established five regional research centers worldwide: in France, the United States, China, India and Mexico, respectively. ""China's growing demand for high-value products, especially automobiles, and home-related services, offers many growth points,"" said Sun Fuquan, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Science and Technology for Development in Beijing. Chen Bin, executive vice-president of the China Machinery Industry Federation, said China is making progress on the path to becoming an advanced and competitive economy, but it will take time for the required changes to have an impact on industry. Patience and consistency will be required, as well as continuous reforms along the way, he said."
1,"Aviation companies have demonstrated their confidence in the Chinese market at the ongoing China International Import Expo, with Airbus looking to capitalize on opportunities in helicopter emergency medical services. In his keynote speech at CIIE's opening ceremony on Monday, President Xi Jinping said China's imports of goods are expected to exceed $30 trillion in the next 15 years, with imports of services tipped to top $10 trillion. The next day, a deal worth more than 10 billion yuan ($1.44 billion) was signed between China Eastern Airlines, which is based in Shanghai, and British engineering giant Rolls-Royce for Trent XWB jet engines and longterm maintenance services. Ben Story, Rolls-Royce's strategic marketing director, said the agreement involves China Eastern's 20 Airbus A350 XWB aircraft and is part of more than $2 billion worth of contracts, agreements and memorandums of understanding signed between Rolls-Royce and major Chinese airlines at CIIE. The company expects to sign more than a dozen deals with multiple customers at the expo across all its business sectors, including civil aerospace and power systems. Story said CIIE is a sign of the growing maturity of China's economy as the country seeks to better balance imports and exports, along with recognition of its status as a key market, and a demonstration of its openness to trade. ""So there are really positive signs and symbols coming out of this,"" he said. ""In the longer term, it's such a good way to really build our presence here, to build our capability here, to build our relationships here."" China is Rolls-Royce's fastest-growing market and became its second-largest market after the United States last year, contributing 12 percent of the group's 15 billion pounds ($19.69 billion) global revenue. Its businesses in China cover the civil aerospace, marine, power systems and civil nuclear sectors. ""I want China to be one of the key pillars of the whole organization, where we find some of the best talent, best capabilities for the whole organization's benefit. ... it's a good chance it will become our largest market,"" Story said. George Xu, CEO of Airbus China, said: ""The expo gives the international community a sense of China's solid efforts to open its market and share opportunities. At a time of rising protectionism, China's sincerity is unmistakable."" Airbus is looking to maintain its position as the market leader for helicopters in China. ""China used to be seen as the world's factory, but now it is seen as the world's market,"" Marie-Agnes Veve, head of Airbus Helicopters in China, said at CIIE. ""It's a fast-growing market, and as such we see lots of opportunities here. Although we have been in China for 50 years and are currently the leader in the helicopter market, we want to continue to be the main actor here in the years to come."" Veve said 85 operators in China fly Airbus helicopters for utility missions in the oil and gas, agriculture and transportation industries. In contrast, there are hardly any operators in the helicopter emergency medical services segment. ""There are only two HEMS operators for a country as huge as China,"" she said. ""This just shows how much potential there is in this particular market. We have already got HEMS helicopters in Beijing and are now starting in Qingdao (in Shandong province). We want to equip all the Chinese cities."""

0,"Taking up art for a livelihood is more than just striking a brush on canvas. Lin Qi reports.  A degree from an art college does not always mean that you embark upon a path to become a successful artist. Ins d, it simply means that you have entered a very competitive arena, and that you have to survive a rather high rejection rate.  ""A lot of people will quit in the first five years after college, when they cannot support themselves, or they can find no support from outside,"" says Wang Meichen, 34.  She graduated with a master's degree in oil painting from Tsinghua University's arts and design academy in June.  ""I told my mom that I would concentrate so much on painting that I may not have time to have children. She is OK with it because I have a sister who is married.  ""Many talented girls get married and give up art after having a child. I feel sorry for them,"" says Wang.  ""Once you stop it is unlikely you will restart.""  Her wish to be a painter is so strong that Wang gave up a job as a product designer three years ago. She felt that the work was becoming routine.      Then, when she enrolled at Tsinghua she found she was not well prepared for the new environment.  ""Many of my postgraduate classmates had studied oil painting before,"" says Wang.  ""I felt huge pressure, so for the first year I did not paint at all but tried to carve out a niche that could create a clear path for my future.""  She adopted an abstract approach. And for the remaining two years she says she painted from morning until 11 pm, almost every day.  Many students of painting now incorporate installation and mixed media into their creations, making their work eye-catching.  Wang says she is not against the trend but is more fascinated with painting and the challenge it brings.  ""Skills and vibrant colors don't necessarily make a great piece.  ""It is what an artist wants to express that really matters, even though sometimes he or she is not understood by others.  ""And that is the best thing I've learned at Tsinghua.""An artist's confidence, however, needs to pass the viewers' test.  The first test for art graduates these days is the graduation exhibition.  Over the last decade, leading fine arts colleges like Wang's alma mater and the Central Academy of Fine Arts in   have turned graduation exhibitions into a carnival for dealers, critics, collectors and ordinary viewers.  Wang says viewers wait in long lines to see the graduation shows, and their taste is both international and diverse.  She feels that more people now accept abstract art than they did a decade ago.  ""They don't ask questions like 'What exactly did you paint'. They say, 'I like your paintings. They look great'.""  She says the average price for oil paintings at the show, set by the school, was 20,000 yuan ($2,900) per square meter.  She sold three abstract works at the show and so did many students from the painting department.  ""It was a little surprising and a good start for me.""  She says many buyers were from furnishing companies and fancy clubs, who were scouting for artworks for decoration.  ""The prices are not a problem for them. They want works that are both decorative and worth collecting. Some of them have studied art.""  Young artists rarely face survival issues today since they start to sell their work at school. But they face great difficulty finding a good studio in a city center.  ""The cheap places are in the suburbs, and they cost at least 100,000 yuan a year,"" says Wang. ""Then, we also have to pay for paints and other material. For now, I will share a studio with my classmates.""  But selling one or two paintings is far from enough for young artists.  To launch a career, they need dealers and art institutions that can provide long-term support, including curating solo shows, cataloging output and exhibiting works at fairs.  Wang has been contacted by several institutions. But she fears that they have no intention of helping plan a career for her. They only want to sell her works, to see how the market receives them.  ""I have dozens of my paintings. But I don't want to sell them right now. I want to save them for my first solo exhibition. They are like my children. They deserve a decent presentation.""Galleries also hunt for artists with potential to progress.  Zhang Qiao from the Asia Art Center in Beijing's 798 art district says they don't work with an artist because he or she is young or old, but they do a check of an artist's output to see whether he or she is an independent thinker.  Xia Jifeng, the director of Hive Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing, frequents graduation shows. His institution has a project that stages the first exhibition of an artist still at school or someone who has just graduated.  He says they rule out those who create market-oriented works.  ""We see if the graduate is developing a systematic series of works. If not, it is not the time to exhibit him or her. We wait and we are cautious.""  So, teachers and gallerists urge graduates to first focus on creativity rather than on market recognition.  Cai Wanlin, the director of Beijing's Rhythm Art Organization, says many artists' fame is transient because their initial success is built on sales and they lack a solid base of collectors and academic recognition.  Ding Ning, a lithograph professor from the Central Academy of Fine Arts, says: ""It is good for an artist if he or she spends three to five years developing individual  s, before he or she comes to the market.""Some graduates see employment as a more secure choice than being a professional artist.  Chen Yujing, 24, a fresh graduate from the CAFA, plans to work as a comics artist at a web company in Beijing.  Her graduation work is a thread-bound colored picture book in which she re-creates in a vivid wuxia (Chinese action figures) storytelling style from her childhood - how a naughty girl escapes her mother's punishment. The hilarious scenarios made the book a hit at CAFA's graduation exhibition held in June.  But she is not confident of making a career as a picture-book artist.  She says this is because people do not take picture books as a serious form of art.  ""Most people think picture books are educational and only for children. And some mistake comic books for picture books.  ""But I will keep creating picture books in my spare time.""  Meanwhile, Wang says she does not regret not attending a graduate school, and she says she is thankful for her previous work experience.  ""My teachers say it makes my works more mature and that it will benefit me.""  She says her goal is to find a serious art institution in five years. And she believes that because of the intense competition, young artists need to promote themselves.  ""You can't sit at home waiting for opportunity to knock on your door. It's meaningless if your work get noticed by the world only after you die."""

It is the fourth time this year the ship docked at Kaohsiung Port, during which time it loaded up on supplies and made crew changes. The ship sets sail for Australia on Thursday, it said. The vessel belongs to the Office of Naval Research, and it can be used to conduct oceanic surveys for the US Navy. The ship is operated and maintained by the University of Washington, the island's media reported. In late September, the US State Department approved the sale of spare parts worth $330 million to Taiwan for F-16 fighters, C-130 cargo planes and other aircraft. Beijing has strongly protested the sale and urged Washington to immediately withdraw the deal and cease military contacts with Taiwan to avoid more damage to Sino-US relations and stability across the Straits. ""The arms sales to Taiwan have seriously violated the one-China principle, interfered with the country's domestic affairs and harmed Chinese sovereignty and security interests, as well as Sino-US relations,"" the Ministry of National Defense said in a statement on Sept 25. ""Those who rely on foreigners to build themselves up and undermine the peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits will certainly pay a price for their deeds,"" An Fengshan, another spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office, said earlier."
1,"Shanghai-based culture startup Art Revolver launched a pilot project over the weekend to help mass-market Chinese consumers access ""affordable and stress-busting art"" using the sharing economy concept. The try-before-you-buy business model will seek to ride China's ongoing consumption upgrade, and is expected to transform the domestic art scene eventually, creating a market worth hundreds of millions of dollars, said Eric Reithler-Barros, CEO of Art Revolver. He said the firm will provide rental art on a subscription basis. It will curate, deliver and install artwork to match the customer's environment and budget, and then periodically rotate the artwork with something new to keep the space fresh. ""Everyone, not just art connoisseurs, can now incorporate transient reminders of beauty and color into their hectic daily lives."" The firm will adapt the West's wine club model and supply ""many forms of hangable"" artwork - paintings, photographs, lithographs, posters, mixed-media pieces, machine-generated art, and calligraphy - to the consumer's doorstep. It will seek to integrate sharing economy, augmented reality, art education, e-commerce, and digital payments. A subscription will entitle the consumer to receive curation and contextual information from experts, to select art from e-catalogues and try out online using AR, and see how existing ambient space - bedroom, living room, washroom, staircase, workspace, store, lounge, hospital ward, atrium, waiting area, dormitory, and so on - would look after it is installed. Upon placing the order, art piece (s) will be installed at the specified location. Consumers can try out different pieces without worrying about selections, as they can change art at regular intervals throughout the subscription period. They can also buy the art they like. Citing global management consultant McKinsey's estimates of consumption, Reithler-Barros said the sharing art economy in major Chinese cities could be worth around $435 million annually, or a fraction of the $175 billion that Chinese households spend annually on ""recreation and culture services"". ""In China, galleries are crowded, art exhibitions are opening to long queues. The younger generation are enrolling into fine arts courses overseas. China has replaced the UK as the world's No 2 art market after the US,"" he said. Art Revolver will offer four-tiered pricing that will cater to a wide range of consumers spanning high net worth individuals to young professionals living in small flats and university students living in hostels. The market is huge because ""every empty wall"" in metropolitan China is a target, he said. Guangzhou, Guangdong province-based Jiali Zhang, founder of L1ng Network & Production, a communications agency, said: ""Sharing art could prove to be fun and fashionable. But I won't pay a lot for this service. Compared to my parents, we the millennial generation have more purchasing power and more taste, and are picky, so a good selection of artists, not necessarily big-name artists, and artworks, will persuade me to spend more on art, because wall posters of music stars, sporting icons, landscapes or mean machines can get boring after a while. An app that allows me to replace them with changeable art would be welcome."" But Yasser, an Indian student at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, disagreed. ""I'm not an art lover, so it's unlikely I'll use online art-sharing services. I'm not sure if they would really be affordable or prove an extra expense. I might still consider subscribing to them though if the concept catches on, or if any particular art piece really impresses me."" Reithler-Barros said tech-driven art business will have enormous implications for artists, curators, and consumers in China, a land that has consumed artwork since the Yangshao culture (5000-3000 BC). Logistics, insurance, and legal firms specializing in intellectual property rights, will likely also benefit from the sharing art economy, he said. The sharing economy will give wings to art that may be gathering dust in Chinese artists' studios, art galleries, exhibitions, and museums for want of viewers or buyers. Just as most artists are not good at marketing their own works, consumers are not well-informed about art or ignorant about how it could activate higher brain regions associated with a fulfilling life. Some people do not know how to buy art either. Art Revolver will seek to bridge artists, experts and consumers, Reithler-Barros said. Philipp Grefer, founder of Wise, an international festival that brings together influencers from the fields of culture, business, science and technology, said: ""We invited Art Revolver to make a presentation at our festival in Beijing recently because it promises to make art affordable to everyone. It integrates the sharing economy with consuming art, combining a creative business with the startup mentality of the tech world."" Veteran Chinese artist Ren Jian, who exhibited his latest works at Beijing's 798 Art Zone two weeks ago, said: ""Tech-based popularization of art is timely, and will provide a big push to traditional Chinese art. With online access, the artist can now hope every idea will find a viewer or a buyer. The artist will no longer have to struggle to reach the recipient's wallet, and will be free to focus on his art, thus improving its quality and enriching society."" Danae Li, sales manager at the Ullens Center for Contemporary Arts in Beijing agreed. ""In China, art education is offered only in primary schools. Adults haven't had much opportunity to experience and appreciate art, unlike in Europe and the US. ""Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou have been hosting big art exhibitions of late. This is generating a lot of interest among ordinary people, and creating opportunities for art exchanges. Art is part of people's spiritual needs, which are pursued as soon as material needs are fulfilled."" Reithler-Barros said: ""We expect investors to back more art-world startups in China, especially those that are tech-driven and propose new modes of consuming art. As for us, we'll start with a broad base of artwork on offer, from Chinese traditional to contemporary to modern to impressionist, in various mediums."""
0,"Liangjiahe village, a community of 120 homes scattered along a dry riverbed on the Loess Plateau in Yan'an, Northwest China's Shaanxi province, looks no different from the other valley hamlets in the region, except for the visitors lined up waiting to board electric minibuses to visit its cave dwellings and crofts.  From 1969 to 1975, President Xi Jinping lived and worked in the village as an educated youth during the ""cultural revolution"" (1966-76) when he was ages 16 to 23.  It was in this village that Xi, who heads the Communist Party of China, joined the world's largest political party, which has more than 89 million members.  In 1974, he was elected Party chief of the village committee - the start of his public career - and he was still a resident when he was recommended as a suitable candidate to become a student at Tsinghua University in Beijing.  Last year, Liangjiahe received 900,000 visitors, and the number is expected to hit 1.3 million this year. That's about 3,600 people a day on average. Unlike conventional tourists, some of the visitors are sent in groups by their employers, while others are clad in Red Army uniforms and armed with notebooks and pens, jotting down the things that interest them.  The village is small, and the usual tourist itinerary follows a settled order along a meandering mountain path: the village museum, a farm, a blacksmith's shop, a biogas digester, a well, a grinder powered by a diesel generator, a grocery store and the cave dwellings.  Apart from the museum and the cave dwellings, the other items are regarded as the heritage left by Xi in the 1970s, and most still function well today.  Xi, who learned about biogas technology in Mianyang in Southwest China's Sichuan province during a government-led campaign, built the biogas digester with other educated youths and the villagers. He also led local farmers in laying five strips of farmland in the riverbed, as the river, which was once wide, narrowed to a channel, albeit still sufficient to irrigate the land.  The small stream was the only source of water in Liangjiahe. But the water was sandy. To solve the problem, Xi led the villagers in digging a well. Many seniors remember how he was the first person to jump into the hole, and how he worked the longest shifts in the numbing mixture of ice, water and mud. It was a dangerous job because the well could collapse at any time during the excavation process.  Before the grocery store opened, it took hours for Liangjiahe's farmers to travel to the shop in Wen'anyi, a nearby town, to buy necessities. Xi suggested that the village committee should buy daily goods from the shop in Wen'anyi and sell them to the villagers in Liangjiahe at the price at which they had been purchased, saving them a lot of time.  Xi also exchanged a motorcycle he had been given by the county government as a reward for his performance for the diesel generator and grinder to help the villagers.  Liang Yuqian, 62, a blacksmith who made farm implements during Xi's time, still runs the same workshop, which opened in 1974 after Xi invited him to move from his home village nearby to work in Liangjiahe.  ""At first I just wanted to move from village to village. But Xi persuaded me to stay. He talked about his plan cordially with me, saying my plan would bring more personal profit, but that working in one place would mean I served more people,"" he recalled.  When Xi revisited Liangjiahe in February 2015, he recognized Liang immediately and greeted him with the words ""Are you still doing the job?""  Liang Yuming, 75, who Xi replaced as village committee Party chief in 1974, said the heritage items represent just a small part of Xi's contribution to Liangjiahe because he also did many other things, such as teaching the villagers to read and write, along with history and geography. He also soothed relations between families.  Liang Yuming said Xi was the youngest of the six educated youths from Beijing who were assigned to Liangjiahe - Xi was age 16 when Liang Yuming met him for the first time in January 1969 - and he was the one who most loved reading books.  He recalled Xi's two suitcases were the heaviest because they were filled with books.  ""When the farmers, who were used to hard outdoor labor, helped to carry the young men's luggage they said Xi's suitcases were too heavy and it was a wonder that a 16-year-old could carry them all the way from Beijing on the three-day journey to the remote valley,"" he said.  Lei Pingsheng, who was Xi's roommate and is now a senior researcher at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, said Xi's passion for knowledge was impressive. ""When we woke up late at night, we often found him still reading carefully in the dim light of an oil lamp surrounded by darkness and quiet.""  Xi likes reading about history, politics, economics, philosophy and literature, and comparing notes with people who share the same interests, according to Lei.  ""The educated youths shared their books. For most of us, learning seemed to be a part of life, undisturbed by the political movement swirling in our faraway hometown of Beijing,"" he added.  What made Xi different from the other bookworm educated youths was that he was always ready to put what he had learned into practice to serve the people.  ""Since his youth, it has been Xi's unswerving belief to undertake practical work for the people,"" said Tao Haisu, an educated youth from Beijing who was in the same county as Xi and often communicated with him about history and literature.  One time, Xi encouraged a difficult villager, who was often fiercely criticized for being a thief, to sing his favorite folk song to the villagers who were preparing to criticize him at a meeting. The man sang well and with great emotion, moving many of his potential critics. From then on, he was a changed man and was accepted by his neighbors.  ""Although Xi is five years younger than me, he reads more books and is knowledgeable in more fields than me,"" Tao said. ""He is honest and trustworthy.""  Many people believe that the hard life he led in Liangjiahe played an important role in preparing Xi's resolve to serve the people.  Wang Yansheng, another educated youth from Beijing who was also Xi's roommate at Liangjiahe, said: ""Xi is honest in admitting he was unsure about the future when he first arrived at Liangjiahe. Everybody has a process of development. No man is great when he is born.""  Wang vividly recalls the ""four difficulties"", as Xi noted, that affected every newcomer to Liangjiahe: fleas, shortage of food, hard work and uncertain thoughts.  Lei said they were shocked by the poverty of the region when they first arrived in Yan'an, which was known as ""a holy land of revolution"", as the Party's main organs had stayed and developed there for eight years.  ""Some people slapped the roof of the truck's cab and asked the driver if he was lost,"" Lei said.  After Spring Festival in January or February, the village was almost empty, because most of the farmers left to live as beggars and try to alleviate the lack of food during spring, according to Zhang Weipang, 70, a villager and good friend of Xi's at the time.  ""The hand-to-mouth life of the farmers prompted Xi's sympathy and motivated him to strive for a better life for the people,"" Zhang said.  The tourist boom in the village thanks to Xi's ""heritage"" has brought great convenience to the local people.  Xi never complained about the harsh conditions at Liangjiahe. He chose to put up with them and made up his mind to change them, according to the villagers.  ""Xi's tolerance of hardship was beyond my expectation. He just took things as they came. When he worked on the farm, he was like a professional farmer,"" said Liu Jinlian, a 67-year-old villager.  For the first two months after their arrival, Xi and the five other educated youths lived in a cave dwelling in Liu's home. Xi visited the family during his 2015 visit, and inquired in detail about every family member and their living conditions.  Lei said an important reason for Xi's love of, and gratitude to, the people at an early age was his family education. Xi told him that the farmers were the fathers and mothers of the Red Army, and were it not for their selfless sacrifice China's revolution would not have succeeded.  According to Lei, Xi became more experienced, patient and confident after he visited his father Xi Zhongxun, a former vice-premier who was wrongly investigated, between 1970 and 1972.  After that, Xi decided to live and work as a ""common farmer"", regarding himself as a part of the ""yellow earth"", Lei said.  Xi met a beggar who said he used to be one of Xi's father's guards. After the beggar related the names of Xi's family members and a few other details, Xi not only gave him all the money he had that day, but also gave his coat to the old man, Lei said.  During his 2015 visit to the village, Xi's biggest concern was still the people's livelihoods, according to local resident Zhang Weipang.  ""He asked me whether I often ate meat and what I planted. As before, his questions were always down-to-earth and concerned the specifics of people's lives,"" he said.  The villagers in Liangjiahe have written to Xi four times since 2007 to tell him about the latest developments. Xi replied to their letters every time, expressing his nostalgia - he calls Liangjiahe his ""spiritual home"" - and sending his best wishes for the village's development.  According to Gong Baoxiong, village committee chief, the village set up a tourism company in 2015, creating enough jobs for the farmers to work at home. Since 2007, the village has had a new road, internet, running water, electricity and most modern facilities. The main sources of income are tourism, root crops, apples, vinegar and pickled vegetables.  Gong, in his late 30s, said: ""President Xi said he 'secured the first button of his life well' at Liangjiahe. That provides motivation for all young civil servants to integrate serving the people with their careers and also their lives.""  ""He asked me which family I came from,"" said Gong, as he recalled his chat with Xi during the visit two years ago. ""When I said my father's name, President Xi smiled and said 'I know him. He is an honest man.'""  Contact the writers at liyang@chinadaily.com.cn"

0,"A total of 30 thangka paintings from top Nepalese artists are on display in Beijing, as part of efforts to promote cultural exchanges between China and Nepal. Thangka is a Buddhist scroll painting on cotton or silk. The art has more than 1,300 years of history and typically depicts Buddhist deities. Such paintings use mineral and organic pigments derived from coral, pearl, agate, sapphire, gold and other materials, so that the color stays vibrant for centuries, which makes them invaluable both in artistic and commercial terms. Thangka is an important art form in Nepal, and also plays an important role among the Tibetan ethnic group, as both share the Buddhist culture. The Belt and Road Initiative: Nepal Thangka Art Exhibition is co-organized by Art Kathmandu, an art gallery in Nepal, and the China Nepal Cultural Exchange Center. The exhibition is open to the public through May 5. ""Nepal and China are connected by geography, history and culture. The historically rich cultural relations between the two countries have evolved over thousands of years. Buddhism is one of the bridges which linked Nepal and China, since time immemorial,"" said Harishchandra Ghimire, minister counselor from the Embassy of Nepal in Beijing, at the opening ceremony earlier this month. Lumbini in southern Nepal is the birthplace of Shakyamuni Buddha. China also has many sacred Buddhist sites, such as the Wutai and Putuo mountains. Besides the economic benefits, such cultural exchanges can help bring people from different countries closer, says Zhang Shubin, director of the Nepal Study Center at Hebei University of Economics and Business. The exhibition is a good warmup activity for the ongoing second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, he adds. The exhibits show the life of Buddha from birth to the attainment of nirvana and the images of different Buddhist deities. For example, one painting shows how Shakyamuni was born from the armpit of his mother and how seven lotuses generated from his seven footprints. In another painting, Manjusri, an avatar of the Buddha who represents transcendent wisdom, is depicted. He is said to have shaped Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, with his sword. The painting with the thousand-hands and thousand-eyes Guanyin, or Avalokitesvara bodhisattva, shows the ability to see all suffering on Earth and give blessings to more people, according to Bhusan Kayastha, a research scientist at the National Astronomical Observatories of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing and CEO of Art Kathmandu, a co-organizer of the exhibition. ""Each deity has their unique iconography. Some look fierce, with red or blue-colored skin, or by holding a weapon, but that only serves to show their power and ability to fight the devil and protect people,"" he says. ""Thangka paintings are a beautiful art form. You don't have to be a Buddhist to admire them,"" he says. ""They can help calm you down when you are tired or angry."" There are also silk fans from Suzhou, Jiangsu province, on display, upon which Buddhist patterns are painted by Nepalese artists. ""These fans represent the true spirit of the China-Nepal cultural exchange,"" he adds. Wei Jiahui, 19, a college student in Beijing, says he was happy to visit the exhibition and learn about a different culture. He says the show for him was ""a good chance to acquire some new knowledge"" about Buddhism."
0,"With the Winter Olympics high on China's sports agenda through 2022, a vice-president of the International Olympic Committee urged the country to use its momentum to boost winter sports participation.  As China revs up its preparations for competing at the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics and hosting the Beijing edition of the Games in 2022, Juan Antonio Samaranch, son of former IOC chief Juan Antonio Samaranch, encouraged the Chinese public to embrace the opportunity to watch, learn and play winter sports more.  ""You will have the best winter sports action in the world at your doorstep... so you have to take advantage of that,"" Samaranch said in Beijing on Saturday.  ""Winter is here, so go out and select which winter sports you like the most. Tomorrow is Sunday. No class. Go and have it! It's a lot of fun!""  Samaranch made the remarks during the 2017 Beijing Winter Olympics Forum held at Renmin University of China, where IOC representatives, Beijing 2022 organizers and scholars discussed education and promotion of winter sports in China.  The 2018 Winter Olympics will be held in Pyeongchang, South Korea, from Feb 9 to 25. The next edition of the quadrennial event after that takes place in Beijing in February 2022. Beijing will become the first city in the world to host both the Summer (2008) and Winter Olympics.  With the Winter Olympics being staged in a neighboring country and then at home back-to-back, China has been pulling out all the stops to raise the profile of winter sports from niche to mainstream status.  With funding from the government and private sector, it plans to build 650 skating rinks and 800 ski resorts by 2022, laying the foundation for 300 million people to be involved in winter sports by 2022 and for businesses to generate aggregate revenues of 1 trillion yuan ($151 billion) by 2025 from spending at venues, and on equipment production and training fees. However, reality suggests that more should be done to fulfill the ambition.  According to a survey released at the forum on Saturday, only about 12 percent of the Chinese public regularly participates in winter sports, and only 8 percent routinely watch winter sports competitions.  The survey, conducted by the Humanistic Olympic Studies Center affiliated with Renmin University, was based on interviews with 12,000 respondents.  The survey also found that 58 percent of the public has never tried any form of winter sport due to the lack of facilities and knowledge.  ""Real interest from the public in winter sports needs to be further cultivated to maintain attention on them,"" said Li Shuwang, executive director of the research center.  According to the Beijing Municipal Education Commission, the city selected 52 schools in the fall semester for a pilot program to offer winter sports training at local rinks and resorts as part of a national plan to expand a similar program to 2,000 schools by 2022.  With public passion for winter sports fueled by upgrades to facilities and services, Guo Dandan, a retired freestyle skier, doesn't expect a repeat of the embarrassing moment that she experienced after winning the country's first world title in freestyle aerials in Australia in 1997.  ""After I won the championship, the award ceremony was postponed to borrow a Chinese national flag from the embassy, as the organizers didn't expect a Chinese skier would win,"" said Guo, who retired in 2001. ""Now with our country becoming a rising winter sports power, the future is much brighter."""
0,"Beijing South Railway Station cleared crowds of passengers on Monday by opening 28 windows to refund tickets that couldn't be used because of a suspension of services, the station authority said. Twenty-three high-speed trains departing from Beijing South were halted - most of them bound for Shanghai - including the earliest (which was scheduled to leave at 7:35 am) and the latest (scheduled for 5:45 pm), the station said. Some colored steel plates, which had blown down in a strong wind, cut power lines near the railway and severed part of the Langfang-Beijing section on the direct Beijing-Shanghai route, the Beijing Railway Bureau said. A high-speed G40 train traveling from Hangzhou to Beijing was halted near Langfang, Hebei province, at 11:04 pm on Sunday, when the mishap occurred, the bureau said. Several subsequent trains were then delayed until the wee hours - about 4 am - when the problem was corrected. That morning around 7, a second breakdown occurred on the same line. Railway departments launched an emergency response as services were again suspended. As of 10 am on Monday, the trains were gradually returning to normal. But thousands of passengers were held at the station. Zhang Bo, 42, an engineer traveling from Beijing to Wuxi, planned to leave Beijing South at 2:45 pm but had to wait nearly two hours. ""I didn't know what happened before I arrived at the station,"" he said. ""An hour has passed and I am still waiting for the station's broadcast announcement."" Glenn Richards, a technical manager from Australia, who was traveling in China, said his tour group encountered the delayed train service after a short stay in Beijing and was heading to South China. The 42-year-old said he had only been waiting about 30 minutes and thought it was just a normal technical problem. ""We're just waiting for the tour guide to tell us what's going on,"" he said. During the summer travel rush, Beijing South handles an average of about 154,000 passengers a day. From July 1 to Aug 31, the station is expected to see 9.53 million travelers. The station increased the number of refund ticket windows from the usual two to 28 to help the stranded tourists, who were given full refunds. Shang Zihan, who was supposed to leave Beijing in the morning but decided to refund his tickets in the afternoon, said it's understandable that a device can malfunction. He changed his original plan and got a refund for his ticket. ""It's good that I can get my full ticket price back,"" he said. Within 30 days, passengers who were stranded can take their paper tickets to a ticket office for a refund. No additional fees will be charged, the station said."
1,"Beijing's new international airport, which will start test operations in October 2019, announced public bidding for some of the food shops and retail outlets in its terminals is now open, according to a report by Beijing Youth Daily. The airport, having reserved an area of more than 18,000 square meters for building four themed dining areas including more than 90 shops, opened an area of 3,074 sq m for this round of bidding. As the high price of airport dining has been a topic of concern in recent years, the airport requires enterprises participating in the bidding to sign a letter of commitment to ensure restaurants in the airport will offer food of the same quality, with the same price as what outposts with the same brand offer in the city. According to the announcement, catering enterprises participating in the bidding should have had their business licenses registered no later than April 1, 2016. They should also have effective food licenses or port health licenses, and only operate within the scope of the licenses. In addition, enterprises also need to submit a compliance commitment letter to promise it has no major violations of law, economic litigation or arbitration over the past two years. The new airport, located on the border between southern Daxing district in Beijing and Langfang, a city in Hebei province, has terminal buildings covering an area of 313,000 sq m. Designed to take pressure off the overcrowded Beijing Capital International Airport, it will have four runways and accommodate 620,000 flights per year, according to Xinhua."
1,"China UnionPay now has its eyes on public transportation, with its mobile payment service launching in the sector in 20 cities in less than five months, according to a report by Securities Times. The domestic payment service provider and Guangzhou Metro made a joint announcement Tuesday that passengers can use Apple Pay with UnionPay's QuickPass service to directly pass through all subway stations' fare gates in Guangzhou, capital city of Guangdong province, the first of its kind in China. QuickPass is UnionPay's ""tap and go"" application that allows users to complete transactions by scanning QR UnionPay codes or placing their smart mobile devices near the card slots or the near-field communication technology (NFC) reading areas of compatible point-of-sale (POS) terminals. Last week, the service became available in buses, subways, high-speed trains and various kinds of bike-sharing platforms in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province. It has also been used in the intelligent bus projects in Guangdong's Zhaoqin city and Fujian's Longyan city. Passengers can pay the bus fare by UnionPay chip cards, all kind of smartphones' mobile payment solutions with QuickPass or scanning UnionPay QR codes. Public transportation, having a large user group, high frequency of use and position information, is one of the best industries where companies can attract users and collect data, Yu Baicheng, an analyst at wdzj.com said, Beijing Business Today reported. It is expected to become a fierce battle where UnionPay and the third-party payment giants collide.  AliPay's QR code-scanning payment has marched into the public transportation systems of 16 cities including Shanghai, Shenzhen, Hangzhou and Zhengzhou, enabling buying subway tickets and topping up fare cards. WeChat Pay also has launched QR code-scanning payment in six cities' public transportation systems. In Beijing, JDPay, the online payment service of e-commerce giant JD Group, has joined hands with Yitongxing, the official online payment platform for Beijing Subway, to launch QR code-scanning payment, Beijing Business Today reported. However, mobile payment platforms such as WeChat Pay and AliPay still started relatively late in this field, as public transportation systems have already had their own payment companies, Wang Pengbo, an analyst at Analysys, said, according to the report. ""The outside payment companies have to negotiate with the public transportation systems if they want a share,"" Wang said. For UnionPay, the achievement of tapping into 20 cities in less than five months shows its strength in offline payment market, an industry insider told to Beijing Business Today. The payment service provider has built a foundation that it had launched its bank card payment that includes electronic cash in the transportation systems of more than 300 cities late last year."
1,"CAIRO - Egypt's participation in the first China International Import Expo (CIIE) is a very important opportunity to increase Egyptian exports to the Chinese market, said Shirin al-Shorbagi, head of Egypt's Export Development Authority. The CIIE will be held from Nov 5-10 in Shanghai, a world famous financial hub and one of the most populous cities in China. ""The CIIE is very important for Egypt which will participate with a 250-square-meter national pavilion ... Thirty-eight Egyptian companies will participate in a 450-square-meter pavilion,"" Shorbagi said in an exclusive interview with Xinhua. So far, it is estimated that over 150,000 buyers from home and abroad will attend the expo. Apart from business exhibitions, 80 countries and three international organizations have confirmed their participation in the country-pavilion exhibition, which covers a total area of 30,000 square meters. The Egyptian official said the participation is politically and economically important, adding that the national pavilion will include the Ministries of Investment, Tourism, Planning, Trade and Industry, and the Suez Canal Authority. ""The national pavilion will highlight the new projects in Egypt,"" she said. She explained that 22 of the Egyptian companies that will participate in the CIIE operate in the agricultural sector, while the rest of the companies work in the sectors of engineering, medicines, garments and handicrafts. ""Exports to China are very limited compared with the imports ... China is a large country with a very large population and the exhibition is an opportunity to increase our exports to China,"" she said. Shorbagi noted that trade balance is in favor of China, stressing that it is a very good opportunity for Egypt as China moves to adjust trade balance with different countries. She revealed that Egypt's imports from China in 2017 amounted to about eight billion U.S. dollars, while exports stood at about 281 million dollars. According to the Egyptian official, imports from the beginning of 2018 till August hit 6.2 billion dollars, while the exports during the same period reached 256 million dollars. ""The exhibition is a good start to go to China with our companies to explore the needs of the Chinese market,"" she pointed out. Shorbagi said that during the exhibition, there will be several meetings between Chinese and Egyptian officials through Egyptian Commercial Representation Office in Shanghai and Beijing, adding that there is also a full program for both Egyptian companies and other enterprises to meet together. ""The national pavilion at the expo is an important opportunity to see Egypt with a new perspective through the recent economic reforms that have taken place, which help investors come to Egypt,"" Shorbagi reiterated. Commenting on the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative, Shorbagi said it helps strengthen the Eyptian-Chinese ties. ""The initiative strengthens economic relations between Egypt and China,"" she noted. ""Egypt is an economic partner of China and also a tourism partner ... Chinese are very interested in Egyptian civilization and tourism."" ""China's economic experience is unique,"" she said, expressing her strong respect for the Chinese people who are ""characterized by seriousness and strong will."""
0,"BEIJING -- Beijing has cleared the mud in a suburban river that cuts through the park that will host the international horticultural exhibition in 2019, the municipal government said Tuesday. The project, which started in June, has excavated 631,100 cubic meters of mud from a 12-km section of the Guihe River in Yanqing district in northern Beijing. The mud-clearing is part of ongoing efforts to improve the river's ecology. The government plans to grow reeds and lotuses in the river and build a wooden walkway for tourists in 2018. Beijing was awarded the host role by the Paris-headquartered Bureau International des Expositions (BIE) for the 2019 Horticultural Expo with the theme ""Live Green, Live Better."" Nearly 70 countries and international organizations worldwide have been confirmed to participate, the organizing committee said last month."
0,"Beijing’s first air class-action lawsuit related to pollution began an open hearing session at the city’s No 4 People’s Court on Tuesday. The defendant in the case is Duocai Lianyi Co, a steel and paint operation in Daxing district. Prosecutors say Duocai has been polluting the air and has failed to install devices to reduce emissions in accordance with regulations. “The company has harmed the surrounding environment,” prosecutors said during the trial. “We filed the lawsuit to seek a court order for it to halt emissions, and we are seeking compensation for the pollution it has caused as well as a public apology.” Lawyers for Duocai said the company had already halted emissions after receiving an order to do so from the district environmental authority as well as paid 200,000 yuan ($31,435) in fines. They added that the company would enhance pollution controls further if a new environmental evaluation leads to such a recommendation. The verdict will be announced at a later date, the court said, without providing a more specific time frame. Under the Civil Procedure Law revised last year, prosecutors have the power to initiate class-action lawsuits against enterprises that damage the public interest, such as those polluting the environment or compromising food safety."
0,"Beijing is strictly scrutinizing school canteens, food vendors and restaurants close to schools to secure a safer environment for students and teachers in the autumn semester, according to the city's food and drug authority. The monthlong program, launched by the Beijing Food and Drug Administration, started on Monday and will conclude on Sept 28. The administration said it will perform random examinations of the 2,000-plus school canteens and catering companies that offer food to schools, as well as nearby food retailers, during the project. The inspections of food preparation units are intended to crack down on poor quality food and eliminate potential safety hazards, according to the administration. Sanitary conditions in kitchens and canteens, disinfection of tableware and storage of cold dishes will be stressed. The inspections will also cover the disposal of food waste. Duan Zhiyong, the administration's director of catering service supervision, said food safety for students is the priority. ""More inspections will be carried out in school canteens and nearby shops while illegal activities that may pose a danger to student's health will be harshly punished,"" Duan said. The inspections are a positive response to its ""sunshine catering project"" initiated by the Beijing government in 2017 to enhance food safety by requiring restaurants and canteens to publicize food processing information, and to build an evaluation system for the public. More than 20,000 catering services in Beijing, including canteens in kindergartens, middle schools, high schools and restaurants, had been included in the sunshine project by the end of 2017. Duan said that about 70 percent of catering companies have been covered by the project so far, and the administration aims to reach 80 percent of food service providers in 2019. chengsi@chinadaily.com.cn"
1,"BEIJING - China said on Thursday that unilateralism and trade protectionism will inevitably harm others without benefiting oneself as the global economy is deeply integrated. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying made the remarks when asked to comment on a US Federal Reserve report released Wednesday. According to the report, known as the beige book, businesses in much of the US reported significant price increases for steel and aluminum products, because of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. It also said that firms in multiple sectors, including manufacturing and transportation, expressed concern about the tariffs' impact. Hua quoted a report from the Brookings Institution saying the US-China trade war will result in the loss of more than 2.1 million jobs in 2,700 US counties. In March, 107 Republican members of congress signed a letter urging President Donald Trump not to go through his tariff plan. In the letter, the lawmakers wrote: ""we urge you to reconsider the idea of broad tariffs to avoid unintended negative consequences to the US economy and its workers."" At a working lunch with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Wednesday, Trump said the word ""reciprocal"" will be the primary word that the US is going to be using. ""China, as an example, when they send a car to us, it's 2.5 percent tax. When we send a car to them, number one, they don't take it, and number two, it's 25 percent tax,"" Trump said. When asked to comment on Trump's remarks, Hua retorted with facts: First, the US charges 2.5 percent tariff on imported cars but 25 percent on imported trucks; Second, China has set a maximum tariff of 25 percent for whole vehicles, but only 10 percent for auto parts; Third, most of the American cars sold to China are produced by the subsidiaries of the US automobile companies in China. Hua said General Motors(GM) sold about 4 million cars in China in 2017, and Cadillac has sold more cars in China than in the United States. ""It should be said that American auto companies have enjoyed a huge dividend in China,"" said Hua. On the other hand, the US exported more than 280,000 vehicles to China in 2017, while China exported only 53,000 vehicles to the US, said Hua, noting that it makes no sense to compare the import tax rates for whole vehicles of China and the US. With regard to ""reciprocal"", Hua said as far as tariffs are concerned, the WTO does not have the principle of tariff reciprocity and WTO members also have different levels of tariffs. Reciprocity and fairness can not speak for themselves, so standards can not be formulated according to one's own interests and needs, she said. ""Instead, we must rely on equal consultations to formulate unified international rules and standards and we must all respect them,"" said Hua. To trade under coercion is by no means reciprocal and fair, she said, warning that self-righteous action may end up with suffering the consequences. When answering a question about whether China's recent opening-up initiatives in the automobile industry are in response to US pressure, Hua said China will advance reform and opening-up in accordance with the established goals and pace. She said China's full liberalization of manufacturing industry is a clear indication of its opposition to trade and investment protectionism. China supports the extensive and in-depth development of economic globalization and supports Chinese and foreign enterprises in achieving common development on a level playing field, she said. ""We welcome all countries to share the opportunities of China's opening-up and development,"" said Hua. She noted that whoever engages in protectionism against China means that he has closed the door to China."

The show was inspired by the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem and Chinese ancient city walls, both symbolizing solidarity in each culture. The artistic representation of the two typical cultural images resonated well with viewers from both cultures. In August the drama made its debut at the 2017 New Dance International Arts Festival in Beijing and in September. It was performed at the 4th Silk Road International Arts Festival in Xi'an, capital of Northwest China's Shaanxi province, attracting glowing reviews from Chinese artists and audiences. This year, at the invitation of the Israeli side, the   dancers took the show on the road to some of Israel's major cities, including Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.

Legendary Chinese dancer-choreographer Chen Ailian is showing no signs of slowing down even as she approaches 80. Over Sept 14-16, she did three nights of performances to celebrate her career spanning 65 years. She played the role of Lin Daiyu, a teenage heroine in the dance drama A Dream of Red Mansions, which is based on a novel of the same title written by Cao Xueqin during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). Chen, who was born in Shanghai and grew up in an orphanage, started to study traditional Chinese dance in Beijing in 1952. The same year, she watched a performance by the late Russian ballerina Galina Ulanova in Beijing.,After the Beijing Dance Academy was founded in 1954, Chen was transferred to study there. Chen is among the first dancers trained after the founding of the People's Republic of China and one of the most influential dance masters in the world. Since 1957, she has starred in the ballets Fish Beauty, White-Haired Girl and Farewell My Concubine. A Dream of Red Mansions is her favorite and the ballet premiered in 1981, combining traditional Chinese dance with Western ballet and modern dance. The Chinese classic has been staged more than 600 times in a span of 36 years. In addition, Chen is still an outstanding dance educator. In 1989, she founded her art group Ailian Troupe. And in 1995, she founded the Ailian Dance School."
0,"In the past decade, a nonprofit organization has been trying to reverse an imbalance in the quality of education provided in urban and rural areas. Since 2008, Teach for China has been sending graduate volunteers from some of the country's top universities to teach in remote villages and address a shortage of talented teachers. The program is now beginning to reap real rewards. When He Liu arrived at the middle school in Dazhai village, Yunnan province, seven years ago, the local children had never heard of Beethoven, Chopin or other composers, and often looked confused when their new teacher played a nocturne in class or showed them DVDs of The Phantom of the Opera. For the students, anything from outside their isolated village was entirely unknown, and therefore hard to comprehend. ""But as they listened to more songs and watched more movies, I saw signs that they were enjoying themselves. Some would nod their heads to the music and pretend they were conducting,"" said the 29-year-old graduate of Beijing Normal University, recalling the change in his former students. After graduating in 2010, He traveled to the mountainous region to work as a history teacher. He discovered that most of the teachers in the village had graduated from vocational schools and could teach little more than the contents of textbooks. ""In addition, the parents, who had been farmers all their lives, or worked in big cities and left their children in the care of their grandparents, could only provide limited knowledge. Those factors were taking a toll on the students,"" he said. Feng Qingli, who was head teacher during He's time in the village, said the isolated location hampers the children's progress. ""Nearly all of them work hard, but the problem is that they have limited contact with the outside world, so their vision is narrow,"" he said. Zhang Yue, one of He's former students, followed in her old teacher's footsteps and studied in Beijing, attending Beihang University. She said He had helped to broaden her horizons and was a lasting influence on her life. ""When I was young, the village seemed to be the entire world to me. It was Mr. He who made me realize that our village is so small and that I could go out and see the world if I worked hard,"" she said. According to Teach for China, about 1,000 fresh graduates from China's top universities joined its program in the period between 2008 and 2016. In 2006, about 470 classes involved with the program nationwide saw average marks rise, and more than 420 registered a surge in the number of students who regularly scored more than 80 percent in exams. Since the reform and opening-up policy started in the late 1970s, China's economy has grown to become the second-largest in the world. However, the downside is that the country's rapid rate of urbanization has widened the urban-rural divide, and the gulf in the education sector is one of the most worrying problems, according to experts.,  Wang Liwei, a researcher at the 21st Century Education Research Institute, a nonprofit organization in Beijing that focuses on education policy research and advocacy, said the quality of rural education is significant because a high proportion of the population still lives in the countryside. ""Poor education in isolated areas compromises the quality of the rural workforce, and that could hamper the country's development. People whose low educational status makes them unemployable also pose a threat to social stability,"" she said. In the past decade, the government has spent ever-increasing sums on upgrading the infrastructure of rural schools, providing better buildings and facilities, and introducing preferential policies to attract skilled teachers to isolated areas. In 2007, the State Council, China's Cabinet, implemented the Free Normal Education Program in six ""normal"" universities, which are colleges that train teachers for all levels. Students admitted to the program are exempt from tuition fees and also receive a monthly allowance of 600 yuan ($90) while on campus. Following graduation, they spend a specified period teaching in regions where teachers are in short supply. In 2010, the National Training Program for Primary and Secondary School Teachers was implemented jointly by the ministries of education and finance. Under the program, village teachers in Central and West China were given the opportunity to take free refresher courses or attend short-term training sessions at top universities at the State's expense. In 2012, central government spending on education reached 2.7 trillion yuan, surpassing 4 percent of national GDP for the first time, according to the Ministry of Education. The figure has been rising ever since, and last year it hit 3.8 trillion yuan, accounting for 5.2 percent of GDP. The increased investment means rural students no longer have to worry about crumbling school buildings, while internet access and multimedia teaching facilities are now commonplace. ""If you take a tour of the countryside now, it's amazing to see that schools are always the fanciest buildings,"" Andrea Pasinetti, founder and CEO of Teach for China, said. However, according to Wang, the researcher, despite the improved infrastructure, some rural areas are still experiencing severe shortages of skilled teachers. ""The lack of talented teachers means the better-off parents send their children to schools in nearby townships and big cities, but, in return, the loss of students exacerbates the problem of teacher shortages because they also gravitate toward larger towns. It's a vicious circle."",  Pasinetti, a US-Italian dual national, founded Teach for China in 2008, basing the organization on the model of Teach for America. Its Chinese name is Meili Zhongguo, meaning ""Beautiful China"". Unlike other education assistance programs, Teach for China does not advocate a one-way street, whereby teachers become permanent fixtures in isolated spots. Instead, it emphasizes the mutual benefits the two-year program offers both teachers and students. Liu Pengze, director of the Beijing Lead Future Foundation, an NGO that provides most of the funding for Teach for China, said volunteer teaching programs are not a new phenomenon in China, which has seen the Hope Project and other initiatives, but nearly all of them advocate a lifelong devotion to teaching at the grassroots level. ""The unequal access to quality education is a result of urbanization, therefore it's unfair to expect these young talents to travel to unappealing, isolated villages and teach in them for the rest of their lives,"" he said. Before they enter the classroom, each graduate on the Teach for China program undertakes a training course that lasts four to six weeks. The course provides introductions to teaching methods, management skills and local customs, and helps the students to hone their skills through multiple trial lectures. During training they a given a monthly stipend of 2,200 yuan, but once they are in the field, they receive 2,800 yuan a month. According to Passinetti, although the financial rewards are low, the graduates benefit greatly from the experience. ""Few employers would leave demanding tasks to new employees and let them assume huge responsibility, but in rural primary schools, our graduates are like the CEOs of each class,"" he said. He Liu, the teacher, said his experience in Dazhai helped to formulate a pattern of thinking which he has retained: ""The teaching process is objective-oriented and requires a clear plan. It molded my thought pattern, which I apply to my everyday tasks."" Statistics supplied by Teach for China show that the graduates become more willing to stay in the education sector as they progress through the two-year program. ""Initially, only about 6 or 7 percent say they will stay in education after their placement, but the number rises to 70 percent when they finish the program,"" Liu said. According to the NGO, more than 50 percent of its graduate volunteers either stay in the sector after finishing their teaching stints, or they join nonprofit organizations similar to Teach for China. Now, the Beijing Lead Future Foundation is pushing forward another program called Meili Xiaoxue, or ""Beautiful Primary School"", to offer opportunities to previous graduate volunteers who want to contribute further. The schools enlisted in the Meili Xiaoxue program remain under the administration of the local education authorities, but they hand over their management to the foundation and teaching duties to Teach for China. ""Now we have two such schools in place and they are just like two laboratories. What we want to do is to explore a new approach for rural education, which can be copied in other parts of China,"" Pasinetti said. Contact the writer at lilei@chinadaily.com.cn"

They include the United States, Australia and the Republic of Korea. ""The new policy extends the visa-free stay for travelers who want to visit the three regions, allowing foreigners sufficient time for a short visit for travel, business meetings or visiting friends and family. It will boost the tourism industry,"" said Zhu Lei, deputy head of Beijing's port of entry office. Beijing and Tianjin previously allowed a 72-hour visafree stay. The 72-hour stay has been allowed by Beijing since 2013.,""The number of foreigners eligible for the free-visa policy has increased gradually,"" Zhu said. ""The policy has been praised by international travelers. But based on a survey, about 40 percent of international travelers said 72 hours is insufficient for them to enjoy the city of Beijing, and they wished to extend their stay,"" Zhu said. In 2016, the 72-hour stay in Beijing was used on 26,323 passenger trips, an increase of 32 percent from 2015. Ports of entry are also extended to designated international railway ports, seaports and airports, said Ji Lixia, deputy general head of the Beijing General Station of Exit and Entry Frontier Inspection. Travelers can arrive using six entry points, two in each jurisdiction: Beijing Capital International Airport and Beijing West Railway Station in the capital, Tianjin Binhai International Airport and Tianjin International Cruise Home Port in Tianjin, and Shijiazhuang Zhengding International Airport and Qinhuangdao seaport in Hebei province. Previously, the policy applied only at airports. ""The diversification of ports for entry is convenient for international travelers to choose suitable transportation based on their travel plans,"" Ji said. The Beijing airport has started a new policy to help travelers. ""The airport can keep luggage for those travelers for 144 hours for free,"" said Meng Xianwei, general manager of the aviation business department of the airport.

0,"When Italian sculptor Dionisio Cimarelli arrived in Beijing via the trans-Siberian train at the age of 21, he might have been one of the first foreign artists to visit China after it was opened to the outside world in the mid-1970s. ""That was a very incredible trip, and I spent four months traveling and gathering information for my college thesis in China,"" said Cimarelli in his studio at the Art Students League of New York, where he teaches sculpture. ""At that time, it was very unusual to visit China－not many people went there."" Following the path of Matteo Ricci, the Italian adventurer who is believed to be the first Jesuit missionary to set foot in Beijing's Forbidden City in 1601, Cimarelli didn't finish his journey in China after his short visit in 1986. He went back in 2004 and that time stayed for 10 years. ""When I went back to China in 2004, I was very fascinated by the changes in China,"" Cimarelli said, adding that in those days China was a relatively poor country that was coming out of difficult economic and cultural times. He recalled that in the mid-1980s, China had not yet fully opened to international travelers and it was difficult for foreign scholars like him to obtain a visitor's visa longer than two weeks. China was still a developing country with many people living under the poverty level. Before China's reform and opening-up in 1978, people needed an invitation or work permit approved by the government to travel to China, Cimarelli explained. Asked about the biggest changes he observed over the past three decades, Cimarelli laughed. ""The changes are incredible, too many, I don't know where to start,"" he said. In large cities like Shanghai and Beijing, the skyscrapers are everywhere, the improvements to China's infrastructure are unbelievable, and there are many more cars and traffic now. ""The change is everything, especially the people. When I went to China the first time, people they were dressing in green and blue, and now Chinese people are dressing like anyone else in the world, very fashionable."" In terms of art, China has also changed a lot, he said. Back in the 1980s, China's artists were largely influenced by the Soviet art. However, when he went back in 2004 he was excited to see that Chinese artists were starting to interact and exchange with artists from different countries around the world and galleries were full of Western art.,In his own art, Cimarelli said he tried to combine aesthetic elements of Chinese culture with his Western techniques. In 2010, at the invitation of the Italian government, Cimarelli spent more than six months creating a five-foot-tall (1.5 meters) bronze sculpture of Matteo Ricci for the Italy Pavilion at the Shanghai World Expo. ""I've been inspired by the story of Matteo Ricci since I went to China for the first time,"" Cimarelli said. ""And Matteo Ricci was coming from the same region as me, a small city that is very close to where I was born, so the opportunity to make a sculpture of him was a great honor to me."" He said he used Western sculpture materials and techniques and added gilded Chinese calligraphy to the work. The characters are actually Cimarelli's name written in Chinese. ""When I was in Italy, I'd been working a lot with ceramics, and I always liked it a lot,"" he said. ""But when I went to China, I wanted to make something that represents Chinese culture, and when anybody thinks about China, they think about porcelains. ""So, I moved to Jingdezhen (a town in Jiangxi province famous for Chinese porcelain) and opened my own studio and worked there for a couple of years to make my series of porcelain sculptures. ""It was very difficult and challenging for me,"" added Cimarelli, who had experience in ceramics but knew nothing about Chinese porcelains at the time. ""It was totally different."" Since then, he has been making contemporary figurative sculptures in Chinese porcelain. His works include a standing child and a broken African mask, peppered with the gilded calligraphy of his name. Having witnessed the great changes that reform and opening-up have brought to China, Cimarelli is confident about the benefits the Belt and Road Initiative will bring to both Italy and China in the future. Italy once played an important role in the ancient Silk Road, and has had a long history of close cultural ties with China since the Middle Ages when Marco Polo (1254-1324) traveled there, he said. ""It's great for trade, as the Silk Road already was fantastic more than two thousand years ago,"" said Cimarelli. ""The exchange between different cultures is like a bridge between peoples. ""We learn from each other and exchange ideas－that is the attitude of Matteo Ricci when he visited China. He didn't go to China for teaching, but for learning."" Cimarelli said he had the same attitude when he visited China－to get exposed to a new culture, to learn from it, to exchange ideas, not to impose his own culture on Chinese people. ""China is like my second home country,"" Cimarelli said and showed off his Chinese by saying ""I love China"" in Mandarin. ""Of course I hope to go back to China in the future, anytime, I'm always looking for cooperation and exchange projects."""

As an icebreaker, a single can tip some money to a fellow love-hunter. The latter will get to know about the overtures in real time. Yang Xin, a love and marriage analyst from consultancy Analysys, was quoted in a media report as saying that ""singles tend to have few contacts, have little time to date offline and have doubts over the authenticity of online dating. ""The sharing economy model solves the problem of allocation of resources. The combination of online dating and sharing economy can help expand their circles of friends in an atmosphere of trust."" As Yihao grew in popularity, it caught the eye of investors. Angels have invested 7 million yuan so far. Xu Xiaoping, co-founder of Beijing-based fund ZhenFund, figures among the investors. Official data showed 130,000 users by September last year and more than 40,000 love-hunters－impressive strides over six months. I have tried the app myself and was surprised to find an array of CEOs and founders of leading companies among the users and love-hunters. They all have their own circles. For instance, Jack Ma, founder and CEO of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, has recommended 46 males and 21 females who work in his group to his Yihao circle. What's more, his leads helped form 30 couples, according to the analytics on his homepage. Not just individuals, even corporates like Huawei Technologies Co Ltd are joining Yihao to set up their own circles, where their single employees are introduced to each other. The other day, my friend told me excitedly that one of the couples she had helped pair up has decided to get married. ""Sharing is loving,"" she chirped."
1,"Alaska's seafood exporters are concerned about the impact new tariffs from China could have on their industry. After the US last week released a list of goods on which it will place 25 percent tariffs, China reciprocated on American goods, including Alaskan seafood. The tariffs will go into effect on July 6. The new 25 percent tariff would be on top of current ones that vary from 5 to 15 percent. Alaska exported 40,000 tons of salmon to China last year. Other Alaskan products on the list that appear to be impacted include geoduck, sea cucumber, frozen salmon, pollock, Pacific cod and sole. ""We are still waiting to gain more details — a full product list and product specific classifications. Initial indications are that products exported to China for reprocessing and re-export (to other countries) may be exempt from this new tariff,"" Alexa Tonkovich, executive director of the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute (ASMI), told China Daily. ""China is a major reprocessing center for Alaska seafood, so how these tariffs are applied has a major impact. Either way, many Alaska seafood products for domestic consumption in China would be subject to the new tariff,"" she said. ASMI has been promoting Alaskan seafood in China for more than 20 years. ""Alaska seafood companies have also invested in the market and have many Chinese partnerships,"" Tonkovich said. More than 10 major e-commerce platforms in China, including tmall.com, promote Alaska seafood during the commercial fishing season. Last year, in addition to salmon, king/snow crab, black cod, halibut, cod, sea cucumber and yellowfin sole, new products and deep-processed/ready-to-eat products such as pollock roe, pollock hamburger and nuggets were sold on tmall during the promotion. The sales were triple those during the non-promotion period and hit 90,000 kilograms. ""We are deeply disappointed in these retaliatory tariffs. There is no connection between the products targeted by the US and the tariffs Beijing plans to impose on exported American seafood,"" John Connelly, president of the National Fisheries Institute, said in a statement. ""It is Maine lobstermen, the men and women on boats in Alaska, and families harvesting and processing seafood in the Pacific Northwest who will feel the brunt of the Administration's misguided policy. It is not clear where these trade actions will ultimately lead; what is clear is that they will negatively impact American seafood jobs,"" he said. Based on the data from the McDowell Group for ASMI, more than 21,200 rural Alaska residents were directly employed by the industry in 2015. Major seafood processors that could be affected include Trident, Peter Pan, North Pacific and Alaska General. In March, Alaska Governor Bill Walker announced a major initiative to build on the economic relationship between Alaska and China and led a 12-day trade mission to China in May. Fifty representatives from 30 companies in Alaska, from sectors including fisheries, tourism and investment, had participated in business-to-government and business-to-business meetings, networking opportunities, events and market briefings to promote Alaskan business opportunities in China. Since 2011, China has been the top consumer of Alaskan goods. In 2017, Alaska exported $1.32 billion worth of goods, including $796.2 million in seafood and $64.6 million in fishmeal, employing thousands of fishermen in Alaska. The state also exported $355.8 million in mineral ore, $49 million in energy, and $48 million and $5.9 million in forest products and machinery, respectively. Jeff Welbourn, senior director of Trident Seafoods Corp's China office, told China Daily that his company, one of the largest seafood harvesters and processors in North America, is making its biggest investment since it was founded in 1973 in infrastructure to accommodate the Chinese market. ""Alaska has abundant resources, from natural gas and seafood to beer and baby food. These resources enable our state to dramatically reduce the trade deficit between the United States and China, if we can finalize agreements to increase exports of our products,"" Walker said Monday in a statement related to the tariffs. ""Trade negotiations between leaders from both countries are ongoing. I am confident that we will, in the end, embrace the opportunity for mutual economic growth that we can achieve by working together,"" he said."
1,"Its success underlines how the mobile internet technology is spawning a tide of innovation in China and how thousands of startups are scrambling to jump onto the bandwagon of digital economy.  According to global consulting firm CB Insights, China is now home to more than 50 unicorns - startups valued at more than $1 billion each - among 214 unicorns worldwide. The country has the largest number of unicorns outside the United States and Didi is ranked the second most valuable startup, after its rival Uber Technologies Inc.  Jonathan Woetzel, a director of the McKinsey Global Institute and lead author of the report ""China's digital economy: a leading global force"", said China has one of the most active digital-investment and startup ecosystems in the world.  ""Beyond scale, it is the enthusiasm for digital tools among China's consumers that will support growth, facilitate rapid adoption of innovation, and make Chinese digital players and their business models competitive,"" Woetzel said.  According to him, China's digital globalization is only just getting started but is gathering momentum, with local companies scrambling to venture out beyond their home-turf to search for opportunities.    One of such typical players is Didi. Sitting on an abundant cash reserve and powered by over 7,000 employees, the Beijing-based company is making stronger and faster moves on overseas expansion as well as business extension into next-generation technologies, including new energy vehicles and driverless cars.  When Didi acquired global ride-sharing giant Uber's China services a year ago, it secured absolute dominance in the Chinese market. As of now, more than 450 million users and 21 million drivers are using services from this on-demand mobility company.  And the fight is coming to the overseas markets where the company said it is confident of competing with Uber. It is stepping on the accelerator of global expansion, chiefly by partnering with a number of ride-hailing companies in foreign countries.  The company set up an international business department in February. Cheng Wei, founder and CEO of Didi, said: ""We are seeking to be the biggest operator of automobiles in the world.""  In August, Didi announced it would invest in Dubai-based ride-hailing platform Careem, a week after it announced cooperation with Estonia-based Taxify, as the company steps up its push into markets such as the Middle East, Africa and Europe.  It also allied with Japan's Soft-Bank to inject around $2 billion into its existing partner Grab, and cooperated with Brazil-based taxi on-demand service 99, Uber's major US competitor Lyft, global car-rental firm Avis Budget Group, and India's ride-hailing company Ola.  Most of these platforms are fierce competitors of Uber in their respective regions. Building local partnerships with these influential local partners, which is a faster way than starting from scratch, has given a strong impetus to Didi's global presence.  Zhang Xu, an independent smart-transportation analyst, said whether Didi can take on Uber in overseas markets will depend on how quickly it can integrate its resources with its foreign partners.  ""So far, Didi's ties with them have been capital-oriented, but deeper collaboration can be expected on technologies, products and services,"" he added.  On top of tapping into international markets, Didi is also actively promoting the application of new-energy vehicles. It has formed a joint venture with the Global Energy Interconnection Development and Cooperation Organization earlier this year to roll out charging networks for electric vehicles, or EVs.  The move came after the Beijing-based startup signed up with National Electric Vehicle Sweden AB, which bought the assets of bankrupt Saab Automobile AB in 2012, to jointly develop EVs.  According to the International Energy Agency, also known as IEA, more than 750,000 EVs were sold worldwide last year, compared to 547,220 sold in 2015. China has surpassed the US to be the largest carrier of electric vehicles, accounting for 40 percent of the EVs sold in the world, twice as big as the US.  ""The future of transport is new energy vehicles, and ride-sharing will be a key link in promoting new energy on the road,"" said Cheng. ""With the advance of new energy and new transmission technology, we have the chance to build a global 'internet' of energy.""  Apart from EVs, Didi is ratcheting up resources into artificial intelligence, as self-driving vehicles are widely seen as the next frontier of innovation.  In November, the company announced the opening of its main US research facility in Mountain View, California, to facilitate the growth and expansion of its Bay Area-based team. The new campus is located in the heart of Mountain View on National Avenue, with offices covering 36,000 square feet and capacity for more than 200 employees.  This is part of the Didi Labs, a laboratory unveiled in March this year. Bob Zhang, CTO of Didi Chuxing, said at the campus opening: ""It's been an exciting year for Didi Labs. Our talented team is growing fast and making important contributions across our key tech areas, from smart-city transportation management, AI ride-matching, to security and new product innovation.""  Having hands in an array of transportation services, including taxi, premier cars, mini bus, car rental, hitch and investments in bike-sharing, Didi's latest push in self-driving cars highlights once again its ambitions of building a one-stop platform to meet people's various demands.  ""We are seeing a great revolution which integrates the internet of information, the internet of energy, and the internet of transportation. Didi hopes to play an important part in promoting such integration so as to make cities better,"" Cheng added."

1,"KIGALI - Visiting Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Rwandan counterpart, Paul Kagame, agreed here Monday to further promote bilateral cooperation in a bid to bring more benefits to the Chinese, Rwandan and African people. In their talks, the two leaders also spoke highly of the growth of bilateral ties over the past 47 years since their countries established diplomatic relations. Xi recalled his meeting with Kagame in Beijing in March 2017, during which they reached extensive consensus on promoting bilateral relations and friendly cooperation and brought China-Rwanda ties to a fast track of development. Beijing is willing to work with Kigali to translate their traditional friendship into concrete benefits for the two countries and the two peoples, and open a new chapter in their friendly cooperative relations, Xi said. China and Rwanda, Xi stressed, should view their ties from a strategic height and long-term perspective, firmly support each other independently choosing their own development paths, and keep mutual understanding and support on issues related to each other's core interests and major concerns.,Xi called on the two countries to strengthen the link between their respective development strategies, give full play to their complementary advantages, and carry out pragmatic cooperation in more areas and at deeper levels. China welcomes Rwanda's participation in the international cooperation within the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative, and encourages more Chinese investment in Rwanda to help advance the African country's industrialization and modernization, Xi said. Xi asked the two sides to strengthen people-to-people exchanges, so as to bring closer the hearts of the two peoples and consolidate the social and public support for the future development of their friendship. The two sides, he suggested, also need to deepen law enforcement and security cooperation, maintain close coordination on international and regional issues, and strengthen collaboration on issues of global significance, so as to safeguard the common interests of African countries and developing countries. Over the past several decades, China-Africa relations have always been defined by sincere friendship, unity and cooperation, Xi noted, pointing out that the two sides have become a community with a shared future going through thick and thin together as well as a community with shared interests dedicated to win-win cooperation.,Strengthening unity and cooperation with African countries is an important foundation for China's foreign policy and a long-term steadfast strategic choice of Beijing, Xi said. He compared Africa to a galloping lion, saying that China is glad to see a stronger Africa that is increasingly integrated. Calling the African Union (AU) a banner guiding African countries to solidarity and cooperation, Xi said China always supports the AU playing a leading role in promoting peace and development of Africa and playing a bigger role in regional and global affairs. China, he added, is willing to elevate the strategic significance of its relationship with the AU, set it as an example and make it more effective, so as to bring more benefits to the Chinese and African people.,Kagame, for his part, called China a reliable friend who shares weal and woe with Africa. He said it is of great importance for Rwanda and Africa to develop friendly ties with China. He spoke highly of China's valuable assistance for Rwanda in such areas as infrastructure construction, agriculture and education, adding that China's helping hand has made positive contributions to his country's reconstruction and livelihood improvement. The Rwandan president also expressed his hope to strengthen exchanges with China on state governance and deepen win-win cooperation on bilateral as well as multilateral platforms. Rwanda is willing to enhance cooperation with China within the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative, which offers a significant opportunity for both Rwanda and Africa, Kagame said. As the AU's rotating chairman, Kagame stressed that China's long-standing firm support is of great value to Africa's development.,Africa places great importance on China's role in international affairs and is committed to further deepening their friendship and mutually beneficial cooperation, he added. The African side, he said, looks forward to attending the Beijing summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) in September, and stands ready to jointly push forward the development of FOCAC, so as to generate more benefits for the people of both sides.

The trip has already taken him to the United Arab Emirates and Senegal, and will also take him to South Africa for a state visit and the 10th BRICS summit, and to Mauritius during a stopover."
0,"BEIJING - An industry association in Beijing's hi-tech heartland Zhongguancun has launched a project to create more job opportunities for international students studying in China.  ""Cirrus Project""- Job Search (CPJS), launched by Zhongguancun the Belt and Road Industry Promotion Association (ZBRA), aims to attract foreign talent by offering internships and training with enterprises at Zhongguancun, said Zhang Xiaodong, director of ZBRA.  The association was founded by high-tech firms, research institutes and entrepreneurs in Zhongguancun park. It aims to push for international cooperation for companies in the park.  Under the CPJS, foreign students can seek internship opportunities with companies at Zhongguancun through outreach programs at university. Students with a good internship report will also be rewarded, said Zhang.  Now the CPJS has established contact with universities including the University of International Business and Economics, Beijing Institute of Technology and Renmin University of China.  ""This is my first time attending such programs,"" said Jeun Yeong, a South Korean student studying Japanese in Renmin University. He attended a CPJS job affair in his university on Friday.  ""I will graduate in a year, and I hope my Chinese, Japanese and Korean skills can help me find a good job here,"" Jeun said.  There are more than 7,000 high-tech companies in Zhongguancun Haidian science park, said Huang Ying, deputy director of the park, ""Many are in urgent need of international talent for their overseas expansion.""  The CPJS aims to reach more than 10,000 international students in five years and help more than 1,000 students establish close contact with local companies.  In January, China dropped the work experience requirement for foreign postgraduates and allows foreign students with a postgraduate degree or higher from Chinese universities to be employed within a year after graduation."
0,"It may be a well-worn cliche, but first impressions do matter, as much for places as they do for people.  Upon my recent return to the Chinese capital from a visit to London, I was thinking a lot about the first impressions that first-time foreign visitors must have of Beijing when they arrive.  Needless to say, they are no doubt impressed by the gleaming modernity of Beijing Capital International Airport, and in particular Terminal 3, which is world-class by any standard and can surely match any airport in any developed country.      Sadly, for most people, that illusion is likely to be dispelled the moment they pass through the automatic doors and seek a means of transport to go to the city, and are confronted by an array of taxi touts offering rides for ludicrous prices.  My latest return to Beijing took place in the early hours of the morning. Normally I would take advantage of the excellent bus service which links the airport with many areas of the city for a reasonable fare, in my case about 30 yuan ($4.40) for the trip back to China Daily.  As a long-term resident of Beijing, and having traveled from the airport more times than I can recall, I know the drill, and I know how much it really costs to take a taxi back into the city.  So you can imagine my sense of disbelief and shock when I asked an airport employee if there were still any buses running at that late hour.  Her swift reply was ""no, taxi is 350 yuan to go to the city"". Had I replied to her, I am afraid that it would have been unprintable in a family newspaper.  What was even more outrageous was that I could plainly see that the ticket office for buses into the city was still open (a limited night service was running), so what on earth was she talking about?  Anyway, I merely walked on, purchased my ticket and boarded the bus, which soon set off down the airport expressway to stops along the Third Ring Road.  It's one thing if a freelance taxi tout tells you some tall story about the transport situation, but when a uniformed employee of the capital city's airport spouts such nonsense, then serious questions ought to be asked of the authorities running Beijing's major international transport hub.  Such behavior is certain to tarnish the reputation of our city in the eyes of foreign visitors, it contradicts the authorities' efforts to build Beijing into a modern, world-class metropolis.  And my advice to any first-time travelers to Beijing is to avoid the taxis at the airport. It's easy to find the ticket office for the bus service, and in the daytime it offers a very comprehensive service for a very economical fare.

1,"This is the very first CIIE, and we are definitely not missing it. Denmark enjoys remarkable reputation in green development, design, health, among many other areas, and Danfoss is considered as a key contributor to Denmark's world renowned Green Growth Model. We are part of the Danish delegation to the expo this year. We are here to showcase our green brand image through presentations of our energy-efficiency solutions as well as our strong commitment to China market. We know that each province and autonomous region will organize delegations of officials and company representatives to visit and procure from the expo. Danfoss has established strong cooperation with Chinese cities. We enjoy excellent relationship with cities like Wuqing and Haiyan where we have substantial presence with continued investment and growth. We also have strong business relationship with cities such as Jinan, Baoding, Datong. We'd like to take this chance to meet with more cities and our potential business partners to let them know the values Danfoss is ready to deliver. With our proven solutions for urbanization, electrification, climate change, digitalization, as well as food supply and safety, Danfoss is well positioned to support China's development on national and local level. We enjoy a leading position in climate, energy, food and infrastructure. CIIE, with strong support from the Chinese top leadership, will be a unique platform to guarantee a more open environment for international participation in its economic growth by importing more latest technologies and ideas. This will bring in more competition and encourage innovation in all industries we are in. This in return will enable us to execute our ""Second Home Market"" strategy in a more consistent manner. CIIE is also a good indicator that China will accelerate its development by adopting western technologies in a faster pace. This gives us more confidence in China's economy. In reality, for instance, based on our experience in Denmark where heating consumption in buildings dropped by 50 percent in the past few decades with our proven technology, we will be able to help achieve the similar results much faster as China becomes more open with the right policy tool and implementation. Similarly in cooling, using our existing Turbocor technology, we can easily reduce energy in various applications by 30 percent. Danfoss has been benefiting from China's reform and opening-up policy. We have been on a continued growth journey in China, especially in recent years as China rolls out more opening-up policies and investing more on green growth by utilizing and importing the most innovative technologies both at home and internationally. In 2017, our sales in China grew by 30 percent, the strongest among all our regional markets, contributing one-third of the Group's overall growth. Our sales statistics show that the growth is directly driven by massive investments in the field of green and energy efficiency by the Chinese government to tackle the challenges of climate change and pollution. Danfoss believes further opening-up will be a propeller of China's continued growth, and a robust driver for the world economy. Meanwhile, it will bring stronger growth incentives for the businesses of Danfoss. In China's newly announced development plans, environment and energy efficiency have been elevated to national top priorities. We are confident that as China continues to reform and open up, more potential will be unleashed, and our growth will continue. China is our second-home market. Danfoss would like to share our best with China, not only to gain market share, but also to support China's development initiatives. The shift to focus more on quality and efficiency in the past few years has laid a solid foundation for the sustainable and stable growth of China's economy in the future. China's economy will continue to grow at current speed in years to come, and we are very optimistic about China's economy, and our future in China. Our business is in strong alignment with China's development initiatives. The actions China is taking are reinforcing our confidence. China is leading the world in IT and AI technologies, which is transforming how economy develops and how people live. We are watching closely and investing heavily in the areas to sharpen our edge. CIIE is a unique window to demonstrate China's continued openness to the world. We will look forward to China's next movement to take China's open up to the next level. Danfoss attaches special importance to CIIE. We look forward to participating in CIIE to raise our profile and visibility to our business partners and stakeholders far beyond expecting immediate profitability. The example mentioned happens to be one of the reasons we are joining the Danish Delegation to CIIE. Denmark is renowned in quality products, sustainable development, and hygge lifestyle. Members of the Danish delegations are all contributors. We're looking to this expo as a platform for our Chinese partners get a better picture about who we are, and what we can help them achieve.,Thermo Fisher has a 500-square-meter booth at the Medical Equipment & Health Care Products Hall, showcasing around 30 products serving different vertical industries like healthcare, pharma & bio-pharma, environment and food safety. We have established a quick testing station that provides a hands-on experience for visitors to experience how our products can enhance their life. There's also a virtual reality (VR) zone in the lab that enable visitors to access our advanced technology in real time. What we really show our partners, customers and the China market is that Thermo Fisher has capabilities in innovation, and we innovate ""in China for China"". We expect to sign around 10 Memorandum of Understanding during the expo on such areas as academia, pharma and biopharma, metal detection. We have a number of companies (mostly Chinese) that we are planning to attract in this expo. From organization perspective, we are looking forward to working with local government organizations, research institutes, universities, hospitals as well as companies. From industry perspective, we expect procures from our key-focused vertical markets including healthcare, food safety, environmental as well as pharma and bio-pharma. CIIE is a significant move for the Chinese government to actively open the Chinese market to the world. For Thermo Fisher, China is a critical market. Our priority in Chinese market is to help our customers to accelerate their innovation and to actualize the blueprint of ""Healthy China 2030"" by providing multiple solutions in precision medicine, environment and food safety, etc. At the same time, CIIE provides an open platform to better understand China market. With abundant industry resources, CIIE will definitely help us to better understand the local needs and ensure our innovative solutions and technologies work for China market. The reform and opening-up has created a huge market and enormous demand especially for industrial products. Thanks to the opening up, we have the opportunity to expand our footprint in China and become an organic part of China's economy. Today China is the second-largest country by revenue for Thermo Fisher, representing 10 percent of total global revenue in 2017 and achieving double-digit growth. We've been here for over 35 years. We are here to celebrate the opening of China that we believe as something that will create more opportunity for China market. For instance, our key industrial focus includes precision medicine, digital and biopharma which are all aligned with government's priorities. I remain optimistic about the economy, because as we engage closely with customers, we find that there is a real need to want to work with us and that is my gauge of whether we're going to be successful or we are not. And this is how the CIIE is a great forum for us to understand whether the companies actually see a need from us. I think China has many promising markets to focus on, such as healthcare, environment, pharma and bio-pharma they are all growing fast. And that tells me that the government is really investing in China for the long term, it's not a short-term strategy. I'm glad to see that our products and solutions are in align with them.,Omron brings world-leading factory automation technology and solutions to CIIE 2018.

We appreciate that the organizer is providing diverse coverage opportunities to exhibitors, which can enhance our impression in China. Also, we are impressed by the arrangement of comprehensive workshops and forums, which offer good opportunities for foreign companies to meet more potential Chinese partners. China Daily is one of the most important media outlets in China. Omron is honored to join this coverage and willing to provide more in-depth interview opportunities to you.,During the CIIE 2018, UPS has prepared informative sessions to share UPS’s know-how on custom brokerage and import management. Moreover, we will also showcase our services and leading technologies, featuring how UPS contributes to and facilitates the import businesses worldwide. Meanwhile, UPS has just rolled out the addition of several new stations to its intercontinental rail service connecting China and Europe, improving connectivity for businesses in both regions. UPS’s rail service presents a competitive solution – companies can save up to 65 percent in costs when compared with air freight, and benefit from time savings of nearly 40 percent when compared to traditional ocean movements. This UPS China-Europe rail service expansion will facilitate access to markets in both China and Europe for businesses located in major cities along Belt and Road route. We expect to promote more import trade flows by announcing this news coinciding with UPS’s participation at the first CIIE, a high-profile government-led event. CIIE 2018 provides UPS with a platform to share cross-border trade insights and best practices gained from working with customers in China over the past 30 years; it’s also an opportunity for us to get a better understanding of the current challenges facing Chinese businesses. We want to raise awareness of UPS’s import supply chain capabilities and strengths. As a partner to Asian businesses with intra-Asia and Europe shipping needs, across key industry segments such as retail, high-tech and industrial manufacturing/automobile. UPS reinforces its commitment to enabling global cross-border trade. Initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative and organization of the China International Import Expo (CIIE) are demonstrative of the Chinese government’s steadfast commitment toward greater integration with the global marketplace. The CIIE will continue to drive restructuring of the importing environment. It reveals the increasing demands for supply chain optimization and operation efficiency from customers in different sectors including retail, high-tech and industrial manufacturing/automobile. To this end, we’re offering a differentiated approach to solving our customers’ challenges through effective logistics solutions specific to these industries. We are feeling optimistic about the future logistics industry as we see great opportunities. While UPS has only been operating in China for 30 years, it’s important to note that the organization has been around for more than 110 years now; and we’re good at adapting to the changing demands economically, socially, environmentally and even culturally, across the 220 countries and territories we work and serve. As China continues to implement reforms and progresses toward greater market openness, the logistics industry is also transforming to meet the dynamic needs of Chinese businesses as they engage in more global trade. Logistics is the backbone of increased cross-border trade, and will bridge the gap between complex global value chains and new consumer pools. Being the advocate of free trade and globalization, UPS is looking forward to the opportunity to deliver tailored solutions and experience to Chinese businesses looking to increase their participation in global value chains. UPS is focused on expanding our geographical presence and improving the customer experience for businesses in the high-tech, automobile, industrial manufacturing and retail segments. In recent years, the Chinese government has proposed several initiatives to deepen China’s openness, and UPS is focused on expanding our geographical presence and improving the customer experience for businesses in the high-tech, manufacturing and retail segments. The development of the Chinese economy has kept great momentum for consecutive years. We can see some of the emerging trends of the China market, which will influence the economic development in regional and global markets. Transitioning from low-cost production to value-added manufacturing, China has made remarkable strides toward improving market access and developing the infrastructure needed to promote unimpeded trade with its economic partners since its reform and opening-up policy was introduced 40 years ago. By 2021, China will add $1.8 trillion in new consumption, roughly the size of Germany’s consumer economy and more than one-fourth of all consumption growth in major economies. Against a backdrop of the shifting industrial purchasing landscape and a rapidly growing middle-class, opportunities abound for businesses. We recognize the importance of strengthening the manufacturing base, but also know the critical role that services play in that regard. We know that you can’t make it, move it, buy it or sell it without services, including the vital express delivery, logistics and transportation services that drive commerce.,The Bayer exhibits at CIIE focus on health and nutrition, two very fundamental issues in all of our lives. We show some of our latest research results and development concepts in our Pharmaceuticals, Consumer Health, CropScience and Animal Health businesses. Our theme is ""Energize Your World"" which is very relevant for health and nutrition. In the area of Crop Science and Animal Health, we will highlight our efforts to shape agriculture by using breakthrough innovations that benefit not only farmers, but also consumers and our planet. Our exhibits will show some typical scenarios in the food chain, starting from sowing which is the start of our food chain, to managing crops, harvesting them and finally to the consumption of food. Our pharmaceuticals division has been making significant investments and progress in research and development, especially in the areas of cardiology, oncology, gynecology, hematology and ophthalmology. Our exhibition will showcase solutions in these therapeutic areas, including cancer. The CIIE is a signature event for the Chinese government that highlights and supports China's policy and aim of further opening up to the world. We expect to meet representatives of many diverse and exciting countries, companies, businesses and organizations with an interest in China, and look forward to exchanging ideas and finding opportunities for collaboration. Bayer is very committed to open innovation and collaboration, especially in the areas of health and nutrition. We welcome existing and potential customers, consumers, business partners and collaborators to visit our exhibition area and share their ideas with us. I believe our great exhibits will speak for themselves. They demonstrate the innovation, excellence and passion that drive Bayer's continuous efforts to meet the needs of Chinese patients, Chinese consumers, Chinese farmers and Chinese society. I believe that the CIIE can help to enhance development in the healthcare and agriculture industries by creating more awareness of the importance of nutrition and health, and promoting the solutions available to further improve lives in these areas. We support China's pledge to further open up its markets to foreign companies as we believe this will be a great opportunity, not only to bring innovative products and solutions to China that enhance the lives of Chinese people, but also to promote exchanges of ideas and collaboration, leading to better understanding and trust. All of this is crucial to supporting innovation, both in China and around the world. Further opening up by China will benefit all of Bayer's businesses in healthcare and agriculture by allowing us to bring even more of our innovative solutions to China with greater speed and efficiency. This will help us to engage in more collaborations in China, which will enable us to be even more connected with local business partners, government, consumers, patients and farmers. Through this, we can gain a better understanding of new trends and opportunities in China, explore new and exciting market segments and business models, as well as further develop our existing portfolio. Despite the various challenges facing China and also the world, the Chinese economy will continue to grow and develop towards the ""centenary goal"" that China has set itself of achieving a moderately prosperous, harmonious and balanced society in China by 2020. I expect that, in the next three years, China will focus on its 13th Five-Year plan and proceed with implementing its plans for higher quality economic growth, supporting innovation and sustainability as growth drivers, and going forward with its reform efforts, including supply-side structural reforms, reducing inventory, deleveraging debt, alleviating poverty. I believe China will also handle challenges with pragmatism and continued focus on its long-term objectives. Key issues that we will be watching for include the speed and scope of reforms, and the maintenance of quality growth and social stability while carrying out reforms. Innovation is another key issue of interest for Bayer as we firmly believe that local innovation, as well as allowing more innovative products into China.,At the first CIIE, We will exhibit a selection of Yara crop nutrition solutions, as we understand the increasing awareness and requirements on food safety and quality among Chinese consumers. Our fertilizers will help to grow healthier and better-quality crops, bringing more values and benefits to consumers. We will also showcase our advanced technologies and solutions on modern farming. Yara's aspiration is to be the leading provider of sustainable crop nutrition solutions, supporting farmer profitability through knowledge, quality and productivity. Our knowledge, solutions and technologies allow the farmer to increase yields, while securing sustainability and reducing the carbon footprint. Some of the techs and solutions have has been widely applied for more than 10 years in Europe, and we are committed to bring them to benefit the farmers in China as well. Our senior company executives will be attending this show and share their knowledge and insights with all visitors. CIIE is a great platform for Yara in various perspectives. During CIIE, we'll sign the cooperation agreement with Sinochem Group. We are pleased to further strengthen our partnership with Sinochem who is one of our long-term channel partners in China. Moreover, we expect to improve public awareness around the important connection between food safety and quality with modern farming and fertilizer. We'd love to continue sharing our knowledge and educate more farmers and users on our advanced technologies and global expertise on fertilizer. Participating in CIIE is of great value to our long-term development and success in China. It provides an open platform for communicating our brand and our mission here: fortifying a long-term commitment to the China market. We hope to leverage CIIE as an effective platform to influence our users, partners, and also the general public, providing them with a fundamental understanding on the connection between food safety and quality with fertilizer, and the values and benefits that Yara could bring to them. It is a platform for enhancing our corporate brand in China. Moreover, we are committed to helping China improve its modern farming by importing our world-class knowledge and technologies, and by establishing local partnerships. Innovation in the agriculture of the future lies in digital farming, the leading trend in advanced agriculture. Yara has been dedicating in scaling up digital farming world-wide for years and is now bringing our proven technology and solutions to China. Yara has, and I believe will continue, to both receive while deliver benefits to China's business environment. Since we entered the China market in 1913, Chinese farmers have actively embraced Yara's imported technologies and advanced concepts. Thanks to the open market, we have seized the opportunity to expand our presence among our Chinese customers. Riding the valuable opportunity of the open market in China, we have also established partnership with the state-owned enterprise, Sinochem Group, to launch the MAP (Modern Agriculture Platform), which will help us further develop modern farming in China with our digital farming initiatives. China has invested a lot in the development of agriculture with favorable policies for the fertilizer industry, such as agricultural subsidy programs and poverty reduction projects, which will obviously promote the development of agriculture. On our side, we will also promote our solutions to more farmers and enable them to flourish. I believe China's economy will continue in its prosperous development with increasingly more multinational cooperation on advanced technologies and concepts. As consumer demands grow for healthier food from quality crops, the market is set to give ample support to the trend of developing agriculture of high economic value. There is great potential to explore and achieve a win-win situation through in-depth cooperation with China's government authorities, as well as industry players. We understand that the country maintains high expectations for the balance between environmental protection and agricultural production. It has enacted policy to support this mutual development. And there is another opportunity for us – the consumption upgrade will enhance our ability to develop and import more innovative products and technologies. We are very honored to be invited to participate in the CIIE, and from what I know, it marks a major initiative from the Chinese government to demonstrate its firm support to liberalize trade and globalize economies. The CIIE is proof of its determination to open its market to the rest of the world. As the national English-language newspaper, China Daily is a voice of China on the global stage. It is a great platform for covering the CIIE's development and communicating its mission. Its coverage of the CIIE is diverse and well-rounded, including general news and important facts about the Expo to help the public understand more about its importance. In addition, it also covers the highlights from participants in different industries and countries.,Wacker highlights in CIIE include the ACEO? 3D printing with silicones which is the world's first silicone elastomer-based 3D printing technology, and the ultrathin precision silicone film that can be used as electroactive polymers for intelligent wearable products and industrial applications such as wave power generation. We will also display the world's first 3D printing process to use chewing gum which allows individually personalized gum in a wide range of colors, shapes and flavors. All these products and technologies are cutting-edge and were developed in recent years. Although we have introduced the 3D printing technology for silicones and chewing gum in China since 2016, this is the first time we present silicone 3D printing machine and the 3D printing machine for chewing gum in China. For silicone 3D printing, we are targeting to a wide variety of industries, such as automotive, aerospace and aviation, healthcare, equipment industry and mechanical engineering. For ultrathin precision silicone film, we not only expect to work with related manufacturer and institution in China, but also hope local manufacturing industry could leverage this novel material to develop more new applications in China. For 3D printing to use chewing gum, it is not only an innovation for fun, but can also meet the trend of individuation of the young generation. We think candy shop owners might like to have such machine in their shops. In addition, as our technology also allows manufacturers to add more natural ingredients, such as herbal extract, into formulation, it enables the new type of chewing gum to carry more functionality than before, which is also attractive to candy manufacturers. Yes, we believe the CIIE will further accelerate Chinese industry's transformation to high-end manufacturing, because the novel material and technology introduced at the show will enable innovation in a wide variety of industries. Meanwhile, leveraging the strength and resource of each region, the high quality and cost performance raw material from the global market also allow Chinese manufacturing industry to produce competitive products to win out in both the local and global market. CIIE demonstrates the Chinese government's firm support to the trade liberalization and economic globalization, and its determination of actively opening the market to the world. Therefore, we can continue to carry on our global production and global sourcing strategy, which means we can leverage the resources and benefits of the global market to supply our customers to the best of their interests. After 30-year rapid development, Chinese economy has reached a new height. The Chinese government has clearly realized that export is no longer the sole driving force for continuous growth. Increasing import is of great importance, in terms of both political and economic reasons. We are very encouraged by the new opening-up measures President Xi Jinping announced at the Boao Forum early this year. We are glad to hear that China will significantly expand market access and actively expand imports which will benefit globally-operated companies such as Wacker. The opening-up policy allows us to leverage the resources and benefits of the global market to supply our customers to the best of their interests. For example, we can continue to supply Chinese PV module producers with our high-quality polysilicon product produced in Germany. Meanwhile, strengthening intellectual property rights protection and a more transparent investment environment aligned with international standards reinsures us to further invest and develop in China. With the policy orientation and measures taken for industry upgrade, environmental protection and trade liberalization, as well as the increasingly open and transparent market, we believe China's economy will continue to growth in the next few years. That's also why we decide to increase investment in China. With 50 percent of our sales revenue in China generated by imported products and 20 percent of products produced in China export to overseas market, China is a market for both import and export to Wacker. Therefore, we attach great importance to trade liberalization related movements. Meanwhile, as a foreign invested company, we always appreciate an investment environment that is in line with international standard. We are pleased that the Chinese government has taken several measures to simplify investment process in recent years. Furthermore, as our products are widely used in products and applications that are needed in daily life, such as hair care products and medical supplies, we will be pleased to see more changes that could increase domestic consumption in China, for example, the recent individual income tax reform.,Sasol is honored to be showcased at the South Africa Pavilion exhibition hosted by the South African Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). As a leading global chemicals and energy company proudly rooted in our South African heritage, Sasol is privileged to demonstrate how we can play our part in enhancing collaboration and cooperation between China and South Africa through our business. When we received the invitation from the government of South Africa to participate in CIIE, w"

Creating things doesn't need a lot of people and it does not cost much either, she said. ""With a little bit of patience the participants can make unique products and nothing can replace the feeling of creating something by hand,"" Xiaobei said. As the spirit of craftsmanship takes hold, many people are confident about the development DIY market. Xiaobei plans to expand the scale of her workshop and package DIY courses so as to bring more happiness and satisfaction to more people."
1,"President Xi Jinping and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron marked the first completion of a European pressurized water reactor at a ceremony and witnessed the signing of 20 bilateral cooperative documents after their Tuesday talk in Beijing. The leaders, meeting at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, unveiled a plaque to mark completion of the EPR project, located at the Taishan nuclear power plant in Guangdong province. The project is a third-generation reactor and one of the most advanced in the world in terms of nuclear safety and performance. The project, which has taken eight years to complete, is the largest cooperative project on energy completed between the two nations as well as a great example of bilateral economic cooperation, said Nur Bekri, vice-chairman of China's National Development and Reform Commission and director of China's National Energy Administration. During his talk with Macron, Xi said that the two countries should deepen concerted efforts in their traditional fields of cooperation, including nuclear energy and aerospace. Beijing and Paris should also nurture new highlights for growth, such as agriculture, medical care and sustainable development, Xi said. Macron echoed Xi's call on reinforcing bilateral cooperation within the framework of building the Belt and Road, saying that such collaboration is of great strategic significance. Paris looks to boost communication and dialogue at a high level and in various fields during this visit, reinforce cooperation in key areas such as aerospace and nuclear power, and introduce a new chapter of bilateral cooperation, Macron said. As China will host the Winter Olympic Games in 2022 and Paris will host the 2024 Summer Games, Xi said the two countries should reinforce exchanges and cooperation in areas including tourism and youth. Macron is making his first state visit to China from Monday to Wednesday. It is also his first trip to the country since assuming office in May last year. The 20 deals signed by China and France on Tuesday covered areas such as nuclear power, aerospace and health. After their talk, Xi and Macron jointly met with delegates attending the first meeting of the France-China entrepreneurs' council. When addressing the business leaders, Xi reaffirmed China's opening-up policy as well as China's commitment to an open economy at a greater level. China is ready to uphold reciprocal opening-up with France and with Europe, and promote the strengthening of the global economic governance system. When jointly meeting the press, Xi said he and Macron agreed on reinforcing bilateral cooperation in the international context, jointly addressing global challenges including climate change and terrorism. On China-Europe ties, Xi said China firmly supports the integration of Europe and welcomes France's greater contribution to China-Europe ties. Macron said China enjoys great strength in artificial intelligence, and the two countries' cooperation on promising sectors will yield a positive influence."
1,"Chinese entrepreneurs brought 42 innovative business ideas, covering industries like new materials, energy and artificial intelligence, to a boot camp Tuesday in Beijing before they set out to pitch them Wednesday at Pitch@Palace, a global competition initiated by the Duke of York. They were getting one last training at the camp from a group of mentors consisting of industry leaders, technology experts and former   winners from other countries who shared their personal experiences and presentation advice. The day-long boot camp also included several lessons from different industry speakers. Hu Jianbiao, the well-known host of a popular Chinese debate show named Let's Talk, shared storytelling skills; Hanadi Jabado, an executive director of the entrepreneurship center at Cambridge University, showed how to make the most of this competition and leaders from KPMG offered guidance on tax issues for start-up companies. The Duke of York launched the boot camp at Peking University Tuesday morning with a speech. He said that this competition is ""done in China, for China and with China"" and he would like to help businesses here get access to the global market. ""There's a lot of value in understanding what other cultures do, so we're not only creating that added value to you as business, but also creating this connection that you need in order to be able to be successful,"" he added. Pitch@Palace was founded in 2014 with an aim to boost innovation and entrepreneurship around the world. It entered China last year and provided a platform for participants to meet with industrial leaders from both China and the UK and exchange business resources between the two countries. After several stages of reviews started earlier this year, the competition committee selected 42 final pitches on May 12. The entrepreneurs will need to give these pitches in a three-minute presentation at the semi-final tomorrow, where 12 of them will be selected to enter the final on Friday. The three prize winners also will get the opportunity to fly to the UK and represent China at the global final competition. Shuai Mei, chairman of AI-Robotics company, said this year's competition is seeing more pitches in artificial intelligence and is more international. She was the winner of last year’s competition and won second place at the global final for equipment that could help amputees walk again. ""The boot camp this year also was more practical and specific,"" Shuai added. ""We were divided in groups with different specializations, which is more targeted to a specific industry."" One of the entrepreneurs, Zhou Aixia from Beijing Deepwise Company, who is going to pitch big data medical treatment, said the group has learned many presentation skills, like how to grab an audience's attention and looks forward to the upcoming competition. ""We just want to communicate with more people in the same business and seek more potential partners for our future development. This is more important than winning a prize,"" she added."
1,"BEIJING - More than 1,800 companies have signed up for the second China International Import Expo (CIIE), scheduled for early November this year, the Ministry of Commerce has said. Over 900 companies from 77 countries and regions have confirmed participation as exhibitors, including 180 Fortune Global 500 firms and leading enterprises in various industries, Gao Feng, a spokesperson for the ministry, said at a press conference Thursday. The ministry will step up efforts to invite more private firms as well as small and medium-sized enterprises, Gao said. A total of 172 countries, regions and international organizations and more than 3,600 enterprises participated in the first CIIE, held from Nov 5-10 in Shanghai. It was the world's first import-themed national-level expo."
0,"While patriotic education is still considered highly important, some patriotic education centers, which aim to raise awareness through a range of activities, face problems.   Although they are crowded on special dates, some education centers receive very few visitors at other times.   One such example is the Li Dazhao Martyrs Cemetery in northwest Beijing, where Li, one of the founders of the Communist Party of China, is buried. It was listed as a national patriotic education center in 2001.   Guan Xiaolin, a security guard who has worked at the cemetery for three years, said that the record number of visitors, in his memory, was about 3,000, when a group of soldiers visited on a special day.   ""Apart from occasions like that, the place is extremely quiet for most of the year, just as you see now - there's not even a single visitor,"" he said.   Other centers are experiencing similar situations.   One example is the former residence of Soong Ching Ling, the honorary chairwoman of the People's Republic of China in the 20th century, located near Houhai Lake in Beijing's downtown.   It was Soong's home from 1963 to 1981, and is now a patriotic education center.   ""Mostly people come to visit on certain memorial days, such as National Day on Oct 1 and the anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, which falls on July 1. Most visitors come in groups rather than individuals,"" said a 65-year-old volunteer at the residence, who asked only to be identified by her surname, Gao.   She added that the visitors vary greatly in age, and most come in the name of social groups or Party committees from across the country.   ""But the number of individual visitors has risen a lot compared with years ago, thanks to the country's improved patriotic education in recent years and the official website of the residence, where visitors can access exhibition information,"" she said.   According to Beijing Daily, more than 200,000 visitors visited the residence last year, and the official website of the residence says it received an average of nearly 2,500 visitors a day during the seven-day National Day holiday last year.   In addition, some patriotic education centers fail to meet visitors' expectations because they lack diverse displays and exhibitions.   Tursongul Torgan, a primary school teacher from the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region in Northwest China, visited Soong's former residence soon after she arrived in Beijing with colleagues for a period of training in late September.   She said young people, especially children and teenagers, quickly become bored with exhibitions and listening to guides.   ""Based on my experience, most children around me don't enjoy just reading information boards. They prefer modern displays, which they find more interesting,"" she added.   Sun Lu, a teacher of Chinese at Hefei No 42 Middle School in East China's Anhui province, said many patriotic education centers still display the history in dull ways, and are failing to keep pace with the times.   ""Those centers should provide better services by utilizing modern technologies, such as VR glasses and 4-D films, which will not only attract the attention of teenagers, but also adults,"" she said.   Jiang Chenglong contributed to this story.    (China Daily 10/02/2017 page3)"

1,"BEIJING - China on Tuesday urged the United States to be more rational concerning the ongoing trade issue and to stop undermining the interests of others as well as itself. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang made the remarks at a daily press briefing in response to a question on US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's recent speech at the Detroit Economic Club. According to reports, Pompeo blamed China's economic and trade policy for the trade issue in his speech Monday and said the United States will respond to ""protect American property."" ""The spokesperson for the Ministry of Commerce has already declared China's solemn position on the economy and trade,"" said Geng, pointing out that the US has confused right and wrong and the purpose of the accusation is to disguise its unilateralism and protectionism policy. ""Treating the consensus reached by both sides with complete disregard, the United States has recently been back and forth and has finally ignited a trade war,"" said Geng, reiterating that this move not only decreases trust, but also undermines the interests of the Chinese and American people, the interests of companies of both countries and the interests of people all over the world. ""China does not want a trade war, but it does not fear one,"" said Geng, stressing China will continue to take effective measures to safeguard the interests of the nation and its people and firmly uphold economic globalization and the multilateral trading system. ""No matter how the external environment changes, China will follow the established rhythm, stick to the vision of development for the people, unwaveringly advance reform and opening up, promote high-quality economic development, and accelerate the development of a modern economy,"" Geng said."
0,"Beijing will ban the planting of female poplar trees in the future to prevent the mess of willow and poplar catkins - fuzzy reproductive tufts - that blow throughout the city every spring, creating problems for traffic, street cleaners and people with allergies. According to the Beijing municipal landscape and forestry bureau on Sunday, the city will upgrade existing species and increase the variety of trees used in urban greening projects. ""In addition to upgrading the current poplar trees, we have adopted many methods for limiting catkin production, including chemical injection, trimming and thinning,"" said Zhang Bo, researcher at the bureau's science and technology office. The city has organized a team with 100 professionals since 2017 to locate every female poplar tree within the Fifth Ring Road, he said. ""At present, the team has created a database of all the female poplar trees in the area, which provides strong data support for the catkin treatment,"" he said. The government will also start a citywide inspection of the fire risks that come with catkins. High-pressure water jets will be used to reduce floating catkins, and officials have asked the urban cleaning department to clear away the debris in a timely manner. As of the end of 2018, the city had about 284,000 female poplar trees within the Fifth Ring Road. Chaoyang district has around half the total, according to the bureau. Up to 60 percent of the poplar trees are growing well, and that means they produce catkins. Cao Xiaojia, a doctor specializing in skin diseases at Chinese People's Liberation Army 306 Hospital in Beijing, said willow seeds are a common allergen in spring, with patients displaying symptoms such as red and itchy skin. ""Those who are sensitive should take precautions such as wearing a mask when going out and avoiding eating spicy food,"" she said. In the 1960s, the government had limited money for landscaping in the capital, so the low-cost, fast-growing poplars and willows became the best choice at that time and were widely planted, said Zhang Jianguo, an expert at the forestry research institute of the Chinese Academy of Forestry. He said simply removing the existing trees wouldn't solve the problem, and those trees have made an essential ecological contribution to Beijing's environment over the decades. Zhang said, a typical poplar tree can absorb 172 kilograms of carbon dioxide and release 125 kg of oxygen annually."
0,"London-based violinist Huang Mengla and classical guitarist Yang Xuefei have collaborated on an album to explore the free, emotional and colorful expression of Latin music. In 2012, classical guitarist Yang Xuefei and violinist Huang Mengla did their first collaboration at a concert in the National Center for the Performing Arts in Beijing, paying tribute to Italian composer Niccolo Paganini. The partnership worked out so well that, six years later, Huang decided to approach Yang once more to jointly create an album on Latin music. ""The guitar plays a key role in interpreting Latin music and Yang was the first classical guitarist I could think of then,"" says Huang. In August this year, the duo spent two days in London's Angel Studios recording the album, which comprises pieces that are influenced by Spanish and South American music. On Nov 23, the pair arrived in Shanghai to share their latest work, titled Milonga del Angel, which was released under the Deutsche Grammophon label. ""The violin is usually paired with the piano or an orchestra. It's interesting to combine the violin with classical guitar,"" says Huang, 38, who was enrolled in the Shanghai Conservatory when he was just 8 years old. ""Unlike the traditional repertories I have played before, such as Austrian and German music works, Latin music is free, emotional and colorful. It feels like tasting different food when I'm playing it."" In 2002, Huang took the top prize at the prestigious Paganini International Violin Competition in Italy, where he also won the Renato De Barbieri Memorial award for the best interpretation of Paganini's caprices, and the Mario Ruminelli Memorial award. Yang chose a mix of original guitar compositions and arrangements, including Spanish composer Manuel de Falla's Danza Espanola No. 1 and Suite populaire espagnole, Argentine composer Astor Piazzolla's Histoire du Tango, Paganini's Sonata Concertata and even some of her own creations. ""The pieces we've recorded for the album display the versatility of both musical instruments and they are beautiful companions to each other,"" says Yang. ""The composers of these pieces are connected musically. For example, the three Spanish-born composers: Isaac Albeniz, Manuel de Falla, and Enrique Granados. Both of Albeniz and Granados were notable influences on the younger Falla. Paganini being from Italy and Piazzolla from Argentina both shared an understanding and love for the Spanish sound."",She adds that Paganini, a world-renowned virtuoso violinist, was also an accomplished guitarist and composer for the guitar. Both Yang and Huang recall that they had a fun time in the recording studio as the process of recording the new album was relaxed, spontaneous and entertaining, just like the nature of the music in their new album. ""When I recorded my last solo album, Colors of Brazil, there were about three people in the recording room. But this time, we had many people, including our friends and families, which was so much fun. It was an enjoyable experience, and that influenced the music we played,"" Yang says. ""One of my favorite composers is Piazzolla, whose music captures my ears with rich harmony, sensitivity and emotion,"" says Huang. ""During the recording, our feelings were synchronized with the sound of the music."" Yang adds that she likes collaborating with different artists, like vocalists and musical instrument players. For instance, she has recently been touring Chinese cities, including Shenzhen and Shanghai, with a Spanish dancer. ""The guitar is such an accessible and beautiful instrument. It works well with other musical instruments and art forms,"" she says. ""Through collaborations, the audience will get to know the musical instrument."" Yang, who was born in Beijing, is the first Chinese to study classical guitar at a Chinese music school - the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing - and also won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music in London. As a soloist, she tours the world and has been living in London for 18 years. Huang also studied at the Royal Academy of Music in London from 2007 to 2010 before he returned to Shanghai to teach at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music. In support of the new album, the two musicians will play in a concert held at the Royal Academy of Music in London in January before they hold more shows in Chinese cities next summer and winter."

From Friday to Sunday during the Tomb-sweeping Day holiday, also known as the Qingming Festival, 60 major retail and catering companies in Beijing registered a sales revenue of 1.79 billion yuan ($266.5 million), up by 6.2 percent from the previous year. At the same time, catering expenditure during nighttime hours, from 6:00 pm to 6:00 am the next day, surged nearly 50 percent, with categories such as snack food, drinks and barbecue being the most popular. Bankcard spending by tourists from outside the city in such terms as catering, tourism, accommodation and grocery shopping reached 340 million yuan, up 23.9 percent. The nighttime economy is becoming Beijing's new driver for consumption. According to the city's government work report released in January, Beijing will urge malls, supermarkets and convenience stores to stay open later."

As a tribute to the 25th anniversary of China's accessing the internet, the institute released the ""2019 Research Report on Corporate Social Responsibility of Chinese Internet Enterprises (I)"". Eight industries including e-commerce, social networking, video, transportation, car service, healthcare, tourism and online gaming were selected in the report to go through a screening and studying process on 110 analysis objects reflecting social value, product and service responsibility, entrepreneur responsibility, responsibility management and public welfare, as well as negative impacts. The report found that: 1. Alibaba (Taobao, T-mall) in e-commerce and Tencent (WeChat, QQ) in social networking both scored 65.40, ranking first in their industries; 2. In other six industries, Kuaishou of video (55.58), Meituan Dache of transportation (47.51), Tuhu of car service (51.04), WeDoctor of healthcare (60.78), Ctrip of tourism (60.19) and 37 Interactive Entertainment of network gaming (49.40) came out first in their respective industries. 3. On the whole, there is a big difference in social responsibility indexes for the eight industries. Healthcare has the best overall performance (average score: 50.54), while the average scores of network gaming, video and transportation are respectively 42.95, 42.75 and 38.14. 4. On product/service responsibility, video performs well (average score: 69.95), while tourism scores comparatively poorly (average score: 62.82). 5. On entrepreneur responsibility, healthcare and tourism performed best (74-point average), while transportation did badly (55-point average). 6. On public welfare, tourism and e-commerce had a good showing. 7. On social value, network gaming scored significantly lower than the other 7 industries. 8. Judging from public opinion, there is still some room for improvement between the performances of various industries and the expectations of the public. 9. Overall, the Internet Corporate Social Responsibility Management System needs to be further improved. Further research will be made by the institute in a variety of areas to reflect overall performance in corporate social responsibility by Chinese internet companies. With efforts like these, Chinese internet companies will be more conscious of CSR and be better enabled to carry it out, which will help promote the healthy and orderly development of the internet and meet people's demand for a better life in the information age. BNU Internet Institute, a non-profit academic research institution directly under Beijing Normal University, is a policy-based cross-disciplinary high-end think tank. The institute has centers for network communication, digital economy and industrial policy, internet corporate social responsibility, network rule of law, network information technology innovation, network security policy, international governance of cyberspace and network ethics and civilization. The institute will focus on the development of the global internet, meet major strategic needs of the country, uphold an objective, independent and fair academic stance, carry out research on internet development and governance, strengthen international exchanges and cooperation in cyberspace and make the internet better benefit mankind and society."
1,"Vice-Premier Liu He will visit the United States as President Xi Jinping's special envoy from Tuesday to Saturday for economic and trade talks, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Monday. Liu will lead a delegation in talks with the US team headed by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin at the invitation of the US administration, said Lu Kang, the ministry's spokesman. These will follow high-level meetings in Beijing on May 3 and 4. Both sides are expected to continue discussing issues like expansion of US exports to China, trade in services, two-way investment, the protection of intellectual property rights and the resolution of tariff and non-tariff measures, said Tu Xinquan, a trade professor at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. US President Donald Trump said on Sunday he has instructed the Commerce Department to help China's ZTE Corp get back to business, and Lu said China appreciates the latest positive comment on ZTE. He said China has maintained close communication with the US. ZTE, a major telecom equipment manufacturer, said last week it would suspend major operations following last month's move by Washington to ban US companies from selling certain computer chips to the Chinese company until 2025.,The US has accused ZTE of violating laws by illegally shipping US goods to Iran and breaching a deal reached last year. ZTE has appealed. ZTE says the ban would ""severely impact the survival and development"" of the company, which depends on US companies to supply about a quarter of its technology components. ""I see this as a positive step and hope it will create a better atmosphere for the ongoing discussions between the two countries,"" said Henry Levine, a former US deputy assistant secretary of commerce. ""I hope Beijing can respond with a positive step of its own and hope that both Beijing and Washington can begin a ... process where each takes positive steps and the other one responds with its own positive steps,"" he said. Eswar Prasad, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former China division chief at the International Monetary Fund, said the move of the Trump administration sets the stage for a temporary de-escalation of trade tensions between the two countries. ""It bodes well for the upcoming visit by Liu He to Washington and suggests that an agreement can be reached that allows both sides to claim at least a partial victory,"" he said.

0,"Graphic designer and artist Zhou Lingzhao, 99, still remembers his best friend in childhood, an indigenous dog his family kept in his native village in Central China's Hunan province. ""The black dog often accompanied me when I went into town,"" said Zhou, a retired professor at Beijing's Central Academy of Fine Arts. ""He protected me from the aggression of wild dogs wandering on a mountain slope."" A year ago, Zhou was commissioned by China Post to design the postal stamp to celebrate the Year of the Dog on the Chinese lunar calendar, which will begin Feb 26. He recalled the dog, and recreated it on one stamp. And he paired it with another stamp on which he drew a mother dog and a puppy, both of the same indigenous breed which is often referred to as the "" "", or China rural dog.,The two stamps were issued nationwide Friday. Each bears a face price of 1.2 yuan (18.5 US cents). The motif of the stamps highlights canine royalty and a blessing for being safe and sound, said Li Guohua, general manager of China Post. He says it also wishes for a good fortune, as  — the Chinese word for a dog's woof — is pronounced the same as a character meaning prosperity. Annually since 1980, China Post has issued special stamps featuring one Chinese zodiac animal corresponding to a lunar year. The dog for the upcoming Chinese New Year is the 11th in this repeating cycle of 12 animals. China Post has commissioned renowned artists to design the stamps for Chinese New Year, including Han Meilin for the Year of the Rooster in 2017 and Huang Yongyu for the Year of the Monkey in 2016.,Zhou is hailed as a top visual designer of New China. At the age of 30, he and his wife Chen Ruoju crafted the first portrait of late chairman Mao Zedong that was hung on the Tian'anmen Gate, before the inauguration ceremony of the People's Republic of China on Oct 1, 1949. Zhou was also involved in the designs of the national emblem and a former series of Renminbi notes. This is his second time to design New Year stamps for China Post. He previously created another Year of the Dog stamp, in 1982. He drew from decorative patterns and a vibrant palette of Chinese ethnic groups. ""He reduced the decorative elements this time, but he adopts a simple and true-to-life style,"" said daughter Zhou Rong, adding he wants to highlight the physical features and temperament of Chinese indigenous dogs.,The collection of Chinese New Year stamps still enjoys a huge fanbase across the country, though few people today need a stamp for mailing a postcard or letter. In cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, stamp buyers waited in lines outside post offices before opening hours Friday, according to Li. Meanwhile, an exhibition showing Zhou's stamp designs and all New Year stamps that have been issued by China Post is now running at the Museum of National Post and Postage Stamp in Beijing through February."

Premiered in Paris in 2016,   has been performed a number of times worldwide. Inspired by nature, Carlson wanted to make a statement for the future generations to create greater awareness of environmental issues and the threat of extinction that many species feel. ""We are all seeds. If you think about it, seeds that give birth, even the stars are seeds, thus the title of the piece,"" Carlson, the 73-year-old Paris-based artist, says in an email. ""We all share the same sun, a heart of emotions and perceptions. I believe   will be understood by an open public ready to receive a message, with no words needed to describe this poem ... simply watch and enjoy,"" she adds. The piece involves three dancers and a cartoon figure on video, named Elyx. Carlson's son, Aleksi Aubry-Carlson, composed the music for the piece. French visual artist Yacine Ait Kaci is behind the image of Elyx－a character that Carolyn Carlson describes as ""innocent but not naive, and universal"". Carolyn Carlson has always loved to improvise, which is part of her nature. During the past four decades and with more than 100 dance pieces in her career, she has had significant influence and success in many European countries. In 2014, she founded her dance company when she left the National Choreographic Center in Roubaix, France, which she had been directing for 10 years.,  Defining herself as a ""water lady"", she says that water is her favorite theme since she grew up near the Pacific Ocean, lived in Venice surrounded by water, and now she lives in Paris, where you find the Seine. She also calls herself a nomad, who travels a lot and lives in many places, such as New York, Paris, Venice and Helsinki. Growing up with a strong art influence, such as playing the piano, painting, acting, dancing, she would stage small shows at home for the family at a young age. However, it was in 1965 when she started working with American choreographer Alwin Nikolais in New York that she realized she wanted to be an artist. ""He totally changed my perspective on dance. He was so creative, with his four principles about movement: time, space, shape and perpetual motion. Choreographing for him was not only a question of steps, but also lights, costume, music, set ... a total performance. And he also passed on his love for transmission to me. Creating and learning were deeply connected for him,"" says Carolyn Carlson, who was trained at the San Francisco School of Ballet and at Utah University. Besides dance, she is also a poet and prefers the term ""visual poetry"" to ""choreography"" to describe her work, since poetry and synchronicity are the keywords to understand her art. ""I write what I can't dance and I dance what I can't write. And for my creations, I usually start by writing poems. I'm very inspired by everything that relates to paper actually, writing, reading, drawing,"" she says, adding that she cannot dissociate poetry and dance as they are deeply connected. ""My dance is strongly oriented toward philosophy and spirituality. I don't work with the technique or the steps, but with the heart. So every piece is a poem on its own. You give back to the public a poem without words."" Contact the writer at chennan@chinadaily.com.cn 7:30 pm, Saturday.

1,"BEIJING - Beijing's cultural and creative industries continued to grow steadily with total revenue hitting 1.36 trillion yuan ($215 billion) in the first 11 months of 2017, a local official said Thursday. The figure indicated an annual growth of 9.4 percent, said Zhao Lei, Party chief of the State-owned Cultural Assets Supervision and Administration of Beijing municipal government. Beijing planned to build 30 cultural and creative industries parks since 2016. By 2017, the capital city has completed construction of 21 cultural parks covering 400,000 square meters, by transforming old factories and wholesale markets. Of the country's 58 listed cultural and creative firms, Beijing has 21, with a total market value of more than 300 billion yuan. Beijing will set up special funds to aid the development of the cultural and creative industries, according to Zhao."
1,"Okay, 10.5 million yuan ($1.45 million)－that's the price of a 91-square-meter basement flat in western Xicheng district, the Beijing News reported earlier this year. If you find the price tag shocking, you need a reality check. As a mother of a would-be elementary school student, I'd say 115,006 yuan per sq m might be a good bargain－that is, if the basement flat, like the one in Xicheng, is in the neighborhood of a prestigious school, such as the Huang Cheng Gen Primary School and Beijing No 4 High School. The flat in question was built around 1990. The average sale price of new apartments in Beijing was 45,347 yuan per sq m in March, when the basement flat was sold at a huge premium. Premiums are paid because there is a strong correlation between perception and property prices. Chinese parents think education from reputable institutions, starting from kindergarten to university through primary, middle and high schools, is essential for success in an increasingly competitive society. So, a head start, in the form of education at a much-sought-after school, would help. Now, we know that when demand outstrips supply, then prices, including those of perception-propelled properties, rise－never mind their age or quality. And they rise everywhere. A 29.58-sq-m flat in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, was sold for 3 million yuan last November. That's 100,000 yuan per sq m, Zhejiang Online reported. This, at a time when Hangzhou's new homes were selling at an average 27,659 yuan per sq m. A similar flat in the same community was sold at 83,123 yuan per sq m a year ago. It's not much different outside China. For example, in the US, homes in a district with good schools command premium prices, although the price differential may not be as high as in China, said Hao Yue, a realty agent with Douglas Element Property in New York. Similarly, in England, homes near a good primary school add 18,600 pounds ($23,697) to the average price, the BBC reported recently, citing a study by the UK education department. Prices of homes near the best-performing primary schools are 8 percent higher and homes near the best secondary schools are 6.8 percent costlier. The UK education department said any of the top 10 percent of primary schools in London would add ￡38,800 to the value of a home nearby. The average home price in the UK's capital was ￡484,700 in July 2016. Analysts said amendments to current policies may help ease the pressure on Chinese parents to buy strategically located but ordinary properties at premium prices. If children are allowed to receive education from schools irrespective of whether their parents own or lease homes in the same locality, the property industry dynamic might change, they said. To ensure access to education is evenly balanced between children of parents owning homes in the neighborhood and children of parents leasing homes, the central government picked 12 cities for a trial of a new policy. Schools in many cities like Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Nanjing, Hangzhou and Xiamen now admit children of parents who rent homes in the neighborhood. In these cities, it is not necessary for parents to own homes in the school localities. Although Beijing and Shanghai don't figure in the list, Beijing has published regulations to guarantee children of parents living in rented homes receive proper education. For its part, Shanghai has set aside several land parcels for rental housing projects. ""For parents owning or leasing homes, equal rights to proper children's education are just the beginning of change. People will gradually realize that buying premium-priced property is not the only way to high-quality education,"" said Yan Yuejin, director of the E-house China Research and Development Institute, a Shanghai-based real estate information and research services provider. In the US, higher home prices in districts with good schools lead to higher property tax. That helps fund schools' infrastructure development and wages for top-quality teachers. Such an ecosystem ensures top quality of education. The flip side of market forces is that a good school will attract well-off families that are willing to pay a premium for residential properties in the neighborhood, thereby driving prices up."

Covering an area of around 20 hectares and adjacent to the core of Tongzhou, when complete it will widen access to school for the children living in this district and of families who move to Tongzhou due to relocated non-capital functions. ""Beijing School will adopt a new school system to provide 12 years of education in a row. We may shorten or prolong the length of schooling at different stages and make the textbooks of different grades better connected"", said Gao Chao, who is in charge of setting up the school. ""The school recruited over 100 graduates as teachers starting two years ago, most with a master's degree or a Ph.D. They are now teaching at other schools to improve themselves and gain experience,"" he added. Plans for Beijing School include 48 classrooms for the elementary section, 30 for lower secondary and 30 for upper secondary. The elementary section of the school, in the north part of the blueprint, was the first to be built and is projected to be completed next July and start enrollment next September. By the end of 2019, the construction of the secondary section, in the south part of the blueprint, would also come to an end. ""Beijing School will be a new example for promoting the all-around development of students, offer a test field for educational policies, establish a reputation for excellent education quality and build up a pool of talented teachers"", said Wang Qiang, deputy-director of the Beijing Municipal Commission of Development and Reform. A ""shared-by-all"" area that functions as a sports center, a cultural exchange venue and arts hub is to be built in the middle of the school and opened to nearby residents. People living in Tongzhou are expected to ""share"" the sports stadium to play basketball, badminton, table tennis and hockey, and theater in the school on weekends. The construction of Beijing School will be fully funded by the Beijing municipal government."
1,"Many consider some American-born Chinese as ""banana people"", who are viewed as ""yellow outside but white inside"". But Fred Engst also jokes he can be likened to an ""egg"" instead - ""white"" outside like Westerners, but ""yellow"" inside and devoted to China. The 59-year-old American was born in Beijing as the first child of Erwin Engst, known as Yang Zao in China, and Joan Hinton, or Han Chun, who arrived in the country in the 1940s to help agricultural development.  Fred Engst spent his first 22 years in China and was named Yang Heping.  Heping means ""peace"" in Chinese. Soong Ching Ling, the wife of modern China's founding father Sun Yat-sen, met the pregnant Hinton at the Asian Pacific Peace Conference in Beijing in 1952 and suggested the name. Fred Engst's mother was a former scientist who worked on the Manhattan Project's atom bomb. But she was extremely shocked and quit the project when the US government dropped bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan in 1945.  Hinton arrived in Shanghai in 1948 and went to Yan'an, Shaanxi province, where she married Erwin Engst, who had been working with the Party since 1946. The couple participated vigorously in China's efforts to build a socialist economy and worked extensively in agriculture.  Fred Engst himself was determined to settle down in the Chinese capital again and became a teacher at the University of International Business and Economics in 2007, after more than three decades in his parents' home country where the people were the same as him ""in appearance"". ""I can only feel at home here (in China),"" the economics professor says. ""I can easily tell right from wrong in China and can form my own opinion easily to evaluate a new social phenomenon, but I don't have a steering wheel in America,"" says Engst, who speaks in fast, pure Mandarin. ""I just have no emotional grounds for judgments.""  The difficulty of finding like-minded people was the last push that forced Engst to return to his birthplace.  If not for his daughters, Engst would never have thought of spending this summer vacation in the United States. It will be the first time he is visiting family since he returned to China. ""Few Americans have interests in issues that I am concerned about, like the socialist economy and the 'cultural revolution' (1966-1976). But here, I can have access to rich resources, books or witnesses,"" Engst says.  Engst says he is enjoying compiling his parents' records as well as reviewing and researching topics about his bygone days in China - between the 1950s and 1974 when he left China for the first time to the US out of curiosity. Engst spent his childhood in the Caotan dairy farm in Xi'an, capital of Shaanxi, before his parents were transferred to work in Beijing in 1965.  In 1969, when he was 17, Engst was appointed as a worker in the Beijing Guanghua Wood Processing Factory. The ""equal and harmonious relationship with comrades in the factory"" was a special time for him.  Engst says he had to struggle for more than three decades in the US, but the experience also made him realize why his parents believed in communism so firmly. ""As part of the generation who suffered World War II, they witnessed and understood clearly that capitalism would inevitably lead to imperialism, which would then unavoidably result in war,"" Engst says."

The company said it would take steps to integrate online and offline real estate businesses by creating a one-stop service platform that would integrate its capacities in marketing, services and the supply chain. JD.com will also establish a specialized team to work with other property companies in fields such as commercial real estate, tourism real estate, real estate for senior citizens and overseas real estate, as well as to develop in-depth tailor-made properties for consumers. The company also inked a strategic partnership with Country Garden Group, a property development firm based in Guangdong province, to launch a batch of high-quality houses and offer discounts to boost property sales during the upcoming Singles Day shopping spree. ""We want to position ourselves as a service provider for property developers and will jointly explore new business models with our partners in the future,"" said Zeng Fuhu, general manager of JD.com's real estate business unit. Currently there are 82 property sellers and 35 service providers on the platform, covering 2,027 projects in more than 20 cities, according to JD.com. ""JD.com has an upper hand in analyzing the consumption abilities and preferences of consumers and it can send matching property information to the sellers using big data,"" said Guo Yi, marketing director at Yahao Real Estate Selling and Consulting Solution Agency in Beijing. Guo said whether the cooperation can succeed depends on how JD.com chooses real estate sellers and sends accurate property information to prospective buyers. Apart from the housing sales market, JD.com has also entered the housing rental sector. Beijing Jingdong Shangke Information Technology, a subsidiary affiliated to JD.com, has won a bid from the Beijing housing rental supervision platform to provide technical support, according to an announcement on the official website of Beijing Municipal Commission of Housing and Urban-Rural Development. The announcement said the company has accumulated rich experience in internet technology application, especially big data and identity authentication. Another e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd has also entered the country's housing rental market. The technology giant signed an agreement with the Hangzhou city government to use the company's technology to create an online system for house rentals in August. People seeking houses for rent in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, would be able to use the application and website created by Alibaba for every stage in the process, from searching for apartments to signing contracts and payment."
1,"Media have the responsibility to tell authentic China-Africa stories, promote cooperation and strengthen ties, journalists agreed on Monday during a discussion about the role of the media. More than 50 media representatives from China and Africa gathered in Beijing to discuss the media's role in building a China-Africa community with a shared future, following last week's 2018 Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, or FOCAC. President Xi Jinping said during the opening ceremony of the summit that a China-Africa media cooperation network will be established, as the media represent one of the ways to ""strengthen the bonds between the people of China and Africa"". Nimley Nicolas Dweh, editor of Liberia's NEWS newspaper, said that only through the participation of the media can the Chinese and African people understand FOCAC and promote the development of China-Africa relations. He said the media need to produce more in-depth stories related to the achievements of the forum, such as in the fields of medical treatment, education and infrastructure construction. Guo Lin from Beijing's Guangming Daily said the media have an irreplaceable role in providing authentic and informative news products. ""Currently, there is a big gap in reporting between the two sides, so we should work closer to make our voice heard by the world,"" he said, adding that the Chinese and African media should use the internet and produce more new media content. Dweh suggested a training program for African journalists to more effectively communicate information related to FOCAC and China-Africa cooperation that will be beneficial for both sides. Ahmed Hazem Samir Sayed from Egypt's Al Gomhouria newspaper said that strengthening media capacity and cultivating more talent is the next step in cooperation. Ma Xiaoning from People's Daily said exchanging reporters can assist with mutual understanding. ""We are working to introduce Chinese stories to Africa, and more African stories should be brought to China,"" she said."
0,"BEIJING - Beijing has made addressing motor vehicle emission a focus of this year's air pollution control work, according to a senior environment protection official Tuesday. ""Targeting motor vehicle exhaust emissions is precise treatment for the city's smoggy weather as studies have found they are the top source of the city's major air pollutants,"" said Liu Bingjiang, an official with the Ministry of Environmental Protection. Liu said that factors leading to Beijing's air pollution had changed dramatically as coal consumption now made up less than 10 percent of the city's energy mix, and over 80 percent of Beijing's industries were in the tertiary sector. The smog-prone Chinese capital has intensified measures to improve its air quality in recent years and has achieved strong results. In 2017, Beijing switched 901 villages from reliance on coal to clean energy, and phased out nearly half a million outdated vehicles. Almost no coal consumption occurs in Beijing's six districts and its southern plain areas. The average density of PM2.5 in Beijing was 58 micrograms per cubic meter last year, meeting the target set by the State Council, and 20.5 percent less than in 2016. On Tuesday, the Beijing municipal environmental authority issued a yellow alert for smog, expected to last two days."

0,"A railway authority in northern China has been ordered to remove smoking areas and ashtrays on trains after it was accused of allowing passengers to smoke last year. Beijing Railway Transport Court made the ruling against the Harbin Railway Bureau on Monday afternoon, saying it would improve the traveling environment for passengers. Under Chinese law, smoking is banned on bullet trains, but there is no clear ban for slower trains. Legal experts and anti-smoking campaigners say the case is China’s first lawsuit seeking to ban smoking by suing the operator of a standard train service. The railway bureau’s attorney said he would consult with his client to see whether it planned to appeal. He added that the operator had taken measures against smoking in passenger cars since the lawsuit was filed last year. On June 9, 2017, a female passenger surnamed Li traveled from Beijing to Tianjin on train K1301 operated by the Harbin Railway Bureau. During the trip, she found lots of passengers smoking between the cars, even though the bureau’s safety tips said smoking was banned everywhere on the train. She complained, without effect, and then sued the railway bureau in August. The court heard the case publicly in December. During the trial, Li asked the judges to order the bureau to remove smoking areas and ashtrays, and demanded compensation of 102.5 yuan ($13) for her ticket, 3,000 yuan for legal expense and 1 yuan for the mental suffering the smokers caused her. On Monday, the court supported her request for the removal of smoking areas and ashtrays, but said the railway bureau did not need to pay compensation."

0,"A designated outdoor smoking area sprawling about 70 square meters on a landmark commercial street in Beijing has sparked a furious backlash from tobacco control advocates, who urged immediate removal of the installation. The outdoor smoking area, located in front of the Beijing Department Store on Wangfujing Street, is partially enclosed with flower beds, containing 13 cigarette ashtray stands and 18 benches. Within an hour on a chilly Tuesday, about five smokers stopped in the area to light up cigarettes. Zhang Jianshu, head of the Beijing Tobacco Control Association, denounced the installation as a severe violation of the city's tobacco control regulation launched in 2015. ""The regulation stipulates that smoking venues should be set up far away from areas where people often cross and cluster, and there must be prominent signage that informs the public of the health risks involved in smoking,"" he said. He added that the area risks blocking access for firefighting equipment, compounding the hazards it poses to public safety. Guo Jinyang, 23, a student who returned to Beijing for winter vacation, said the outdoor smoking area on the pedestrian street exposes passers-by to harmful fumes. ""It's inappropriate to have the facility in the open space,"" he said. ""Most smoking areas I've seen in other countries are at least enclosed."" Wangfujing Street, stretching 1,400 meters, is one of the city's iconic shopping areas. It sees an average of 250,000 visitors daily, about 70 percent of whom are domestic travelers from outside of Beijing or foreign tourists, according to the street's management authority. Zhang said the association has reached out to street regulators and government bodies, which promised to remove the installation. ""However, the ashtray stands and some adornments are made from steel that's difficult to dismantle. So preparations are underway to facilitate the removal,"" Zhang said. Beijing ZoomDu Eco-Technology Co, which led the design and construction of the smoking area, has built seven other designated venues for smokers across China. The majority are indoor smoking rooms at airports. Jia Peipei, the designer of the Wangfujing facility, said the intent was to respect the rights of smokers and protect nonsmokers from breathing secondhand smoke. The company was not immediately available for comment. Gauden Galea, the World Health Organization representative for China, said in an interview on Beijing TV, that he firmly rejected the notion that smoking is civilized when done in such an installation. ""By creating an atmosphere of so-called civilized smoking, the tobacco industry is trying to undermine the existing strong legislation to make Beijing a smoke-free city,"" he said.

Their last meeting took place in Beijing in April. Oleg Timofeev, an associate professor of China studies at Peoples' Friendship University of Russia, said the frequent meetings between the two presidents demonstrate the good political relations between China and Russia. Thanks to their personal relationship, the countries' ties are best they have ever been, he said. Natalia Pecheritsa, a professor and director of the Center for Asian and Pacific Countries at Russian New University said Xi's visit will have a positive effect on bilateral cooperation in various fields, not only in political and economic fields, but in cultural and educational areas as well. Vladimir Yakunin, chairman of the Dialogue of Civilizations Research Institute, said that against the backdrop of growing global discord, Xi's visit demonstrates the strategic relationship of the two countries. During Xi's visit, the two leaders will attend a series of events commemorating the 70th anniversary of the establishment of bilateral ties, which will include the official opening ceremony of a panda facility at Moscow Zoo, Zhang said. A pair of giant pandas were delivered to Moscow Zoo in April for research cooperation.

Beijing announced Jan 3 the launch of China's first road section for testing autonomous vehicles. In addition to the testing zone, the city will also upgrade road infrastructure, signs and markings to facilitate and identify self-driving vehicles. The capital city is not the only trailblazer, as Shanghai, Shenzhen and Chongqing have also tested the waters in this respect. Back in June 2016, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to pilot intelligent connections and self-driving, as the enclosed testing area at the China National Intelligent Connected Vehicle (Shanghai) Pilot Zone was inaugurated in the city's Jiading district. Shenzhen Bus Group started to test buses equipped with intelligent driving systems in Dec 2, 2017. Also in December, Chongqing's Economic and Information Technology Commission announced the creation of an all-around intelligent-connected vehicle testing zone in three phases.  However, the question remains whether it is legal to autonomously drive on the road. Self-driving is beyond the scope of the Road Traffic Safety Laws, which stipulate that automobiles must be driven by qualified drivers. Besides that, road facilities, direction and guidance are all needed to safeguard self-driving. Some local governments have issued regulations to tackle the problem. For example, the Beijing Commission of Transport issued a guiding opinion and interim regulations to promote the road testing of autonomous driving vehicles in December. The State Council issued a guideline on developing artificial intelligence in July 2017, articulating the advancement of autonomous vehicles and railroad transportation systems, establishment of indigenous technology systems and assembly capacities for autonomous vehicles, and exploration of the sharing of autonomous vehicles. Moreover, the National Development and Reform Commission, Ministry of Transport, and Ministry of Industry and Information Technology have all drafted or issued plans to accelerate the development of autonomous driving. A national conference on transportation work in December also highlighted autonomous driving, and proposed the building of a digital, intelligence-connected and smart transportation infrastructure."

On July 14, more than 600 travelers departed from a square in the downtown of Chifeng to take part in the city's second self-drive festival - a four-day trip to stone forests, lakes, water-meadows and grasslands using bikes, motorcycles, automobiles and recreational vehicles. Wang Yongsheng, 47, a Beijing motorcyclist says self-driving tours are a practical way to travel on the vast expanse of grassland. And that this allows him to fully enjoy the special landscape of Inner Mongolia. He adds that it is relatively safe to travel with such a big group. The past year has witnessed 50 self-drive clubs organizing group tours to Chifeng. And Over 60 percent of the 9.4 million tourists to the area in the first half of this year chose self-drive tours, according to the local tourism bureau. That's why the local government is sparing no effort to develop the city into a resort for self-drive travelers.,Besides the increasing popularity of self-drive tours, RVs capable of accommodating a family are also finding favor. Wu Xianglin, 57, joined an RV-share platform in May and later drove to Ordos, Beijing, Shanxi and Shandong provinces with her husband. ""Nowadays, traveling by trains or planes is not novel, so we are eager to get some other experiences,"" says the Baotou native. ""With an RV, we can sleep and cook in the vehicle, so there's no need to waste time and money on restaurants and hotels during the trip. ""Also, China has abundant tourism resources for us to explore, which is perfect for RV tours."" Wu also says that the platform has 2,800 RVs across the country and travelers can rent one for 1,000 yuan per day. ""To purchase an RV may not be feasible for many families, but sharing one is affordable,"" she says. Shi Yongjun, a RV seller in Chifeng says that local people seldom get chance to use RVs. So, the self-drive festival is a good way for them to be exposed to this mode of travel. ""Last year, we sold over 10 RVs in Chifeng, and most of the buyers were middle-aged people who have money and time on their hands."" says Shi, an RV enthusiast who drives to Hainan province every November for an annual RV exhibition. ""Hainan has constructed advanced camping sites for RV travelers which is lacking in Chifeng, says Shi. ""I hope enough camping sites and parking space can be built for this emerging form of transport in China."""

""It's vital to establish professional institutions to provide training to kindergarten staff,"" said Chu Zhaohui, a senior researcher at the National Institute of Education Sciences. Because many kindergarten teachers have a poor attendance rate and low academic qualifications, the best way to solve the problem is to provide professional guidance, Chu said. Kindergarten teacher training in the capital, starting in late June, included risk prevention, workplace ethics and management, as well as laws and regulations covering kindergartens. More than 3,000 kindergarten principals in Beijing took part in the training. Heads and members of teaching staffs from all of the capital's kindergartens are required to complete 30 hours of training, which includes an eight-hour face-to-face component and 22 hours of online courses, according to the education commission. The alleged child abuse at the Xintiandi branch of RYB kindergarten resulted in formal charges in May against a Beijing preschool teacher identified only as Liu from Hebei province. The suspect was detained on Dec 29 and accused of using needles to ""discipline"" her students. The allegations prompted a citywide inspection of kindergartens in November last year, and the city's education commission ordered all institutions to take immediate steps to reduce potential risks. Under new regulations, surveillance cameras will be required to cover all public areas in the capital's kindergartens. Safety education courses and emergency evacuation drills will also be carried out regularly to improve children's ability to protect themselves."

Car users will need to pay mileage and time fees. Starting from April 10, people ordering conventional cars through Didi's platform will be charged 1.6 yuan (about $0.23) per kilometer as a mileage fee. The time fee will be charged according to different periods. During the morning and evening rush hours it will be 0.8 yuan per minute, and from 9 pm to 6 am it will increase to one yuan per minute, the company said. In addition, the initial price and mileage fee have been adjusted to encourage long distance travel. The initial price of using a car through Didi's platform has been increased to 13 yuan from 10 yuan, and the mileage fee during normal times decreased from 0.2 yuan to 0.5 yuan per minute, the company said. Didi Chuxing's recent big data analysis showed that it was easier for people to get a car in Beijing between 10 am and 5 pm, with an average success rate of 83.2 percent, compared with between 9 pm and 11 pm, when only about half of orders could find cars. Many drivers had finished their workday by then, but demand for car use did not show an obvious decrease during this time, which caused a supply shortage. Didi also encouraged people to share cars during their travels and gave a 38 percent discount for car-sharing orders, the company said."

""Without a rich and prosperous culture, the Chinese nation cannot rejuvenate itself."" The Chinese film industry, an integral part of Chinese culture promotion, has played a more significant role in the ""new era."" Against such a backdrop, a symposium titled ""Status quo and the future of the Chinese film industry"", organized by the School of Arts and Communication of Beijing Normal University, was held in Beijing Nov 1. Twenty-six of the best minds -- college professors, scholars, experts, film critics, screenwriters and directors -- came together to discuss a range of issues, including the great achievements of the Chinese film industry in the past five years, the relationship between cultural confidence and film industry growth, and lessons we could learn from foreign countries.,One of the highlights of the seminar was a conversation about the great success of the Chinese blockbuster  which achieved massive sales at the box office and was highly praised by the public. ""The great success of   is not accidental as it manages to capture the positive energy of the new era. The spirit of patriotism shown in the film has struck a resonant chord among moviegoers,"" said Zhou Xing, professor of media studies at Beijing Normal University. ""From   to  Chinese-style heroism is storming into the hearts of movie fans. A qualified film not only offers a visual feast for viewers, but also inspires them to do something good for China and the world as a whole,"" said Hu Zhifeng, president of the School of Arts and Communication at Beijing Normal University. Zhang A'li, president of the Shaanxi Film Producers Association, echoed this point of view. ""Movies sometimes are a presentation of a story. In the past, Hollywood producers and filmmakers are passionate about introducing Western stories to other countries, but now   tells a good Chinese story to the world, and it is positive sign."" ""It is hoped that more fine Chinese culture can be known to moviegoers worldwide in the future. Therefore, the film industry matters a lot to China."" ""Wu Jing, director and actor for  really impresses me a lot for his rigorousness in terms of work and meticulousness in terms of details. The state-of-the-art technology utilized in the film is rare in the domestic film productions. Also, Wu has lived with military troops for two years. We have to admit that his personal life experience gives impetus to the storyline, as we all know art comes from life,"" said film director Liang Ming.,  ""The Chinese film industry is now undergoing a transformation and upgrading stage. In the process, some problems emerge and wait to be addressed. For example, films should not be judged by awards in international film festivals but by whether they meet the people's ever-growing need for a better life,"" said Zhao Baohua, vice-chairman of the China Film and Literature Association. ""The Chinese film industry has closely followed the steps of its Western counterparts for such a long period. Now, it is high time that Chinese filmmakers make some changes. Many aspects of traditional culture and customs have not been well-explored and put into the big screen. Expressions of Chinese feelings and emotions and reflections of traditions are still not shared as much in present film presentation,"" said Liu Jun, director of the Teaching and Research Department of the Beijing Film Academy. ""Several days ago, my mother told me that she wanted to go to the movies these days, but was at a loss to choose a film. That's a problem I would like to address here,"" said Ling Yan, dean of the Film and Television Department of Capital Normal University. ""Different groups have different tastes for movies. Young people are no doubt the mainstream for Chinese films in terms of purchasing power, but other groups should not be ignored. If the Chinese film industry wants to perform better in the future, other potential purchasing power should be considered."""
0,"The first phase of a new subway line connecting downtown Beijing to the new international airport under construction south of the city saw its first test run on Saturday, indicating that preparations for the opening of Beijing Daxing International Airport in September are in full swing, according to local officials. The rail transit line, designed to link the new airport in Daxing district and Caoqiao subway station in Fengtai district, spans 41.4 kilometers and passes through three subway stations in the capital. The train can reach speeds of up to 160 kilometers per hour. Automated subway trains will be used on the new airport line, said Yang Guangwu, chief engineer of the Beijing Major Projects Construction Headquarters Office. When put into operation in September along with the new airport, the trains will be capable of fully automated driverless operation and will be the fastest subway trains in China. Construction work at Beijing Daxing International Airport is expected to be completed by the end of this month, according to the Civil Aviation Administration of China. It will enter commercial operation before Sept 30. The new airport, which is located at the junction of Beijing's Daxing district and Langfang, a city in neighboring Hebei province, is designed to take pressure off the overcrowded Beijing Capital International Airport in the northeastern suburbs. Beijing Daxing International Airport is set to handle up to 45 million passengers annually by 2021, with the figure expected to rise to 72 million passengers by 2025. ""Operation of the new airport subway line means a lot to the capital's rail transit system, since it increases the average speed of urban rail transit in Beijing and will further boost the economic development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region,"" Yang said. The top speed of most subway trains in Beijing is currently around 80 km/h, he added. When the subway goes into operation, the 40-km journey from the city's south Third Ring Road at Caoqiao station to the terminals at the new airport will only take 19 minutes, said Jiang Chuanzhi, designer of the new airport line. He said the trains have a business-class carriage, six regular carriages and one for luggage, with each carriage about 22.8 meters long and 3.3 meters wide. Each train will be able to carry up to 1,500 passengers. Four elevators and two escalators will be installed at each station along the line, Jiang said. There are wheelchair spaces and USB charging ports next to the passenger seats on the trains, which are also equipped with variable-frequency air conditioners and LED lighting systems to save energy. According to the capital's railway corporation, the airport subway line was designed as part of the city's first three-layer cluster of transport infrastructure, with the subway line and an expressway above ground and a gas pipeline underground to fully use the space available. When the new airport in Daxing opens, it will increase the area of terminal facilities in Beijing by 700,000 square meters. The airport will have four runways and 268 parking bays, which will be able to accommodate 620,000 flights a year. At present, Beijing has two airports that serve commercial flights: Beijing Capital International Airport in Shunyi district and Beijing Nanyuan Airport in Fengtai district."
1,"Government authorities, alongside experts from home and abroad, are calling for more international cooperation to promote the sustainable development of online public services and governance at the fifth World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, Zhejiang province. The development of information and communication technologies has influenced every dimension of society, including the way the government interacts with citizens. The advent of electronic governance has advanced management reform. At 11 am on Oct 1, the Safe Beijing Sina Weibo micro-blog account advised its 12.5 million followers to be careful about the driving routes they selected since the weeklong National Day holiday would see millions of travelers from all over the country pour into Beijing, and tourist attractions and surrounding areas would likely be clogged with severe traffic congestion. Safe Beijing posted about 60 messages, detailing road closures, traffic updates, safety information and news stories, throughout the holiday. The posts were forwarded and commented on by the account's followers. One post - in response to an incident at a Beijing shopping mall in which three women snatched a baby from his stroller - was forwarded over 290,000 times. Safe Beijing is a new tool for Beijing's public security bureau, the city's primary police force. Online-governance services like Safe Beijing seek to increase the use of internet technologies to promote interaction among officials, citizens and businesses, and increase social services' availability, transparency and efficiency. Internet Plus governance was, for the first time, included in the government work report of the 2015 two sessions - the annual meeting of the country's top legislature and advisory body, the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. The State Council, China's Cabinet, then issued a guideline to promote the initiative and improve government services' quality and efficiency. Government bodies at all levels across the country have opened a total of more than 170,000 accounts on Sina Weibo, over 500,000 on WeChat and about 20,000 portals to improve administration, Xinhua News Agency reported in June. ""We're living in the internet age,"" says Renmin University professor of public administration and policy Fang Zhenbang. ""Using online tools to facilitate public services is an important step to accelerate governance reform, since the internet is the fastest and most convenient way for the government to interact with, and provide services for, the public."" E-governance is not only crucial to streamlining administration, strengthening supervision and optimizing services but is also important for transforming government functions, improving efficiency and transparency, and stimulating market vitality and social creativity, Fang says. It's not limited to government organs in the more-developed cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, but has also been growing in popularity in other parts of China in recent years. The government of Karamay in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region has developed its e-governance initiative since 2013, focused on informing citizens and promoting interaction. The local government built a website named ""smart community"" that integrates basic data from departments like public security, education, health, civil affairs and tourism. The portal enables residents to find the information they need online rather than actually visit government offices. ""We see the platform play an important role, especially in medical treatment,"" says Ye Yuantuan, deputy director of the Karamay Cloud Computing Industrial Park, which provides data to support the ""smart community"". ""For example, if a patient needs an emergency blood transfusion, medical staff can use the platform to quickly find a donor with the right blood type and rapidly reach that volunteer."" The platform also monitors such data as water, electricity and gas that's closely related to residents' daily lives, which enables the government to better care for the elderly. Community authorities visit retirees' homes if there are any abnormalities to make sure they're safe, Ye says. China had 802 million internet users and 470 million online-government-service users as of June, the China Internet Network Information Center reports. That's about 60 percent of all internet users in the country. While traditional e-governance applications have been infused into people's daily lives, government departments have started to use the latest social-networking services, such as Douyin, known as Tik Tok overseas, to reach wider audiences and expand services. Douyin was founded as a streaming service for music, gaming and dance videos in September 2016. Its popularity has skyrocketed since it diversified its content to include gourmet food, exercise, travel and culture. It attracted more than 150 million active daily users and 300 million a month between January and June. Over 40 percent were aged 24 to 30, the company says. Douyin's surging growth has encouraged more than 2,800 government departments and media organizations, including the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission and People.cn, to open accounts, according to the company's report in August. Shaanxi province's capital, Xi'an, has come to be known as Douyin's ""celebrity city"" because of the number of videos created there that have gone viral. The platform says its more than 610,000 short videos about the city had been watched more than 3.6 billion times by the end of April. Xi'an's tourism arrivals grew by nearly 40 percent year-on-year and tourism revenue increased by about 50 percent during the Tomb Sweeping Day holiday in April, the city's tourism development commission reports. Government-related Douyin accounts posted 100,000 videos that received more than 50 billion hits in the first nine months of the year, according to Beijing Byte-Dance Technology, a news and information-content provider. Chinese Academy of Governance professor of public management, Zhu Lijia, says the government is constantly working to improve communications. ""The government has kept pace with every new internet product, and every new media platform has enabled it to build a more approachable and interactive image,"" Zhu says. ""Many social issues have been resolved thanks to public exposure on internet platforms. People have places to comment, and the government hears their voices."" The 2018 United Nations E-Government Survey ranked China 34th among 193 countries and regions around the world in terms of the availability of online services in e-governance. China can learn from the top 10 countries, including neighbors, the Republic of Korea and Japan, Zhu says. Exploring new communication modes should be encouraged. But government departments should ultimately plan for long-term operations and not open accounts because of peer pressure or as vanity projects, Zhu adds."

1,"BEIJING - Optimism over a broad-based global recovery is gaining momentum in Davos, Switzerland, where policymakers and economists around the world have gathered to discuss a ""shared future"" at the ongoing World Economic Forum. Any topics on growth inevitably lead to discussions on China, which is playing an increasingly important role in setting the world's economic agenda as a major contributor to the global recovery. At Davos, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) raised its global growth forecast for 2018 and 2019 by 0.2 percentage points to 3.9 percent in its latest World Economic Outlook report, citing increased global growth momentum. China is expected to record growth pace of 6.6 percent in 2018, higher than the previous estimate, according to the IMF. World Bank data showed that China contributed 34 percent to world economic growth from 2012 to 2016, more than the contribution by the United States, European Union and Japan combined, according to Wang Jun, an official with the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). ""China remains the 'ballast stone and booster' of world economic recovery,"" Wang said. China's economy expanded 6.9 percent last year, picking up for the first time in seven years and well above the government annual target of around 6.5 percent. It's not only the better-than-expected growth number itself that fuelled optimism over the global recovery. China maintained medium-high growth with the help of booming domestic consumption, robust trade, and new technologies, which boosted external demand and international labor productivity, analysts said. ""The Chinese success story is deeply intertwined with the fortunes of the world economy,"" said David Lipton, IMF first deputy managing director, at a recent forum in Hong Kong. The world's most populous nation has always been a key market for international companies, but the country's shift toward a consumption-driven economy has made the market even more important. The contribution of consumption to economic growth reached 58.8 percent, up from 51.8 percent for 2012. At the same time, the Chinese increasingly crave products and services of better quality, creating opportunities for international brands. ""The rising purchasing power of China's middle class and their increasing tendency to accept new brands - domestic or international - will reshape the country's consumption market and inject new vitality to growth,"" said Lu Feng, director of China Macroeconomic Research Center with Peking University. The global recovery in 2017 was also helped by a rebound in trade. Despite rising anti-globalization sentiment, China has been an active promoter of foreign trade, with its total goods trade volume accounting for 8.8 percent of the world in the first 11 months of 2017, according to World Bank data. Trade volume reversed the downward trend seen in the previous two years and contributed about 9 percent to China's GDP expansion in 2017, NBS data showed. ""As a trading nation, China is a key partner for over 100 countries: countries that represent 80 percent of global GDP. It is the hub of global supply chains, a magnet for commodity exporters, and a source of final demand,"" Lipton said. While consumption or trade activities may still be prone to macroeconomic uncertainties, China is creating new growth drivers that will lead to stable, long-term growth. NBS data showed that new-energy vehicles, industrial robots, solar power and integrated circuit outshone most other industries in terms of output in 2017, contributing to a pick-up in industrial output growth in 2017. China plays a leading role in the development of fintech, robotics and artificial intelligence, and is a ""pacesetter"" for digital commerce, outweighing other countries in terms of online retailing and payments, Lipton said. With the sun shining on the global economy, it's time to ""fix the roof,"" according to IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde. ""To maintain a sustainable engine for global growth, China needs to tackle key challenge such as credit risks,"" Lipton said. ""China has a window of opportunity to accelerate economic reforms that can secure sustainable and inclusive growth."""
1,"Major Chinese cities are ranked among the world's mobility leaders thanks to their use of technology to drive the development of smart traffic, according to a recent report. Shenzhen is the best-performing city in China, ahead of Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong, when it comes to the deployment of intelligent traffic lights, grids and shared traffic, global consultancy Deloitte LLP said on Tuesday. The research investigated traffic conditions in 54 cities with economic and political influence globally－such as New York, London, Tokyo and Dubai－gauging 15 metrics including air quality, regulatory environment, congestion levels, public transport supply and versatility. ""The four Chinese cities score well in many areas such as investment, regulation, versatility and affordability. But in congestion and air quality their rankings are lower,"" said Simon Dixon, partner and global transportation leader at Deloitte. According to the report, Shenzhen in Guangdong province is using artificial intelligence and big data to improve road safety, communications and peer efficiency－such as leveraging technologies to identify images of traffic violators with 95 percent accuracy. It also pilots a real-time, data-backed parking management system, aiming to take 330,000 vehicles off the road each day in a bid to mitigate congestion. Other best practices include subsidizing charging infrastructure to accelerate electric vehicle adoption, the report said. The city's electric bus fleet will have more than 16,000 battery-powered buses in operation. Shanghai's strength lies in the expansion of transportation infrastructure that connects with neighboring cities such as Kunshan and Suzhou in Jiangsu province, while Beijing stands out for its encouragement of electric vehicle ownership and ride-hailing, the report noted. In comparison, Hong Kong is lagging behind its mainland counterparts in the testing and adoption of new technologies－such as ride sharing and autonomous vehicles－putting its position as a future mobility leader in peril. While not included in the report, best practices in smart transportation from other Chinese cities such as Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, and Suzhou stood out among their global peers, said Clare Ma, a Deloitte partner specializing in smart city research. For instance, Alibaba Group has helped local authorities in a number of Chinese cities to use massive computing power and data-processing capabilities to optimize traffic flows and deliver emergency responses. The company has even extended such capabilities to overseas cities such as Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia."
1,"JA China works with companies and schools to nurture young entrepreneurs. Zhang Zefeng reports. In a spacious hall filled with influential scholars and NGO representatives, five young entrepreneurs were invited onstage to share their ideas of entrepreneurship and innovation and offer their solutions for social issues. This was a scene from the youth forum under this year's World Philanthropy Forum, which took place in Beijing in late November. The Forum attracted over 400 guests, including UN representatives and government officials from 30 countries and regions. The youth forum focused on the idea of philanthropy, youth development and social talent development followed by panel discussions. ""These three elements are so essential for helping the global community,"" says Paul Chou, chairman and president, JA (Junior Achievement) China, a nonprofit youth organization that functions as the youth forum's rotating lead organizer. Aspiring to nurture global business talent in China, since its establishment in 1993, JA China has been working with companies and schools to deliver business and economic programs in primary and middle schools and universities in China. Huang Hongchuan had prior experience in business through selling things online, but his passion and talent for business weren't fully awakened until he took JA China classes in high school. While attending Zhixin High School in Guangzhou, Huang took economic and student entrepreneurship classes with JA China. ""They not only enlightened me academically, but also guided me to become an entrepreneur,"" says the 23-year-old founder of SupSing, an education company. Huang was listed in this year's Forbes China's 30 Under 30.,Over the years, JA China has worked with 5.59 million Chinese students to help them with job readiness, financial literacy and entrepreneurship through various programs and hands-on experience. Job Shadow Day, an academically motivating activity, gives students an up-close look at the world of work and answers the question: ""Why do I have to learn this?"" YESxBOP, Youth Enterprise Solutions for China's Bottom of the Pyramid, challenges young people to develop innovative business strategies to change the lives of low-income communities in China. One of its courses, JA Economics, has been included as part of the high school curriculum by the Beijing education authority, says Chou. According Asheesh Advani, president and CEO of JA Worldwide, the organization's mission is preparing young people for the future. To achieve that, they have developed ways to equip students with self-efficacy, a term that comes from US psychologist Albert Bandura's research. ""Self-efficacy means believing you will succeed. Once you believe you will succeed, your chance of succeeding goes up,"" says Advani. ""We believe that you can actually learn that you will succeed because the skills in the future are so unpredictable. Self-belief is a multiplier that allows you to learn whatever you need to change."" Founded in 1919, JA Worldwide is one of the world's largest youth-serving NGOs. It has a network of over 470,000 volunteers serving more than 10 million students in over 100 countries and regions. Lin Fugang joined his college's JA team during his sophomore year. He worked as project manager for his school team and organized events for JA Beijing. ""I spent three-quarters of my college years with JA China; most of my achievements derive from it,"" says the 21-year-old international trade major at Beijing University of Chemical Technology. ""It's a bridge between campus and the real world, which prepared me in terms of career development."" Lin currently interns at JA China's Beijing office, instead of going directly to graduate school as his peers did. He believes the experience will be a springboard for his future success. The company has also hosted a series of international activities to help students broaden their horizons and develop a global perspective. In March, for the first time, JA China will host the Junior Achievement Asia Pacific Company of the Year competition in Beijing, which involves more than 450,000 students a year globally. Students from different regions are expected to run their own businesses with support from volunteers from their local business community and compete against each other. ""I think this is an opportunity for not only the Chinese teams to host everyone, but also for the other teams to come to China,"" says Advani. ""Entrepreneurship is a means for peace, and entrepreneurship is the means for true global cooperation."""
1,"Public security officials in Hefei, the capital of East China's Anhui province, have set up a research center to track and prevent crimes in cyberspace.  ""While the internet brings convenience to our lives, it also facilitates the violation of laws, as some may find it easier to commit crimes,"" said Wang Liang, the deputy director of the Hefei Public Security Bureau's cybersecurity department.  The Cyber Crime Research Center, said to be the first of its kind in the country's public security system, was set up on Nov 15 jointly with a Beijing-based internet technology company. It is expected to help the local police act more effectively against cybercrime, according to Hefei police.  The facility, based in Hefei, will mainly serve the city, the local police said.  Speaking about the research center, Wang, who believes that most of the crime in the future will be committed via the internet, said: ""Data shows that nowadays about one-third of crimes are committed via the internet, and such crimes have been increasing by about 30 percent every year.""  For instance, he said, many banned items, such as guns, drugs and private information, have been illegally transacted on the internet, often in very secret ways.  Wang Zhe, also a deputy director of the local cybersecurity department, said: ""The criminals may also plan and organize crimes via social media.""  Meanwhile, though the cybersecurity department has been around for years, the authorities' technological strength is not enough to meet the increasing demand for cybersecurity, so they have had to work with leading internet security companies.  In many cases, the cybersecurity department merely acts on reports of crime, but the new center will do research on cybercrime on its own initiative.  ""Different solutions will be offered,"" said Wang Zhe.  In the first 10 months of this year, the Hefei public security authorities dealt with 2,644 cases of cybercrime and arrested 3,028 suspects, but they think the efficiency could be further improved through the research center in the future.  Separately, since its setting up, the facility has found 711 flaws on 39 local government department websites, in addition to tracking cases of hacking, illegal transaction of private information, prostitution and cyber gambling, according to Hefei police."

0,"Beijing-based wholly foreign-owned travel agencies are expected to dip their toes in the outbound tourism market, as the capital city has forwarded request for approval, Beijing Business Today reported on Monday. The move comes after Wan Cheng (Shanghai) Travel Service Co Ltd, controlled by a Hong Kong enterprise, became the first of its kind in Chinese mainland to run outbound travel business last year; and UK travel agency Thomas Cook set up a joint venture with Fosun Tourism group in Sanya, Hainan province, last week. Since 2003, when the first wholly foreign-owned travel agency established in China, these agencies have been only allowed to engage in inbound tourism, which was on a slow development track compared with robust outbound tourism market. Beijing Business Today cited data showing that more than 90 percent of nearly 30 foreign travel companies in Chinese mainland operated in the red until the first half of 2015. On the other hand, statistics from Ministry of Culture and Tourism revealed the number of Chinese visits abroad reached 71.31 million in the first six month of this year, a 15 percent increase from a year earlier. Meanwhile, China has been the top country in spending the most during traveling out of border for consecutive years, the newspaper said. Shi Jianzhong, secretary-general of Beijing Tourism Industry Association, told Beijing Business Today that competition in the sector will become fierce if wholly foreign-owned travel agencies participate in outbound tourism in China, adding that it is not a bad thing for a wider opening-up, because Chinese players could learn foreign management concept and promote product development and consumers will also have more choices with more affordable prices. And the tourism industry may face a shakeup, as foreign entrants, such as American Express, Germany's Touristik Union International and Japan Travel Bureau Foundation, could invest a lot to expand their sales network either built on their own or through acquisition, Liu Simin, a researcher at Beijing Foreign Studies University, said. But they also have to be ready for a long battle and understand Chinese market, Liu added. At the same time, industry insiders said high profits in outbound tourism seem lucrative, but many changes still remain in the business, including long-lasting process of market expanding and cultivating and high requirement for integrating capacity."
0,"As People's Liberation Army (PLA) of China celebrates its 85th Founding Anniversary on 1st August, I can’t help thinking of those old days when I stayed with Chinese soldiers.  PLA, true to its name always maintained its basic peoples' army character. It always bore in mind what Mao Zedong taught, army is more like a fish and people are like the water in a river. This has been the ethos of PLA and the essence of China's civil military relationship. PLA was never isolated from the broad masses and always remained deeply involved in all national developments and socioeconomic activities. It played a dominant role in national reconstruction and infrastructure building and combating natural disasters, like floods, cyclones, tornadoes, draughts and earthquakes. PLA always enjoyed the utmost trust, confidence, love and respect of the people of China. It is an all pervasive force with multidimensional characters. It is a fighting force par excellence with highest combat readiness. It is a productive force beyond comparison and skilled workforce, the colossus of which the world has not seen before.  I recall, I had the opportunity to live in a PLA unit in a garrison very near to Beijing for a month in mid 1977. It was a part of the study curriculum, during my study in Beijing Modern Languages Institute. President Ziaur Rahman, the visionary leader of Bangladesh, who believed in strong Sino-Bangla relation, sent me to China to study Chinese language for my future employment as military attaché in the embassy. In my outdoor study ( ) I was sent to a PLA unit, I lived in the military barracks along with the PLA junior commanders.    There was no rank system in PLA at that time and officers were called commanders and soldiers, the fighters. I put on their uniform, ate, worked, played and slept with them. I was introduced with the great master military strategist of ancient China, Sun Tzu and his epic work Art of War. I was given many tactical combat lessons. I was taken to the firing range to learn the skills of shooting. I found PLA soldiers were most accurate on to their targets and never missed any shot. The PLA unit where I lived was fully self-sufficient to cater its logistic needs. It had its own uniform and shoe making factory, it had its own agricultural fields to grow grains and vegetables, own farm yards to raise cattle and get meat and dairy products. The unit was even running a medicine factory to produce medicine for local use and surplus sold outside. I remember, in my Chinese language class text book there were many easy reading short stories. I read stories of Lei Feng, the great soldier of PLA, who dedicated his life for the service of poor people and was always available to rush in their crises and difficulties. The motto of PLA, he firmly believed, was  serve the people. Many such moving stories and their valuable lessons and my intimate stay with PLA soldiers enriched and helped me to know and understand them very closely. They all left a deep impression in my life and I still treasure them, cherish them. Now as I reminisce my good old days in China in my leisure hours at my home in Dhaka, strange spells of feelings strike me, I get somewhat nostalgic. China, I always considered my second home, I lived there in the 70s and 80s for more than half a decade. About 35 years ago when I lived in China, she made a tiny footprint in global economy and political and military power. Today as I see China, I am totally amazed. What a wonder China has done! China today has emerged as a most vibrant and strong nation already occupying the center stage of world economy and power. China’s phenomenal rise within shortest possible time (only three decades or so) is a miracle story. But miracles do happen. It happened in China. It happened because of country’s wise and able leadership, pragmatic correct policies, national unity and solidarity and harmony. The unifying factor and the stabilizing core element have always been PLA, the liberator, the redeemer. It indeed always remained most patriotic, dedicated, most loyal and trusted to the people as the name PLA indicates. It never failed in its tasks and never fell short of people's hopes and aspirations.  China, to protect its land, air and sea is vigorously and unabatedly pursuing its modernisation drive and is fully confident to thwart any eventuality. However, PLA, with all its big technological advancement and modernisation changes, the basic people's characters has not changed, it remains truly the people’s army, for the service of the people, for their welfare and wellbeing and for their security.  I recall, I was invited to China by PLA in 1996 when I was the Chief of Army staff. Brigadier Khairul Anam (now regular column writer in The Daily Star) was our defence attaché in Beijing. He arranged my meetings with top PLA leaders. I also had the honored privilege to meet His Excellency Jiang Zemin, the President of China and Chairman of the Central Military Comission, the highest military organ of the country. I remember, President Jiang said, ""China has changed a lot. It is not the same China which you saw when you lived here in the 70s and 80s"". He said, ""It is a changed China, developed China and it is a new generation, a new leadership."" He also said, ""The world is changing. I heard Dhaka skyline has also changed. But in all these changes one thing has not changed and it will never change and that is our relationship with Bangladesh, our policy for Bangladesh."" He continued, ""I assure you General, China is your friend and will ever remain a friend. In time of need she will be always beside you."" His words still ring in my ear. I treasure them. I believe this epitomizes our two militaries and two countries true relationship. Long live PLA. Long live Sino-Bangla defence cooperation."

Shi Lei, chief supervisor of the Beijing Flower Arrangement Association, said lectures on flower arrangements are given to reporters every day from 10 am to 12 noon, and from 2 pm to 4:30 pm. ""Friends from the media can do their own bouquets and take them home when they finish their work at the center. It's totally free,"" he said. ""It is a great way for reporters to relax and help them learn more about horticulture through these do-it-yourself bouquets."" He said this was the first time for a media center to present horticultural related activities. ""It adds a more human touch to the center,"" Shi said.

0,"The Kyrgyz pavilion at the Beijing Horticulture Expo offers insights into not only the Central Asian country's endemic flora but also its people, Yang Feiyue reports. A deer totem is painted on a yellow gravel road that leads to the Kyrgyz pavilion at the Beijing Horticulture Expo. The pavilion is one of the many that presents the latest achievements in floriculture and farming from more than 100 countries and organizations at the 162-day expo, which kicked off at the foot of the Great Wall in northwest Beijing's Yanqing district on April 29. ""In our culture, a deer symbolizes harmony between people and nature,"" says Azat Erkebaev, a senior official from the Kyrgyz Agriculture Ministry. Two stone sculptures symbolizing the Kyrgyz people's remembrances and tributes to their historical figures stand on both sides of the road, symbolizing the Silk Road that ran from China to Europe through Kyrgyzstan. It's worth noting that Beijing hosted the high-level Second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation just before the expo. The Kyrgyz pavilion covers an area of more than 1,000 square meters, including a garden and two rooms built like yurts, which are traditional Kyrgyz tent dwellings.,The picturesque garden hosts over 60 varieties of polychromatic flowers endemic to Kyrgyzstan. The larger yurt presents products from Kyrgyzstan. The smaller one showcases Kyrgyz food and cuisine. ""We tried to include as many Kyrgyz elements as possible in the pavilion's design,"" says Erkebaev, who has been in charge of the pavilion's operations from the beginning. ""The Chinese side has given us a lot of help in transportation and coordination."" All materials were purchased in, and transported from, Kyrgyzstan. The decorations and their designs were completed by Kyrgyz artists, Erkebaev says. ""We noticed the climate difference between the expo environment and Kyrgyzstan's, and made adjustments in construction and decoration materials,"" he says. The pavilion features environmentally friendly lighting, heat and waterproofing. The country has also brought over 800 products belonging to 17 categories to the expo. Kyrgyzstan hopes to showcase its distinctive organic plateau food and landscapes, Erkebaev says. The country is known for its pristine environment and quality agriculture. It produces honey, breads, mineral water, natural juices and wines. ""It's the first time for Kyrgyzstan to bring so many farm products to China at an expo, and our ultimate purpose is to help local enterprises and farmers bring natural and quality products to the Chinese market,"" Erkebaev says.,""The expo is a great platform to show our green and organic products before the Chinese people. Our President Sooronbay Jeenbekov, who opened the pavilion, highlighted the importance of the expo for the promotion of Kyrgyz natural goods."" The pavilion will host more activities to show what the country offers. ""Aug 31 marks our independence day, and we will try to invite our artists to give cultural performances at the expo,"" Erkebaev says. Plans call for a forum promoting bilateral tourism and business ties to be held soon. Erkebaev says the expo has publicized green development, and boosted cultural exchanges and integration among different countries. ""It's of great significance to raise public awareness of ecological protection, urge the public to engage in green lifestyles and educate the next generation,"" he says. The expo's international exhibition area has impressed Erkebaev. ""I've come to better understand various customs and practices through visiting exhibitions of other countries and talking to their people,"" he says. ""More importantly, our Agriculture Ministry and I could learn modern agricultural technology, such as advanced greenhouse systems and water-saving irrigation, which is what Kyrgyzstan needs the most in farming at the moment."" Erkebaev often tours other pavilions to learn exhibition design to best present his country's agricultural products. Over 10,000 people visited the Kyrgyz pavilion during the recent May Day holiday, Erkebaev says. ""It is the first time for many of those tourists to see our yurt, and they are amazed by the interior layout and decorations,"" Erkebaev says. ""They've also shown great interest in our honey, flour and wine."" Erkebaev studied at Peking University, starting in 1999, and deeply respects China. ""I hope all exhibitioners and visitors could see a Beijing with a blue sky and more green trees through the expo."" He also looks forward to the benefits the Belt and Road Initiative will bring to people in the involved countries."

0,"An abandoned industrial park in western Beijing will be turned into a venue for hosting sports and cultural events as part of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, a plan published on Wednesday said. Shougang Industrial Park, covering an area of 22.3 square kilometers, is a former steel plant that was vacated by State-owned Shougang Group when it moved to Caofeidian, Hebei province, in 2010. The Beijing city government, in coordination with some of the city's districts and bureaus, including the city's development and reform commission, produced the three-year action plan that will turn the area into a world-class city rejuvenation landmark by 2021. ""We will adopt the principle of preserving the original appearance of the park and fully use the existing facilities,"" said Hong Jiyuan, deputy director of the commission. He said it's important to reuse the industrial site, which will host the big-air snowboarding competition and related leisure activities in 2022. Big-air snowboarding is a new Winter Olympics event that involves snowboarders hurling themselves off a snow ramp in aerial stunts including complex flips and spins before landing on a slope. Along with preparing for Beijing 2022, the venue aims to host high-level athletic training and sports-related startups after the Games as part of the city's Olympic legacy, said Wang Shizhong, vice-president of Shougang Group. A bridge will be built across the Yongding River - which runs through the former steel mill in the capital's Shijingshan district - to better connect the suburb with downtown and build up a special Olympic community. The bridge is expected to be completed by September, concurrent with the park's opening, Wang said. A skywalk park, about 10 kilometers long, will be the main feature, he said. Four times longer than New York's High Line park, it is designed to be the world's longest park corridor. The project will restore the steel mill's original appearance, including lakes, according to the plan. Planning and design of the park will be green and intelligent to help rejuvenate the community, said Shi Weiliang, chief planner of the Beijing Municipal Commission of Planning and Natural Resources. An eco-friendly demonstration area will be built within the park, and the first 5G network technology system in the capital will be established there, he said. Three transport lines will also be built to cover 98 percent of the park's area, Shi added. This month, central authorities stressed the need to stay committed to hosting the 2022 Winter Olympics in a green, sharing, open and clean manner, and said advanced technological approaches should be used in the planning and construction of venues and infrastructure. Starbucks and the InterContinental Hotel company will set up operations in the park to improve its service facilities."

The fire in Shibalidian township was reported at 1:18 am, according to the municipal fire department. Police detained the owner of the building on Wednesday. Firefighters were able to rescue nine people trapped by the blaze. They were taken to the hospital for injuries that are not life-threatening. According to the fire department, the structure was built by a local resident and had four floors with more than 30 small rental rooms of less than 10 square meters each. There was only one exit on each floor. The roof and walls were a sort of sandwich - metal sheets with foam between them. They release toxic gas if burned, according to a firefighter. City officials have urged a thorough safety overhaul of illegally operated business venues and rental houses in Beijing. The fire department said the two electric bicycles were on the ground floor and blocked the exit, making it more difficult for people to escape. The bikes were connected by extension cords to an outlet on the second floor. A firefighter was quoted by Beijing News as saying that electric bicycles are not allowed in building passageways and should be charged outdoors on individual charging poles. The fire occurred less than a month after an apartment fire killed 19 in the city's southern Daxing district on Nov 18. That fire was caused by faulty electrical wiring.

Xi made the comments on Thursday in a meeting with US Marine General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff. Dunford, who arrived in Beijing on Monday night, is the first US senior military official to visit China since US President Donald Trump took office in January. Xi told Dunford that the world's two largest economies have major influence regionally and globally, and they bear key duties to secure world peace and stability and promote global development and prosperity. A good handle of the developing ties matters to both peoples and has profound influence on the global strategic picture, he said. Xi asked Dunford to relay his greeting to Trump, and said he welcomes Trump's visit to China, expected before this year ends. Speaking of the relations between the two militaries, Xi said such a tie is a key part of and key stabilizing factor for China-US relations, and the militaries have made progress in dialogue, building trust and cooperation.  Dunford said that under the navigation of President Xi and President Trump, the military relationship between the two has scored a number of advances as it has matured. Washington is committed to frank and professional dialogue with China regarding military affairs, expanding the scope of their exchanges and cooperation and managing and controlling risks, he said. Dunford's visit to China came amid tensions regarding the Korean Peninsula, and the situation there was a key item of his agenda. In a meeting earlier on Thursday, Vice-Chairman Fan Changlong of China's Central Military Commission told Dunford that China believes dialogue and reconciliation offer the only viable path toward resolving the peninsula's issues, and ""military means should not be an option"". All parties concerned should exercise restraint and avoid worsening tensions, Fan said. Beijing is ready to work with Washington in jointly playing positive roles to tackle the issues, Fan added.  Media reports noted that Dunford has said that Beijing should step up pressure on Pyongyang over the issue. In response, Foreign Ministry spokeswomen Hua Chunying said on Thursday that China's consistent stance on the issue will not change. ""It is no use to mislead or pressure (China), not to mention threatening (China)"" in this regard, Hua said.  China takes an objective and fair view when drafting the relevant policies, and Beijing is willing to maintain communication with Washington on the base of mutual respect, she added. Dunford also met with State Councilor Yang Jiechi on Thursday to talk about major international and regional issues. Zhang Zhihao contributed to this story."

Malware called ""Fireball"" was developed by a company located in Beijing's Haidian district to hijack browsers and profit from commissions on internet advertising by redirecting traffic, according to the Haidian sub-bureau of the municipal Public Security Bureau on Monday.  The company gained 80 million yuan ($12 million) last year from the malware, which was bundled with legitimate software provided to users, the sub-bureau said.  The suspects are charged with the crime of sabotaging a computer system, it said.  The malware mainly targeted overseas users.  Zhao Leiluo, deputy head of the sub-bureau, said the company was set up in 2015 and registered in Haidian district. The malware targeted the overseas users in an attempt to avoid supervision in China, he said.  The crime should be punished regardless of borders, Zhao said, adding that the enforcement action demonstrates the determination of police to curtail the practice.  Wang Jingjun, deputy head of the internet security division of the sub-bureau, said the suspects confessed to the crime. The malware they developed was first detected by an overseas computer lab.  Beijing Huorong Network Technology Co reported the malware to the police and assisted them in obtaining key evidence after it was discovered by security company Check Point Software Technologies based in San Carlos, California, near Silicon Valley.

From skiing simulators that offer immersive experiences on dry surfaces to high-tech winter sports gear and resort tours through VR goggles, the third edition of the international exposition will thrill visitors with the newest winter sports equipment, services and events from Sept 19 to 22 at the China National Convention Center, organizers said on Tuesday. The expo, which was launched in 2016, one year after Beijing won the bid for the 2022 Winter Olympic Games, will focus on enlightening the host in key areas, such as the post-Olympics operation of facilities and promotion of mass winter sports participation this year through exhibits, presentations and brainstorming forums featuring international experts. ""The expo has built a bridge between China and international winter sports powers for us to facilitate preparations for the 2022 Olympics and to boost development of the winter sports sector through extensive exchanges,"" said Gao Yunchao, deputy secretary-general of the Beijing Olympic City Development Association. The association, established after the 2008 Summer Olympics, has been organizing the expo with partner International Data Group since 2016. This year's event is expected to attract 500 brands, 24,000 exhibitors and 150,000 visitors, and will occupy 30,000 square meters. Highlighting the expo's forum session, a panel discussion with the mayors of 10 previous Olympics host cities will shed light on legacy and sustainability plans that Beijing could adopt to benefit its own post-Games operations. ""As a newcomer to winter sports, China is in desperate need of proven experience and expertise in developing winter sports sustainably beyond 2022,"" Gao said. ""I am sure the mayors' discussion will give us a lot of insights."" Some high-profile guests, including Juan Antonio Samaranch, a vice-president of the International Olympic Committee; International Ski Federation President Gian-Franco Kasper; and Karl Stoss, president of the Austrian Olympic Committee, will also share their understanding of Beijing's organization for the 2022 Olympics, China's winter sports prospects and business opportunities during the expo. Since winning the Winter Olympics bid, China has rolled out a national program involving 300 million people in winter sports activities leading up to 2022, drawing attention from international powers in the field. Austria, a snow sports power and a country of honor at the expo, is keen on helping China address winter sports development, especially in the operation of ski resorts, said Martin Glatz, commercial counselor at the Austrian embassy in Beijing. ""Of course the 2022 Olympics will give the whole winter sports sector in China a boost,"" Glatz told China Daily on Tuesday.

Under Beijing's plan, all skiing events of the 2022 Winter Olympics will be held at newly built and existing mountain resorts in northwest Beijing's Yanqing district and co-host city Zhangjiakou in Hebei province. Post-Olympics use of the facilities has been considered in construction and upgrade projects, according to the Beijing 2022 organizing committee. Diversifying the business and service offerings of Olympic resorts for yearlong operation is also critical, Glatz added. ""Don't just build resorts for winter but for all four seasons.

The Beijing-based supermarket chain caters for middle-aged and senior citizen customers, and has been operating in local communities since 1997. But this month the group opened three, small outlets in Beijing with the Japanese convenience store franchise, Lawson China Holdings Inc, in a bid to attract Millennial shoppers and white collar workers. ""Young consumers have grown into the habit of shopping at convenience stores, pushing the fast development of such formats,"" said Li Yanchuan, chairman of Chaoshifa. With 7,000 employees and more than 100 supermarkets, the group is ranked in China's top 500 chain-store enterprises and has a wealth of retail experience.     Last month, Chaoshifa and Lawson signed a cooperation agreement, with the Beijing group supplying the outlets and the Japanese company operating them. The plan is to have 10 24-hour convenience stores in place by the end of 2017. After that, they aim to open another 10 outlets each year. Fast food such as sushi, sandwiches, salads and coffee will be on sale along with 2,000 products. ""The convenience store sector in Beijing still has great potential and is far from reaching saturation point compared to Shanghai,"" Li said. Indeed, the decision by Chaoshifa to enter this part of the retail business shows the popularity of small, 24-hour shops in major Chinese cities. Last year, the sector increased by 13 percent to 130 billion yuan ($19.5 billion) compared with the same period in 2015, a report by the China Chain Store & Franchise Association highlighted. Revenue also jumped and store numbers expanded. ""First- and second-tier cities are the driving force behind the expansion of the smaller retail format and the sector has a great potential to develop,"" the 2017 China Convenience Store report stated. At the last count, there were more than 260 convenience brands in the country. Last year, the overall numbers climbed 9 percent to 98,000 outlets year-on-year. On average, daily revenue increased by 4 percent to 3,714 yuan per store during the same period, largely due to rising costs. Store rents have gone up by 7 percent on average while staff wages have grown 6.5 percent, the report showed. Water and electricity costs edged 0.7 percent higher, forcing retailers to improve management efficiency. Only 10 percent of the food products stocked by half of the convenience store operators surveyed was fresh, the report showed. In Japan, the proportion was between 30 and 40 percent. ""About 85 percent of the convenience stores have merchandise with their own brands, but the average ratio between self-owned products and other brands is only 8 percent,"" the report stated. Other key factors from the survey showed that nearly 30 percent of the retailers polled have yet to develop a franchise model. But up to 45 percent have adopted online shopping, which accounted for 10 percent of their revenue. Still, convenience stores face a myriad of challenges. ""They need to lift up their revenue by expanding their services, such as copy printing or ticket bookings as rents and labors costs eat into their profits,"" Jason Yu, general manager of Kantar Worldpanel China. ""High gross profit products, such as fresh food, will not be enough to improve the efficiency of convenience stores."""

Cultural exchanges and fusion have produced creative thinking and sustainable development, Lyu Zhou said during a session at the Conference on Dialogue of Asian Civilizations in Beijing on May 15. The Tsinghua University architecture professor adds that it's an important starting point to discuss exchanges of Asian cultures and civilizations. He was speaking at a session titled Safeguarding the Diversity of Asian Civilizations held by the Ministry of Education and UNESCO. Quanzhou in East China's Fujian province is a notable hub of the ancient Maritime Silk Road and has been a rendezvous point for religious cultures, including Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam and Manicheism. Lyu says the city's Manichean statue is the only one in the world. He points to it as an example of innovative development brought about by cultural exchanges. He calls for greater support for the application of the Historic Monuments and Sites of Ancient Quanzhou (Zayton) for UNESCO World Heritage listing in a year or two.,He also mentions how Buddhist architecture changed after arriving in China. Buddhist stupas - dome-shaped shrines that house relics - were infused with the local belief that sacred people ""dwell on high"" and evolved into what became known as tacha - the top part of a pagoda that's seen as a symbol of China's wooden pavilions. Changes in architectural style followed the voyages of Tang Dynasty (618-907) monk Jianzhen (688-763) to Japan, during which he brought Buddhism to the country. Chinese silk and porcelain promoted social and economic development along the ancient Silk Road and changed Westerners' lifestyles, while furniture, especially chairs, introduced to China since the Tang Dynasty changed Chinese people's habit of sitting on the ground, Lyu says. Chinese later infused such furnishings with local aesthetics and craftsmanship, and, during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), developed a furniture style that represented a pinnacle of art and skill. ""Cultural exchanges help us develop our own civilizations. It's mutual development rather than diminishing diversity, so that every civilization would benefit through the process. That's why we invite our neighbors to discuss Asian problems together,"" Lyu told Mobiheritage, an academic WeChat account that focuses on cultural-heritage preservation, after the session.,Jing Feng, chief of the Asia and the Pacific Unit at UNESCO's World Heritage Centre, said in a previous interview with the China News Service that UNESCO has been actively promoting intercultural dialogue as one of its core missions, and it's actively supporting and participating in the CDAC. He says cooperation in world-heritage preservation provides the CDAC with a good starting point to better present its role as an exchange platform. Lyu is the director of Tsinghua's National Heritage Center and vice-president of the Chinese National Committee for the International Council on Monuments and Sites. In December, he was elected as one of two co-chairs of the intergovernmental coordinating committee on the serial transnational world heritage nomination of the Silk Roads. The committee, founded in 2009, promotes coordination and cooperation around the protection and management of heritage in 14 countries along the ancient route in recent years. In 2014, Silk Roads: The Routes Network of the Chang'an-Tianshan Corridor, which spans 5,000 kilometers from Central China to Central Asia, became UNESCO's first transnational world-heritage site supported by a joint application by China, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.,Lyu has continued tracking World Heritage Committee sessions and examining the development of preservation over the years. He says China has leapfrogged in many realms, accumulated considerable experience and engaged in international communication. The way in which social forces have contributed to preservation, in addition to government efforts, have raised new questions, he says. How can stakeholders be mobilized? How can preservation work promote sustainable development and improve quality of life? Lyu cites the UNESCO site Gulangyu - a historical international settlement in Fujian - as an example of community preservation and effective responses to cultural exchanges. China needs more time to propose solutions and operational rules for institutionalization, and to align it with social interests, Lyu says. China is attaching growing importance to expressing cultural-heritage-preservation concepts to the international community. Lyu is leading the preparations for the application of Beijing's central axis - the roughly 8-km notational line along the city's historical center - to be listed by UNESCO. The work also includes explorations and discussions with international experts to define heritage's spatial scale in Beijing's historical area. ""The levels, content and ways of communication in international exchanges have been expanded,"" he says, adding that China is supporting international preservation. A China-Africa seminar on knowledge sharing and capacity building around world-heritage preservation will be staged in June to promote cooperation, he says."

Vice-Foreign Minister Kong Xuanyou said at a Beijing news briefing that it will be the first visit of a Chinese head of state to the United Arab Emirates in 29 years, and the first trip to Rwanda by a Chinese president. Xi will make state visits to the UAE, Senegal, Rwanda and South Africa from Thursday until July 24 and attend the 10th BRICS Summit in Johannesburg from July 25 to 27. The president will visit Mauritius during a stopover there from July 27 to 28. The Belt and Road Initiative will be an important focus since countries in the Middle East and Africa have a strong desire to take part in the initiative, Kong said. Xi will discuss how to better achieve win-win cooperation and build consensus. China hopes the initiative will create more economic cooperation, draw the countries closer through culture and boost friendship and mutual trust, Kong said. China welcomes African countries to help build the Belt and Road. Cooperation will also be discussed at the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in September, he said. ""The UAE was the first Gulf state that established a strategic partnership with China,"" Kong said. The visit will push forward Belt and Road construction in the Gulf and promote peace and stability in the Middle East, he said. Zhang Jun, director-general of the Foreign Ministry's international economics department, said the BRICS summit is expected to voice agreement on safeguarding multilateralism and building an open world economy. BRICS countries are strongly against unilateralism and protectionism, which have now become the common concerns and worries of the international community, Zhang said."

The top 10 cities in the list were New York, London, Paris, Tokyo, San Francisco, Berlin, Beijing, Los Angeles, Shanghai and Rome. Other Chinese cities such as Hong Kong (25th), Guangzhou (36th), Shenzhen (39th) and Taipei (40th) also made it to the list. The teams from the universities evaluated 51 international cities based on statistics from government official websites, urban cultural yearbooks and authoritative organizations such as UNESCO and World Bank. Shanghai was also ranked first in terms of public involvement in cultural activities, seventh in cultural tourism and ninth in cultural supply. Beijing was ranked second, third and fourth in these respective areas. Xu Jian, leader of the research team from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, said that Shanghai has room to further improve the development of its cultural sector. He noted that Shanghai's ratings in this aspect did not match its global reputation as an international cultural metropolis. ""Shanghai should be shaped as a city interwoven with regional and Western culture, Jiangnan-style culture and ‘red culture' to the world. We should carry out strategic measures to promote the culture of Shanghai,"" said Xu. He suggested that Shanghai could establish core cultural industries with distinctive advantages, such as an e-sports industry with ChinaJoy as its platform, or a global film and television creation center with the Shanghai International Film Festival as a multi-functional communication platform. Xu also said that Shanghai should make its culture more competitive by improving public cultural services and upgrading the structure of its residents' cultural consumption. For example, theme bookstores, as a place for both entertainment and business, can not only encourage more customers to buy books, but also meet their cultural needs."

Tim Cook, CEO of Apple Inc, said only countries that embrace openness, trade and diversity can achieve success and be exceptional, when asked what suggestions he would give to the US President Donald Trump on trade relations with China. Cook made the comments Saturday at the China Development Forum in Beijing. ""One plus one equals three. The pie is going bigger through cooperation,"" Cook said.,Laurence D. Fink, CEO of BlackRock Inc, the world's largest money management firm, said a trade war cannot solve problems. ""Dialogue and maybe some adjustments in trade policies can be at work."" Fink made the comments when asked what suggestions he would give to the US President Donald Trump regarding China-US trade relations on Saturday in Beijing. ""Both the US and China have benefited greatly from globalization. The world needs a stronger China and a stronger US,"" he said at the China Development Forum. ""The world is not a public fight in which we reduce future opportunities,"" he said, highlighting that the recent stock market falls speak louder about how businesses feel about the Trump administration's policies. He said he hoped that both countries can find common ground through dialogue to rebuild trust and better bilateral economic and trade relations.,Jean-Sebastien Jacques, CEO of Rio Tinto, a leading global mining group, said the company stands for free trade, which is essential to business. The growth of a company like Rio Tinto relies on the growth of GDP as well as free trade, with some 80 to 90 percent of its products moving from one country to another, he said during an interview with China Daily on Saturday. ""History shows only with free trade can we create wealth, and that comes from full cooperation but not isolation,"" he said. Jacques said he believed China and the United States, the two most important countries in the world, will fully understand free trade. Common sense will prevail and common sense must prevail, he said. According to Jacques, the next 45-60 days will be very important and people should put disputes on the table, discussing them and sorting them out.,An escalation of trade tensions between the United States and China could drive down the global economy and multinational companies would suffer, said Sergio Ermotti, chief executive of UBS Group, on Saturday. The trade situation between the two countries needs to be taken seriously as it will have global ramifications, and an escalation of the situation could be dangerous, Ermotti told China Daily on the sidelines of the China Development Forum. While it is early to make a judgment on how the events will play out, the head of the Swiss bank said that it is not just a US and China issue, and the ramifications of potential moves of the US and what the countries may do to each other may trigger a complex situation. ""For the time being, we do not expect the measures so far to have a major effect on the economies and the financial markets, but if things move beyond where we are today, that will be our concerns,"" Ermotti said."
1,"BEIJING - Consultation between China and the United States on economic and trade issues will be constructive as long as the US delegation comes with sincerity, said a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wednesday. Spokesperson Hua Chunying made the remarks in response to a question regarding the upcoming China visit by a US delegation comprising of high-ranking trade and economic officials. At the regular daily news briefing Wednesday, Hua confirmed the visit, saying that China welcomes the visit by the US delegation led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Mnuchin, who is also US president's special envoy, will lead the US delegation to visit China from Thursday to Friday. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, will exchange views on China-US economic and trade issues of common concern with the US delegation. China and the United States are the world's top two economies. Properly settling issues in economic and trade relations through equal consultations and maintaining the overall stability of trade relations are undoubtedly in line with the common interests of both sides and will help world economic stability and growth, said the spokesperson. Given the volume of the two economies and the complexity of their relations, it is unrealistic to expect to solve all the problems through one single consultation, Hua said. As long as the US delegation is sincere about maintaining the overall stability of China-US economic and trade relations and an attitude of mutual respect, equal consultation and mutual benefits, the consultation will be constructive, Hua said."

According to one document, China will provide beneficial loans to Djibouti. The cooperation documents were signed at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing and witnessed by President Xi Jinping and Guelleh. The two presidents agreed to establish a China-Djibouti strategic partnership and deepen cooperation in all areas. Before their talks, Xi hosted a grand ceremony in the capital to welcome the African leader. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations 38 years ago, China and Djibouti have boosted mutual understanding and respect, supported each other's core interests and major concerns and set an example for China-Africa friendship, Xi said. China would push forward practical cooperation with Djibouti in such areas as railways, seaports, construction of a liquefied natural gas pipeline, free trade zone and agriculture, Xi said. He said Beijing would continue to help Djibouti improve local medical facilities, broaden human resources cooperation and boost people-to-people exchanges. Noting that China attaches great importance to deepening relations with Djibouti, Xi called on joint efforts to push forward collaborating on the Belt and Road Initiative, enhance cooperation in all areas and benefit the people of both sides. Xi expressed gratitude for Guelleh's congratulatory message on the success of last month's 19th CPC National Congress and his re-election as general secretary of the CPC Central Committee. The congress has made blueprints for China's long-term development, Xi said, adding that China will continue to be a sincere friend and reliable partner for developing countries. Since Guelleh became Djibouti's president in 1999, he has led the people to explore a development path fitting for the country's situation, maintained a stable political situation and achieved sustainable economic and social development, Xi said. Guelleh once again offered congratulations on the success of the congress and on Xi's re-election as general secretary. Djibouti would like to proactively participate in the Belt and Road Initiative and enhance cooperation with China by constructing infrastructure and improving the people's livelihoods, Guelleh said. Guelleh appreciated China's efforts in joining the United Nations peacekeeping operations and fighting pirates. He expressed gratitude for China's key role in safeguarding global peace and prosperity. Chen Xiaodong, assistant foreign minister, told reporters that the two presidents exchanged viewpoints on the PLA's Djibouti Logistics Support Base, which was officially established in July. Building the Djibouti base will not only help China better fulfill its international duties, including peacekeeping and rescue, but also bring security for the development of Djibouti, Chen said. The Djibouti Logistic Support Base could benefit multiple parties, he said, adding that it will contribute to the security of the Horn of Africa. The base is conducive to overseas tasks, including military cooperation, joint exercises, evacuating and protecting overseas Chinese and emergency rescue, as well as jointly maintaining security of international strategic seaways. On Nov 3, while inspecting the Central Military Commission's joint battle command center as its commander in chief, Xi had video chats with troops at frontier posts and the support base in Djibouti."

0,"China's efforts against air pollution have made steady progress since 2013, and the accumulated experience is valuable around the world, a regional head of a New York-based NGO said. ""The record of achievements that have been delivered in the past five years is amazing. Everybody living in Beijing can feel the difference in air quality,"" said Zhang Jianyu, chief representative for the Environmental Defense Fund in China. ""China managed to turn mission impossible into a systematic success,"" Zhang said, adding that progress has been observed in aspects such as mapping the sources and movement of pollutants, and adopting technologies to reduce and monitor emissions. From policy design to implementation and enforcement, both at the central and local levels, China's system has improved, he said. Beijing saw a dramatic decline in air pollution last year and in January reported the best air quality in the past five years. The average concentration of PM2.5－hazardous airborne particles－dropped to a record-low 34 micrograms per cubic meter, according to the municipal environmental protection bureau. The reduction targets set by the central government in the national air pollution campaign were reached on schedule in most cities, including Beijing, said Li Ganjie, minister of ecology and environment. The bluer skies were not easily won. Beijing and neighboring regions, including Hebei province, have made aggressive moves against pollution through strict controls－closures of highly polluting factories, a shift to clean energy for winter heating and improvements to the industrial structure. ""One of the major breakthroughs－starting from last year, in particular－was curtailing the use of coal and controlling small-and medium-sized emission sources, which in the past were beyond measurement range,"" he said. The Ministry of Ecology and Environment has assigned 5,600 inspectors for a year to 28 major cities in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region since March, its largest campaign to date. More than 62,000 polluting plants have been shut down. The bluer skies have also come at a price. The short-term actions such as shutting down plants and changing fuels have significantly affected some parts of society. But it's necessary to help the governments buy the time and space needed to let long-term measures－technologies, policies and laws－take hold, Zhang said. After setting up offices in China in 1998, the NGO has participated in projects with governments and institutes to help China establish market-based incentives for trimming emissions and strengthening the enforcement of environmental laws. To date, more than 43,000 environmental officers have received training from its programs. Daily cumulative fines with no upper limit－a powerful tool in deterring and regulating polluters－were adopted in the Environmental Protection Law based on the experience of the United States, Zhang said. China's law took effect in 2015. He added that the permit system is also a major step in pollution control. It's time, he said, to ""summarize and understand what China has gone through, and we can help to share that experience with other countries that are in the middle of this, or that are going to face it soon"". For example, India is suffering severe air pollution, and China's experience in creating countermeasures could help. ""Countries participating in the Belt and Road Initiative are a good place to share China's accumulated experience－or at least to reference it,"" Zhang said. ""The low-hanging fruit is gone. More challenges are in front of us, and it's just the beginning."""

Planes in neighboring lines should be strictly separated,"" he added. As introduced by Fu, some 30 people worked to connect the planes. It took them nearly 20 hours to meet the final standard Marco Frigatti, Global Records senior vice-president of Greater China at Guinness World Records, said: ""There are so many world records in China.

Xi visited the Wukesong Arena and Capital Gymnasium, venues for the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, to listen to briefings on preparatory work and watch the training of winter sports teams. He said the 2022 Beijing Olympics will be an iconic event and should be hosted in a sustainable, open-minded and frugal way with a lasting legacy. ""The 2022 Olympics will provide a good opportunity to develop our country and boost the national morale. The preparation and organization should follow rational planning, and we should learn from overseas expertise and use resources frugally,"" Xi said during a meeting attended by members of the organizing committee and other departments on Friday. Xi also stressed the importance of post-event use of venues and said the 2022 Olympics must be free of corruption. Beijing, host of the 2008 Summer Olympics, and Zhangjiakou, Hebei province, won the rights in 2015 to host the 2022 Winter Olympics. Beijing also will become the first city in the world to hold both winter and summer Games. Earlier on Friday, Xi talked about winter sports improvement. He also witnessed training sessions of a junior ice hockey team and the national short-track speed skating and figure skating squads at the two venues. ""Our athletes perform well in ice-based events while lagging behind in skiing events.

As of Friday, the Chinese delegation had won 14 gold medals to stand second in the medal tally, after host Japan, in Sapporo. The games end on Sunday. China won three gold, four silver and two bronze medals, ranking 12th in the medal tally, at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. Xi hailed the national athletes' fighting spirit and hard work on Friday while encouraging them to compete for better international results. At the end of an ice hockey scrimmage by a group of elementary school students from Beijing, Xi shook hands with each of them while praising their skills. ""I hope some of you will make your way to the national team in the future,"" he said. There are 2,000 junior players registered with the Beijing Ice Hockey Association, reflecting the growing popularity of the sport among youth and increasing public awareness of winter sports in China after Beijing won the 2022 hosting rights. Inspired by Xi, China is rolling out a national plan to involve 300 million people in winter sports and related activities by 2022. Zhao Hongbo, head coach of the Chinese pairs figure skating team who briefed Xi on the development of the sport on Friday, said Xi's interest and instruction were inspirational. ""He listened to the briefing very carefully and asked questions. His presence motivated us greatly,"" said Zhao, who won a gold medal in figure skating with partner Shen Xue at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics."

""China will stick to supply-side reform and make efforts to build world-class multi-airport systems to better establish world-class metroplexes,"" said Feng Zhenglin, head of the Civil Aviation Administration of China, adding that it will boost construction of an air ""silk road"" connecting China with the world. Speaking at the 2017 China Civil Aviation Development Forum in Beijing, he said, ""City clusters and multi-airport systems are the essence and trend of global city development"". Feng said the United Nations estimated that by 2025 the top 40 metroplexes will engage in 66 percent of global economic activity and 85 percent of technology innovation. China's three core city clusters－the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta－account for 2.8 percent of the country's territory. During the 11th Five-Year Plan (2006-10), the three city clusters, as the most vigorous, open and innovative regions in China, produced 36 percent of the GDP and gathered 18 percent of the total population, he said. In 2016, the passenger turnover in the airport clusters of the three regions reached 473 million, accounting for 46.5 percent of passengers nationwide. Freight traffic was 14.69 million tons, 74.7 percent of China's total. Last year, Beijing Capital International Airport ranked as the second-busiest airport in the world for the seventh consecutive year, with 94.4 million passengers flying in and out of the airport. Two airports in Shanghai carried more than 100 million passengers in 2016. Hong Kong's airport ranked top in the world regarding freight transport. Airports in Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Macao are getting busier. ""The multi-airport system in the three city clusters are ready to grow, as is the world-class multi-airport system,"" Feng said. ""Air transport is the modern means of transportation. The development of clusters of cities and clusters of airports is closely relevant and has been promoted mutually,"" Transport Minister Li Xiaopeng said.

Lai Chunrong put out an appeal for 1 million yuan on shuidichou.com after her son, Wu Shuai, a cross talk performer, was admitted to hospital on April 8, 2019, with a brain haemorrhage. In her appeal, Lai suggested the family could not afford her son's treatment, as both parents had retired and were living on pensions. However, she has since put an end to her campaign after it was revealed her family owned two apartments in Beijing, as well as a car. As of May 3, 2019, the online campaign on shuidichou.com had raised just under 148,000 yuan ($22,000). Shuidichou.com has since responded to the situation last night, May 5 amid online concerns that it should be more responsible in vetting who puts out calls for donations via its platform, and informed public that as of May 5, 2019, the money had not been transferred to the hospital from the platform. The website is designed as a fundraising platform for poverty-stricken families to appeal for medical help.

He followed his father's advice to study clinical medicine at university.  He began his career as a general practitioner, but was frustrated at dealing with so many patients with terminal illnesses. In response, he became a surgeon before moving into gynecology.  Gong earned his reputation by conducting a five-hour operation to save a young woman's uterus, removing 419 fibroid tumors individually. Other doctors had suggested a hysterectomy.  ""I think about each patient's future,"" he said.  He now works in private hospitals where a consultation usually costs 420 yuan, about 60 times the official fee when he worked in public hospitals.  Some people have criticized Gong for ""only working for the rich"", but he countered by pointing out that doctors at private hospitals save patients hours of waiting, and more important, give more time to each consultation - at least 15 minutes.  ""The doctors and the patients both benefit,"" he said.  Since 2009, government regulations have allowed doctors to register at more than one hospital or start their own clinics, but Gong has been a lonely pioneer.  By 2015, about 45,000 doctors had registered at more than one hospital, but only about 37 percent came from top public hospitals.  Those who hesitate to break away fear the loss of patients, because top public hospitals always have thousands more cases than private establishments.  ""Chinese people prefer to judge doctors by the hospitals they work for,"" Gong said. ""They trust public hospitals and trust the medical staff. So freelance doctors, who have been stereotyped as quacks in the past, have to compete in the market.""  Doctors must offer excellent services to please their patients, according to Gong, who established a website called China Obstetrics and Gynecology in 2000.  Initially, he used the site to share research and professional essays from overseas, but after he uploaded a video about a new method of treating postpartum bleeding, he received a message: ""I saved a uterus today after learning about the treatment through your online video. Thank you very much.""  That moment made Gong realize the huge power of the internet.  In 2012, he wrote an article in which he claimed that many women were diagnosed or even prescribed treatments for ""cervical erosion"", which is not a real condition in his opinion. He put the essay on Sina Weibo, where it was quickly reposted 33,000 times and garnered more than 4,000 comments.  He also has millions of followers on WeChat and other online clinics that share medical science and advice. He also offers two pregnancy apps.  Now, about 90 percent of his patients come to him through the internet.  The government is stepping up efforts to improve medical services. During the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-20), medical consultations via family doctors will be encouraged, and the government will pilot a hierarchical medical system in 85 percent of China's regions. Medical competence at the grassroots level will be improved and more resources will be allocated for lower-tier institutions.  Gong and his team have also begun working with public hospitals in second- and third-tier cities, seeing patients and conducting surgeries at hospitals in the provinces of Hebei and Zhejiang.  Gao Xia, vice-president of the Zhangjiakou Women and Children's Hospital, said Gong's service not only attracts more patients, but also helps to train local staff: ""Patients do not need to go to Beijing to see good doctors.""  Every month, Gong flies to two or three cities, and even though his life is busier, he feels freer.  ""I will keep working hard to improve healthcare in China,"" he said."
0,"Nationals from 53 countries and regions became eligible for 144-hour visa-free entry in Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei province starting Thursday in a move linked to the Belt and Road Initiative and the integrated growth strategy of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei. Nationals from 53 countries with eligible travel identification and reserved tickets with a fixed date to a third country or region within 144 hours are eligible for the new visa-free entry period. They include the United States, Australia and the Republic of Korea. ""The new policy extends the visa-free stay for travelers who want to visit the three regions, allowing foreigners sufficient time for a short visit for travel, business meetings or visiting friends and family. It will boost the tourism industry,"" said Zhu Lei, deputy head of Beijing's port of entry office. Beijing and Tianjin previously allowed a 72-hour visa-free stay. The 72-hour stay has been allowed by Beijing since 2013. ""The number of foreigners eligible for the free-visa policy has increased gradually,"" Zhu said. ""The policy has been praised by international travelers. But based on a survey, about 40 percent of international travelers said 72 hours is insufficient for them to enjoy the city of Beijing, and they wished to extend their stay,"" Zhu said. In 2016, the 72-hour stay in Beijing was used on 26,323 passenger trips, an increase of 32 percent from 2015. Ports of entry are also extended to designated international railway ports, seaports and airports, said Ji Lixia, deputy general head of the Beijing General Station of Exit and Entry Frontier Inspection. Travelers can arrive using six entry points, two in each jurisdiction: Beijing Capital International Airport and Beijing West Railway Station in the capital, Tianjin Binhai International Airport and Tianjin International Cruise Home Port in Tianjin, and Shijiazhuang Zhengding International Airport and Qinhuangdao seaport in Hebei province. Previously, the policy applied only at airports. ""The diversification of ports for entry is convenient for international travelers to choose suitable transportation based on their travel plans,"" Ji said. The Beijing airport has started a new policy to help travelers. ""The airport can keep luggage for those travelers for 144 hours for free,"" said Meng Xianwei, general manager of the aviation business department of the airport. In 2016, Shanghai and Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces took the lead in permitting 144-hour visa-free entry for visitors from 51 countries and regions.

It was the capital's first month in autumn and winter without a single day of severe air pollution since 2013. The concentration was 4 mcg/cu m lower than the previous record low, which occurred in August, the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau said. The improvement in the air quality is due to government efforts to improve pollution control in Beijing and surrounding regions, as well as favorable meteorological conditions, which caused pollutants to disperse."
1,"Jinan city has failed to shed its unwanted title as ""the most congested Chinese city"".  For people living in the capital city of East China's Shandong province, they have to allow an extra 30 minutes during morning and evening rush hours, according to a report on transportation conditions in major Chinese cities in the first quarter of 2017.  The report, released by domestic navigation company Amap, found  The report noted a growing number of shared-bicycle riders contributed to the decrease of cars on the roads within 5 kilometers of first-tier cities. The number of car trips made in Beijing and Shanghai dropped 3.8 percent and 3.3 percent respectively in the first quarter.  Affected by downfalls of snow, Hohhot, a third-tier city of North China's Inner Mongolia autonomous region, became one of the top three traffic-clogged cities, with its time-delay index in rush-hour congestion reaching 1.91.  Since coming in as the sixth most congested city, Guangzhou's Shenzhen made big progress in easing congestion this year, as has the previously eighth placed Hangzhou in Zhejiang.  Both cities dropped out of the top 10 traffic hot spots.  Let's take a look at the Chinese cities with the worst traffic so far this year."
0,"The Beijing Education Commission said on Sunday night that a thorough safety inspection will be conducted at all kindergartens citywide, with an education inspector assigned to monitor the process.  Results will be listed in a database that includes information on the kindergartens' facilities, safety and management systems. Those with potential risks and problems will be improved immediately, it said.  The move follows accusations of child abuse at a Beijing kindergarten in the Xintiandi community of Chaoyang district. The kindergarten is affiliated with RYB Education, an international preschool provider listed on the New York Stock Exchange.  All districts in Beijing have been asked to set up a mechanism for kindergartens that will allow parents and communities to communicate in an emergency.  The commission will provide overall checks of the qualifications of people running kindergartens, as well the preschools' health and safety status, level of nursing education and management structures.  Fire-control systems and the preschools' canteens are the key areas for the safety inspectors. Potential or hidden dangers will be corrected immediately, especially those involving a lack of equipment, according to the education commission.  A proposal released by the Beijing Preschool Education Society stressed the importance of protecting toddlers' physical safety, as well as children's legal rights.  The faculty at kindergartens must also be held to strict standards, the commission said, and the professional level of faculty team-building should be improved.  The addition of surveillance cameras was requested for kindergartens - allowing for full visual coverage of a facility, according to a report in Beijing Youth Daily.  The supervision of some kindergartens in Dongcheng district have been connected to the public security bureau's network. Full-coverage digital surveillance has been installed in a number of Beijing kindergartens, as required by the authorities.  ""Cameras have been installed in our kindergarten. A classroom should have 360-degree coverage,"" the newspaper quoted a kindergarten worker in Haidian district as saying.  A kindergarten in Dongcheng district said surveillance cameras have been set up in all areas of the school, including stairways, playgrounds, classrooms and kitchens. The only places not covered are the toilets.  Boarding kindergartens were also asked to install night cameras.  The head of the RYB Xintiandi kindergarten and a teacher allegedly involved in child abuse were detained on Saturday, according to a statement by the police.  Several parents reportedly told police on Wednesday that their children, all about 3 years old, had suspicious needle marks on their bodies and had been given white pills on numerous occasions."
0,"Younger students experience school bullying more frequently than older children, and boys are affected by the problem more than girls, a new survey has found. The 21st Century Education Research Institute, a think tank in Beijing, interviewed more than 1,000 students from 12 schools in the capital: four primary schools, four junior middle schools and four high schools. It found almost half had been intentionally bumped into or knocked down by a classmate, while about 6 percent said they are physical bullied on a daily basis. The findings also suggested that students at standard schools experience more bullying than those at top institutions, with children from impoverished families more likely to be bullied. Being bullied can have an adverse effect on a child's personal development and academic performance, according to Zhou Jinyan, a researcher at Beijing Normal University's Institute of Educational Economics. ""Children who have been bullied find it hard to trust others,"" said Zhou, who led the study. ""They lack self-confidence and often feel anxious, angry or depressed, affecting their ability to control their own life."" In recent years, there have been frequent reports of bullying incidents at schools in China, attracting widespread attention. Zhou suggested three ways to resolve the problem: improving communication between teachers and students; establishing a more harmonious atmosphere among children; and ensuring parental participation in children's education."
0,"The Beijing Education Commission canceled all outdoor activities on Monday for students in primary and secondary schools, kindergartens and vocational schools after strong winds led to four deaths in the capital. The high winds caused three pedestrian fatalities after a wall toppled in a commercial area near Dongzhimen in downtown Beijing at around 4:40 pm Sunday, according to Dongcheng district's micro blog. Two died at the scene and one at a hospital. A large tree was blown over in Xicheng district at about the same time and killed a deliveryman, Beijing Youth Daily reported. Earlier on Sunday, the Beijing Meteorological Service issued a blue alert for heavy winds expected to hit the capital from 10 am Sunday until Monday evening. The meteorological service warned that some areas might face level 7 wind gusts. It also warned people of the danger of falling objects. China has a four-color weather alert system, with red representing the most severe, followed by orange, yellow and blue. Another five district meteorological bureaus in Beijing successively upgraded alert levels to yellow later in the afternoon. The districts - Tongzhou, Yanqing, Changping, Huairou and Shunyi - were hit by strong winds of levels 8 to 9 and some areas reaching level 10 - from 88 to 102 kilometers per hour. Zhao Wei, a chief forecaster with the meteorological service, said that due to the high temperatures in the capital over the past few days, atmospheric conditions were ripe for powerful gusts. ""It's common to see windy days in Beijing, especially during the transition from Spring to Summer,"" she said. ""However, the strength this time is much more than expected."" By 6 pm Sunday, 51 out of 1,561 scheduled flights had been canceled at Beijing Capital International Airport, and two trains to the capital were delayed, according to transport authorities. Li Zhaonan, a 27-year-old white-collar worker in Beijing, said he was frightened by the bumpy arrival of his flight to Beijing on Monday. ""My heart was in my mouth for about 20 minutes as the plane was tossed around,"" he said. Some large trees downed by strong winds fell across railway lines from Chengde, Hebei province, to Beijing on Sunday afternoon.

1,"This winter, China's tourism and recreation industry is seeing new activities: helicopters rides to go skiing and later eat hotpot food at custom resorts; shooting pictures with reindeer; visits to ice and snow museums. Northeast China, the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region in Northwest China, Japan, Switzerland and North America, have emerged as the top skiing destinations for avid Chinese skiers, according to Qunar, an online travel firm that was acquired by Ctrip, China's largest online travel agency. More affluent millennials, including those born after 1995 and 2000, spend most of their leisure time skiing and snowboarding. Ski lovers in China, whose numbers are rising, go skiing almost four times a year on average, and their per-capita spend exceeded 1,300 yuan ($191) each time. The volume of online searches on mobile phones for skiing products surged 79 percent over last winter, Qunar found. ""From a pure sport, skiing has become a comprehensive travel experience. It comprises admission tickets, hotels, training, snow museum visits and delicacy savoring,"" said Song Yawen, director of themed tours at Qunar. The 2022 Winter Olympics will be held in Beijing and Zhangjiakou city, Hebei province, located about 200 kilometers northwest of Beijing. In the run-up to the quadrennial event, these places are attracting skiing fans. High-speed trains will soon connect Beijing and Zhangjiakou, and shrink travel time from four hours to about one hour. ""By buying our new recreation service online, a consumer can take a 35-minute helicopter ride from Beijing to Chongli for 3,000 yuan. Four people can fly at a time. Hanging baskets can carry along cargo like skiing gear,"" Song said. ""Besides, we have introduced some snow-related travel products with activities like snowmobile rides, sledge rides, ice sculpting and winter fishing."" In Ewenki autonomous banner of North China, playing with reindeer and dog sled is part of ice-and snow-themed tour packages. For Tian Shen, 26, a bank employee and an experienced skier in Beijing, winter means hitting the white slopes at various places in China. She has been going to ski resorts in Zhangjiakou almost every weekend this winter. Around New Year's Day, she made a trip to Songhua Lake, Jilin province in Northeast China, one of the most popular skiing destinations in the country. ""I love the feeling of fast sliding, and as control over my body gets better and better with practice, it makes me feel good. This year, I plan to try more difficult movements of snowboarding that require skill,"" Tian said. She said a season card costs 16,800 yuan and allows one to go skiing for unlimited number of times at a ski ranch in Zhangjiakou. There are many other discount options and lucky draw opportunities to get free season cards."
1,"The World Bank Group is and will continue working closely with the Chinese government on the Belt and Road Initiative, according to the chief of the international financial institution. Jim Yong Kim, president of the World Bank Group, praised the initiative on Thursday during a press conference of the 2017 IMF/World Bank annual spring meeting in Washington. ""The One Belt, One Road project is an extremely important one for the Chinese government and also for us,"" said Kim, who is scheduled to attend the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation to be held in Beijing on May 14-15. Twenty-eight heads of state and government leaders have confirmed they will attend the meeting. ""The leadership that China is now taking in the overall world of development I think is unprecedented,"" he said. Kim, who has visited China many times, said China has been stepping up and illustrating that it is concerned about development, not just in neighboring countries or even along the Old Silk Road, but globally. He said the World Bank Group has a very close working relationship with the Chinese government and also with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). ""We'll be signing another memorandum of understanding,"" he said.,  ""Not only are we engaged, for example, in a major study with China right now on the drivers of China's future economic growth, but we're partnering with AIIB already,"" he said, adding that there were two major projects that the World Bank co-financed with AIIB in Indonesia. ""So our expectation is that our engagement both with the Chinese government and with Chinese efforts at development, both through their own bilateral cooperation, but also through AIIB, will only grow going into the future,"" said Kim, who became the World Bank Group president in 2012. ""We've discussed at great length our approach of trying to crowd in much more private sector capital and the Chinese are very much in agreement with what we're trying to accomplish,"" he said. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said a few days ago that China will use the Belt and Road forum to build a more open and efficient international cooperation platform; a closer, stronger partnership network; and to push for a more just, reasonable and balanced international governance system. On Thursday, Kim also praised China's embrace of globalization and its success in lifting 800 million people out of poverty in the past decades.,  ""That happened when it embraced the global market, when it opened itself to competition, when it engaged more and more in trade,"" Kim said, without naming the United States and some European nations, where protectionism sentiment has been running strong. Kim said trade has been an extremely important part of global economic growth and an extremely important part of the poverty reduction in the last 30 years. ""We continue to argue that freer trade, more openness, is actually critical for the future of the world, and there may be individual countries that choose to look inward, but just because those individual countries look inward doesn't mean everyone else is going to look inward,"" he said. Kim cited China as ""a good example"". ""China is not going to stop trading with all of its trading partners and it's not going to stop continuing to work with Latin America. China's work in those countries has only gone up over the last few years, and I think it will go up further,"" he said."
1,"The United States' capricious way of policymaking and holding ""big sticks"" for negotiations will do no good in solving problems and China has to take strong countermeasures, the Ministry of Commerce said on Thursday. Gao Feng, spokesman of the ministry, said the two sides had achieved positive outcome in agriculture and energy sectors during previous talks in both Washington in May and in Beijing early this month.  ""The two sides once agreed to have another round of talk on manufacturing and service sectors and hold a detailed discussion on the structural issue in the following days,"" Gao said. ""However, we are deeply sorry that the US has been acting unpredictably with its policymaking and has triggered a trade war."" Gao said the outcome from the previous talks had been positive and productive, but China had to respond in a strong manner because the US government was being unpredictable and challenging. ""The US is accustomed to negotiating with others while holding 'big sticks',"" Gao added. "" But it does not work for China, and such irrational behavior will do no good in solving any issue."""
0,"Never in her wildest dreams did Liu Zhai imagine that participating in soccer training would change her life and take her so far from home.   Born into a poor family - both her parents have congenital hearing impairments - the student at Jinzhai Siyuan Experimental School lived a gloomy life until early last year, when the Real Madrid Foundation brought its charitable soccer program to Jinzhai, a rural county in western Anhui province.   The formerly shy girl who barely spoke or participated in afterschool activities has become one of the most active players in her class after taking part in games once a week during last year's spring semester. She had never seen the game before then.   Her genuine interest, highlighted by her smiling face and her ponytail swinging wildly during the game, is a stark contrast to her previous incarnation as a quiet student who always looked heavy-hearted.   ""I didn't expect to love soccer because I had no idea about it at all,"" said the 12-year-old student, who once only had real conversations at home with her younger sister.   ""We don't have a TV set at home, so I had never watched it or heard about it before. I was chosen by my teacher to take part in the training because my academic grades are good. Soon, I found that I love this sport because I feel so free and I forget about any troubles while I'm on the pitch.""   Through participating in the program, Liu has also realized a long-cherished dream - to visit Tian'anmen Square in Beijing.   In October, Liu was one of eight students selected from her school to travel to the capital and take part in a soccer training clinic. It was the first time she had set foot outside her mountainous county.   During the weeklong visit, Liu practiced with foreign children from international schools in Beijing under the guidance of Spanish trainers, visited landmarks, including the Great Wall, and built a friendship with a volunteer teacher from Beijing Sport University.   ""It's the most beautiful memory of my life so far,"" she said.   Liu shared her stories of the visit with her parents by showing them photos she took of Tian'anmen Square, the Great Wall, the soccer pitch and even her hotel room, delighting the hardworking couple.   ""My father was so excited that he shared the pictures with a lot of relatives and neighbors right away. I felt even happier that I'd pleased him in this way,"" she said.   According to Miao Dingguo, a geography teacher at the Siyuan school who also teaches soccer part-time after receiving training via the Real Madrid program, there are too many cases similar to Liu's - children who have embraced a positive life via soccer - to name.   ""A lot of the children have become more self-confident, more open-minded and more active in socializing. Those positive changes have been reflected in the classroom as well. The educational value of the game has been recognized,"" Miao said.    (China Daily 06/15/2017 page6)"
1,"A typical photo of a successful Chinese businessmen in the 1980s often featured a brick-sized prototype mobile phone. Such phones were too big to conceal in the palm of one's hand and could do nothing except make and receive calls. But it highlights that when mobile communication services were first brought to China, they were positioned as a luxury service. After decades of development, however, smartphones are becoming omnipresent in the country, and can help users do almost everything from buying movie tickets to booking medical appointment. Behind the popularity of mobile services across China stands a company that has also evolved from a little player into the world's largest telecom operator: China Mobile Communications Group Co Ltd. As of October, the Beijing-based company has more than 900 million mobile subscribers. It was just 31 years after a mobile telecom service was first enabled in the Chinese mainland in 1987 to help people in Guangdong province communicate with those in Hong Kong and Macao. Now after building the world's largest 4G network, China Mobile is scrambling to establish a beachhead in the upcoming 5G era, in which almost everything can be connected to the internet. Shang Bing, chairman of China Mobile, said the company intends to build a globally leading fifth generation network by combining 5G mobile communication technology with artificial intelligence and cloud technology. ""We will focus on standalone 5G network structure, push forward the cloud deployment of superfast technology and build an intelligent network by boosting operational efficiency with AI,"" Shang added. The company has already played a significant role in the finalization of the first phase of global 5G standards, which kicked off the home stretch toward commercial 5G services. That's part of its broader push for 5G pre-commercial use in 2019 and commercialization in 2020. The fifth-generation mobile communication technology is expected to be at least 10 times faster than 4G and can enable movie downloads in seconds. In the first half of next year, China Mobile will also launch 5G smartphones, said Li Huidi, vice-president of the major telecommunication carrier. Such eagerness and determination to experiment with new things is well demonstrated by China Mobile's development in the past decades. It was the first Chinese mainland telecom player to get listed on overseas trading platforms, going public in Hong Kong and New York in 1997. China Mobile was also among the first batch of State-owned companies to hire popular stars to be its brand ambassadors. In the 2000s, it courted Jay Chou to represent its new brand M-zone to expand its appeal among young people. Zhang Wentao, a 26-year-old bank employee, said China's huge telecom transformation is evidently mirrored in his experience at train stations. He remembered clearly how painstaking it was to go home during the Spring Festival travel rush in the past. He had to stand in a long line for hours outside a train station on a freezing and windy day to just get a ticket from Chongqing to his hometown of Nanchang in Jiangxi province. But now all he needs to get a ticket is to use his smartphone. With quick taps on a mobile app, he can now book a ticket, make payments and even order takeout food and have it delivered to his high-speed train seat. ""When I pass through ticket checks at stations, I no longer need to wait in long, meandering queues, because artificial-intelligence-powered (monitors at the) gates can verify my face and let me pass through in three to five seconds,"" Zhang said. ""I know the pre-requisite for all these services is good network infrastructure. And that is what China's telecom companies have provided,"" Zhang added."

He has filed a lawsuit against the two companies, the court said. The student demanded the two companies delete the photos immediately and issue an open letter of apology in a national newspaper. The student, who arrived in China to study in 2011, also asked for compensation of 300,000 yuan ($46,800), the court said. Ofo said in a statement on Monday it had not been notified of the case by the court. The student said a friend playing an online game had seen an Ofo advertisement pop up that used his portrait to promote its shared bikes and had told him about it. The student said he searched online and found his portrait on Ofo's page on Baike, as well as on Beijing Bikelock Technology's website, which used his foreign identity to publicize and promote its overseas strategy and highlight its global nature. The student said his friends thought he had earned money from doing a commercial for Ofo, but he did not know about it. International students from Saudi Arabia are not allowed to work and portraits of Saudi Arabian students used in commercials need to be approved by the country's embassy. If not, he said, he could be penalized. The student said Beijing Bikelock Technology used his portrait without his consent for commercial interests, and Baidu did not fulfill its obligation to review the content on Baike. Zhu Wei, deputy director of the Communication Law Research Center at China University of Political Science and Law, said that according to the Civil Law, it is a clear case of infringement of image rights if Ofo used the student's portrait for commercial purposes, and Ofo would need to pay compensation to the student and face other penalties. Baidu Baike, as an information service provider, would not face any penalties if it deleted the photo as the student demanded, Zhu added."
1,"The impact of ongoing trade friction will not only keep Chinese investors away from the United States, but also lead to a shrinking share in the huge Chinese market for US firms, experts warned on Thursday. They forecast that the uneasy situation will force China to import more products such as automobiles, passenger aircraft, natural gas, crude oil, cotton and medicines from other nations. Their comments came after the New York-based Rhodium Group said in a report on Wednesday that China’s investment in the US totaled $1.8 billion in the first five months of this year, a 92 percent drop year-on-year, and the lowest level in seven years. Chinese investors, in the meantime, completed $9.6 billion worth of divestitures in the US, with another $4 billion of sales pending, according to the report. Another survey carried out by the China General Chamber of Commerce-USA showed that 44 percent of respondents have seen a deterioration in China-US economic and trade relations in 2018. And the same proportion said that a stable and healthy relationship between the two nations is extremely important to the success of their company’s business in the US, according to the chamber’s survey. Chinese companies had invested $140 billion in the US by the end of last year and had created 140,000 jobs mainly in the manufacturing, infrastructure, service, research and development sectors between 2010 and 2017, according to a report jointly released on Tuesday by the National Committee on US-China Relations and the Rhodium Group in April. “Chinese companies have already shifted their focus to European countries and South Korea to seal and seek new opportunities via establishing joint ventures, and merger and acquisition activities,” said Ma Yu, a senior researcher at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation in Beijing. He said China and the European Union, both as the victims of US trade protectionism, comprehensive strategic partners and firm supporters and active participants of multilateral free trade, will certainly increase their FDI in each other’s markets as the negotiation progress of the EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment has been smooth. Aside from investment activities, experts said a trade war would hit US farmers and manufacturers, a vast majority of whom supported Donald Trump in the 2016 election. “Jobs for the Chinese are just as precious as those for the Americans,” said Zha Daojiong, professor of international political economy at the School of International Studies at Peking University. “It will be wise for the two sides to come back to the negotiating table, abide by a temporary agreement and turn down the rhetoric.” Reuters reported that Indian cotton exporters expected the nation’s cotton shipments to China could grow fivefold to 850,000 metric tons in the next crop year as they rack up orders amid trade friction that is forcing China to look for other sources of supply, even though the US is the world’s biggest exporter of the fiber and has been supplying cotton to China for almost a decade. US automakers and US aircraft giant Boeing Co, which have targeted China as a key growth market, are also slated to be hit by the bruising tariffs. US auto giant Ford Motor Co sold 338,386 vehicles in China in the first five months this year, around one-third the number in the US. It had welcomed a Chinese plan to lower tariffs on auto imports, and had even planned to cut prices of its imported Lincoln brand of vehicles. That may be in jeopardy now as a higher import tax is due to be imposed on gas-powered and electric vehicles. Wei Jianguo, former vice-minister of commerce, said this move, once it takes effect, will further push US automobile manufacturers out of the Chinese market, as vehicles from Germany, Sweden, France and Japan have already taken the majority of the country’s medium and high-end vehicle market. US automakers may miss the golden chance to expand their footprint in China, if the Trump administration sticks to trade protectionism and keeps undermining free trade, said Wei. “It is a rare phenomenon that the US is not only having trade disputes with China but also with its allies in the European Union and North America. It appeared that the US is challenging the international trade system which it led to build after World War II,” said Tu Xinquan, director of the China Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International Business and Economics. Because the manufacturing industrial structure of the US and EU is fairly similar, it is unnecessary for China to import more vehicles, passenger aircraft and agricultural products from the US under the current circumstances, he said. Denis Depoux, chief executive officer of Roland Berger China, said bilateral trade tensions have a negative effect on the whole economy, as they create uncertainty, will reduce trade flows and disrupt well established and efficient supply chains. Even more importantly, in many sectors targeted by tariffs such as semiconductors, he said non-European companies including those from Japan or South Korea can also yield higher benefits. And this will only reinforce the determination of the Chinese government and companies to become more independent of global supply chains. Contact the writers at zhongnan@chinadaily.com.cn"

0,"A Henan undergraduate was admitted to a PhD course at the Institute of Mechanics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, to study aerodynamics in Beijing due to his proven ability and creativity. Yan Chang, 21, a senior graduate of the School of Mechanics and Engineering Science in Zhengzhou University, said he had joined a team researching ""a moving model rig for high speed trains"" with professors in Beijing. ""For me, it is also a mind-expanding experience and I am interested in doing research, "" he said. Curiosity is driving his ambition. Wang Xiaofeng, Yan's head teacher in Zhengzhou University, said Yan's ability was outstanding, and he had an excellent team spirit. As a team leader of the robotics laboratory, a technology innovation platform for undergraduates in Zhengzhou University, Yan said the laboratory was their home over the past four years. ""Most of us knew each other and struggled together as freshmen, but we also have 'new blood' joining us. We do experiments again and again, from daybreak to sunrise. We spend most of our summer or winter vocations in the laboratory,"" he said. ""The laboratory witnessed our growth, and we were proud of our camaraderie,"" Yan said with a smile. He and his team won first prize in the 2015 RoboCup final, for underwater robots in Guiyang, capital of southwest China's Guizhou province, competing with about 400 teams from more than 300 colleges around the nation and overseas. ""It is an international contest and has been held annually since 1999 with the idea of advancing the role of artificial intelligence. This competition broadened my horizons,"" he said. Under the leadership of Yan, his team obtained five invention patents and 18 utility model patents, achieving more than 20 national-level scientific and technological innovation awards. Yan has nimble hands even though his middle and ring fingers were joined at birth. Yan was born in a small village of Xinyang, in Henan province. He underwent corrective surgery when he was 4 years old. ""My ability can be dated back to my childhood. When I was young, I would like to take toys apart and see what it was inside,"" he said. A tai chi enthusiast, he said the discipline has helped him see the bigger picture in work and in life. ""Experiments may fail, sometimes, but tai chi gave me a positive mental attitude,"" he added. Chen Hongye, secretary of the Communist Youth League of School of Mechanics and Engineering Science, said openness was good for innovation, and students communicating with other students and professors was a good way to brain storm."
1,"As an integral part of the China-Russia Forum: New Media ? Youth Collaboration, the China-Russia ? Youth Collaboration aims to conduct academic exchanges and promote creative program cooperation among youths from China and Russia. On September 14, five participants gathered at China Daily headquarters in Beijing to take part in the send-off party ahead of the China-Russia ? Youth Collaboration.  The upcoming event, which begins on September 16, will be held in Rostov-on-Don, the biggest city in southern Russia.  A total of 17 top minds have been selected to participate in the event, and they will exchange ideas on topics such as new trends in the internet, network security and new media technology during the eight-day activity. Five Chinese college students - Wei Danyang from Peking University; Lan Juxin form Communication University of China; Wu Yuhong from Jinan University; Jiang Jie from Guangdong University of Foreign Studies; and Zhao Zijian from Tianjin Normal University - will take part in the brainstorming sessions there. One of the highlights of the event will be students working as a team and jointly producing a video clip on the Don River and its culture. Also, the Sino-Russian electronic sports show will demonstrate the competitive and cooperative features in online media.  ""Vigorous and passionate, college students usually have a keen power of observation. I hope they will give full play to their strong points and learn something useful and meaningful through the event,” said Han Lei, editor-in-chief of China Daily Website.  Jiang Jie, a student, said, ""I was a volunteer at the first session of China-Russia Forum last year. This year, I am honored to become a participant, it is a valuable chance for me.” ""I believe the trip to Russia will be an unforgettable experience."" Lan Junxin, another student, said, ""I'm good at making short videos and I'm looking forward to record the beautiful natural scenery and rich cultural life of Rostov-on-Don, and I cherish the chance.” The China-Russia Forum: New Media ? Youth Collaboration, supported by the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television of China and the Russian Ministry of Telecom and Mass Communications, was held in Guangdong province in 2016. Following the success of China-Russia Tourism Year, China-Russia Language Year and the China-Russia Youth Year, the forum is bound to promote fruitful collaborations between the two countries."
0,"As a single-never-married guy, I can now say there comes a tipping point in your relationship with, well, your hometown when you decide ""that's it"" - you'll no longer whine or whinge about its shortcomings or dark side but accept it for what it is with complete resignation or wisdom.  You even discover, and take delight in, its positives or simple pleasures. If you are married to, or irretrievably in love with, a Homo sapiens, you probably know that might-as-well-get-on-with-it feeling.  That feeling dawned over several nights in Beijing, my home for the last two years. Let me propound a theory: If you want to fall in love with your hometown, check it out at night.  You'll forget and forgive the blemishes and the rough edges, or smog or crowded motorways, that the day's light highlights and the night's neon beautifies. Much like...well, you know what I mean.  So, here's my little list of ""all you wanted to love about Beijing but didn't know how"".       Three guys in the 35-50 age-group are hungry around 2 am, after a weekend evening that was a throwback to university days. No problem. Summer's the time to enjoy scrumptious, freshly made, piping hot street food at intersections and on sidewalks. The ubiquitous mobile stalls on three-wheelers and carts are an explosion of flavors: noodles, dumplings, pancakes, omelets, breads and assorted local delicacies that are cooked, stir-fried or steamed. Savor them all without bothering about their names and recipes.   Oh yes, Beijingers love grilled food. The suppliers take care not to violate municipal regulations on burning coal outdoors. The food stalls install the equipment, hobs, chimneys indoors. The veg and nonveg food is served outdoors. Celebrations start after dusk and continue till dawn presumably.   I am yet to figure what, exactly, this army of e-bike-riders in sleeveless jackets does after midnight. They zip past you with receipt book in pocket, and seem to zero-in on wrongly parked vehicles. They display enormous enthusiasm for their work, and are an inspiration.   In size, they are as large as, or perhaps larger than, an airport's tarmac, but these days (rather nights), they get transformed in a jiffy, much like girls who grow up too fast and turn into lovely brides right before your eyes. This ability to upgrade key infrastructure overnight is amazing.   The after-dusk Beijing skyline is a sexy beast. Familiar skyscrapers are draped in glitzy, sophisticated lights that conjure dynamic colors, wavy patterns and sleek shapes. Not exactly a novelty, but they still take your breath away. The best views can be had from a moving vehicle on an overpass.   Hectic construction means gigantic cranes, and aluminum ladders are suspended at impossible heights and angles. The background of night sky and artificial light create a weird geometry that can produce Zen moments.   Convenient, reliable; available always. Didi rocks.   Seriously. Streets, arteries and ring roads throb. Even between midnight and dawn, you'll feel reassured you're never alone in Beijing.

1,"World-leading technology was on display as an expo opened on Saturday to get things warmed up for this year's 4th World Internet Conference in Wuzhen in Zhejiang province. The four-day Light of the Internet Exposition has attracted participants from across the world to the Wuzhen International Internet Exhibition and Convention Center. ""The expo features the most innovative, cutting-edge products and fields in information technology, including cloud calculation, big data, quantum communication, artificial intelligence, and the shared economy,"" Yuan Jiajun, governor of Zhejiang province, said at the expo's opening ceremony. More than 400 companies－100 more than last year－are attending from 13 countries and regions. They include not only industry giants such as BMW, Kaspersky, Alibaba and Tencent but also startups that are leaders in some areas of information technology. IFly Tek, a top company in voice recognition, showcased its Xiaoyi Translation Machine at the expo, which attracted a lot of visitors on the expo's first day. ""The machine can be put in a pocket and connected to the internet with a cellphone SIM card,"" said Liu Weiwei, marketing manager of iFly Tek. Even before the device was launched this year, the company had introduced automatic translation between some languages. The company's products also have been used for simultaneous interpretation at conferences. Bermal Kaplan, a representative for Hangzhou Tiankuan Technology Co, a security terminal producer for industrial and defense applications, said her company's products have been of great help to countries along the Belt and Road Initiative. ""China's internet technology is at least a decade more advanced and convenient than in my home country,"" said Kaplan, who is from Turkey. ""I feel like I am living in the future."" Some companies are newcomers, such as Buick, a division of manufacturer General Motors of the United States and one of world's oldest automakers. ""China has the world's leading ecosystem for internet connectivity,"" said Sam Silverman, a Buick representative. ""Many countries are still in the desktop age, yet China seems to have leapfrogged into the mobile age, and now everything can be done using smartphones in China,"" he said. ""Couple that with strong government support and infrastructure and these advantages will definitely help China's smart vehicle industry flourish."" Ofo, a leading bike-sharing company based in Beijing, was present and also has been working on new technology to benefit customers. ""We are trying to make things even easier,"" said Li Bofei, a business manager for the company. Ofo, working with Huawei Technologies Co, has introduced a smart bicycle lock that can be unlocked with a smartphone using near-field communication technology, which is ""even easier than scanning a QR code"", Li said. Business and technology are advancing rapidly in China, Li said. ""Perhaps a new internet approach just created last year might now be considered a traditional one."" At last year's expo, We Doctor Group showed off a smartphone application permitting a user to connect with an online medical care service, smart medical devices and home appliances. This year, the company is exhibiting a smartphone it developed with a button on the back to make things simpler and easier for elderly users who have trouble with regular smartphones. It allows them to connect to the company's internet hospital platform, which it developed in late 2015, and also has all the functions of a regular phone, said Hou Dan, a marketing manager from We Doctor."
0,"Canadian scholar and advocate of Confucianism Daniel A. Bell receives the Huilin Cultural Award. Wang Kaihao reports. His Chinese name is Bei Danning, which is based on the pronunciation of his English name, but it also indicates ""simplicity and tranquility"" in Mandarin, paying homage to ancient Chinese sages. Daniel A. Bell is the dean of the School of Political Science and Public Administration at Shandong University in Jinan, a rare post on the Chinese mainland for foreigners. Still, the Canadian political theorist and philosopher, who's best known for his studies on China, wants to be treated by locals as a ""Chinese"". Not to mention that he is married to one. ""It's about culture, not race,"" Bell, 54, says in Mandarin during a recent visit to Beijing Normal University. ""If foreigners who are not of Chinese ethnicity can come to appreciate that learning about Chinese culture is not just a hobby or a skill to help in business, but a matter of identity,"" he says, ""then it can enrich our minds and fundamentally change the way we lead our lives."" In late January, he received the Huilin Cultural Award, an annual prize of Beijing Normal University given to both Chinese and foreign scholars who make extraordinary contributions to Sino-foreign cultural communication. ""That (shared culture) was a traditional understanding of what it means to be a Chinese,"" Bell says. ""It will be healthy for both China and the rest of the world to revive it and reinterpret it in modern times."" He credits the open-mindedness to history－China embraced people from overseas as early as in the Tang Dynasty (618-907). ""Some of the values in mainstream Chinese culture had been deliberately marginalized since the 19th century for bad reasons,"" he explains. ""It was just because China then didn't have as much economic and political power as Western countries, and these values were viewed (by the West) as maverick,"" he says. ""But they should be promoted for social and philosophical reasons as China's economic and political power is rising nowadays."" Born in Montreal and educated at McGill and Oxford, Bell, an advocate of Confucianism, has continued research on that ancient Chinese philosophy in the past 20 years or so by visiting and teaching at institutions such as Princeton University in the United States, Tsinghua University in Beijing, the National University of Singapore and the University of Hong Kong.,In 2016, he accepted the invitation from the university in Shandong province, the original center of Confucianism. The province's Qufu city was the birthplace of Confucius, a philosopher and educator of the Spring and Autumn Period (770-476 BC). Bell says while there has been a growing interest among foreigners in learning the Chinese language, most of them are doing so for business. And, now, when China is making efforts to revitalize its cultural self-confidence, he wants to help people more comprehensively understand this country. ""As a known Canadian philosopher on comparative politics, he has focused on the studies of Confucianism and has written many treatises on Chinese culture and social politics,"" says Wang Song, deputy director of the education, science, culture and healthcare department at the State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs. Wang attended the award ceremony at Beijing Normal University in January. According to Wang, Bell's works have been published in 23 languages. ""He has sincere emotions about Chinese culture,"" Wang says. ""His in-depth studies have made an extraordinary contribution to help our culture go global."" Bell says he does not know if he deserved the prize but adds that a lot of work remains to be done in this field. He points to the difficulties of promoting Chinese culture overseas. ""Promotion of sophisticated forms of Chinese culture is a long-term project,"" he says. ""If it becomes vulgarized and homogenized, we will have failed at our task."" Bell does not want to scratch the surface. So he has picked an angle, which is less metaphysical but probably more challenging as well. In his book, The China Model: Political Meritocracy and the Limits of Democracy, which was first published in 2015, he favors China's meritocracy, which echoes ideas in Confucianism, over the one-person one-vote system in selecting a country's political leaders. He has faced criticism from some Western scholars, probably because his statement differs from what they have taken for granted. ""I think it's a problematic view to think there is only one legitimate way to select political leaders,"" Bell says. ""There are different possibilities, decided by the country's size, history and the public's needs.,""Meritocracy is where mainstream political culture is in China, which is large and complex."" Consequently, he emphasizes the importance for the modern world to ""respect the differences"". ""I don't think any philosophy per se can solve problem,"" he says. ""But values in Confucian traditions are helpful to think of issues more efficiently."" For example, according to traditional Confucianism, social relations should be in a form of peaceful order, and diversity coexists with harmony. He believes these ideas can resonate among many cultures. He hails China's efforts to cut poverty and improve this kind of harmony. And, for foreigners who want to know fundamentals of Chinese politics today, he still recommends ""classics"" first. ""Most of the greatest works were done in the Spring and Autumn Period,"" he says. ""It's important to read (Confucian) classics starting with Confucius, Mencius and Xunzi."" Both Mencius and Xunzi were followers of Confucianism in the later Warring States Period (475-221 BC). ""But it should also include their critics like the so-called legalists as well as other mainstream schools. The books are still on the subjects we need today."" Separately, speaking of the revival of traditional culture in China in recent years, which has led to Confucian institutions and academies mushrooming all over the country, Bell thinks the trend is positive as long as ""there are different interpretations"". ""It will be bad to say 'This is what Confucianism means, and other interpretations are disallowed',"" Bell says. ""It's a good thing if there are more diverse expressions of Confucianism and other Chinese philosophies flowering all over China."""
0,"Iranian director Majid Majidi talks about his filmmaking at a master class in Beijing, Xu Fan reports. Iranian director Majid Majidi is known for making films centered on children. His 1997 classic, Children of Heaven-about two young siblings who share a pair of tattered sneakers-was the first Iranian film nominated for an Oscar in the best foreign language category. His other acclaimed films include The Color of Paradise, a best feature winner at the Montreal World Film Festival in 1999, Baran (2001) and The Willow Tree (2005). During his recent visit to Beijing, Majidi revealed how he manages to bring out the most natural on-screen emotions in his young actors and actresses-by ""cheating"" a little as well. ""I wrote another script for the children, but they didn't know in advance,"" Majidi, 59, said in Persian of Children of Heaven at a master class organized by the China Film Foundation's Wu Tianming Film Summit for Young Talents, which was held in Beijing from Nov 4 to 9.,He says he set up a ""trap"" for Amir Farrokh Hashemian, who stars as 8-year-old Ali in the same film, and Bahare Seddiqi, the actress who plays Ali's younger sister, Zahra. In the film, which also won the best picture award at the Montreal World Film Festival in 1997, Ali is from a poverty-stricken family in Tehran. One day, he loses a pair of pink shoes-his sister's only footwear. Fearing that their father would blame him, the siblings decide to take turns wearing Ali's pair of sneakers to go to school. But a string of mishaps makes the situation worse. It was the first film for the two child actors, Hashemian and Seddiqi, who were selected from a number of elementary school students in Tehran. They had to show anger, joy and desperation, among other emotions. ""But the children would be nervous in front of a camera. It's natural. You cannot be too demanding,"" says Majidi. So, the director pretended to scold an assistant for ""carelessness"" at work and told him that he was fired. As the assistant's regular job involved taking care of the two children, they felt sad and cried. Hashemian walked toward Majidi, asking the director to forgive the assistant. Majidi nodded as if he was reluctant but agreed. ""He (Hashemian) was so excited and promptly jumped. The child quickly ran to the assistant and stopped him from 'leaving'. At that moment, you could see that the child thought it was a great thing,"" recalls Majidi. But the children didn't know that the cameras were rolling, recording their emotions, which were edited to become formal content in the film. ""Of course, you cannot do such things for all scenes. You still have to correctly teach them (child artists) to induce emotions,"" says Majidi.,He says he shoots what he really needs during rehearsals, as children are more relaxed and natural than when they perform officially. Majidi, who's also a father of two children, says traveling with the young cast is his other way to get into their world. Before shooting The Color of Paradise, which was listed by Time Magazine as one of the 10 best movies of 2000, the director toured with Mohsen Ramezani, who stars the protagonist-a boy who's blind-to northern Iran's water bodies and forests. ""He is more sensitive to hearing and touch than people (without sight disabilities). I wanted to know how he feels and experiences the world,"" recalls Majidi. It turned out to be quite a journey. Young Ramezani listened to the breeze and birds in the woods and grabbed sand on a beach-experiences he described as listening to the ""languages of nature"" to the director. ""I felt like I was blind, too, but that Ramezani's vision was stronger. The travel was very inspirational and had opened my heart to the authentic beauty of nature,"" says Majidi. Born in a middle-class family in Tehran, his fascination with acting and the stage started at 11 years old. His interest in cinema grew after the Iranian Revolution of 1979. His latest film is Beyond the Clouds, a 2017 Hindi-language feature that marks his first production outside Iran. Set in Mumbai, the film is about adult siblings and has child characters, too.,""A Chinese distributor has purchased it. I hope Beyond the Clouds will be released in China next year,"" says Majidi. Majidi was once invited as one of five foreign masters to shoot a five-minute promo for the 2008 Beijing Olympics. He says he has since shaped an idea about depicting the conflict between a Chinese boy and his grandmother, who respectively represent yearning for a modern life and the persistence of tradition. ""I have been thinking about the script and polishing it for a decade. I'm talking to some Chinese filmmakers and hope I can shoot the story in China,"" says Majidi. ""Iran and China share a lot of similarities in culture. China has a huge film market. I expect more cooperation in cinema."" Contact the writer at xufan@chinadaily.com.cn"
1,"Many people quit their jobs to plunge into business and make money after China's reform and opening-up policy was launched in 1978. The wave of small startups spread to Mudanjiang, in northeastern China's Heilongjiang province, which shares a border of about 200 kilometers with Russia, and many have prospered on cross-border trade. Yang Shixin, a 51-year-old from Suifenhe, a city that forms part of Mudanjiang, owes her fortune to the policy. Suifenhe, just 190 km from Vladivostok, the largest harbor city in the Russian Far East, has become the bridgehead for Sino-Russian trade. Civil trade markets, where individuals from the two countries could barter goods, opened there in the 1980s, and Russians flooded in to exchange goods with Chinese in the 1990s, when the markets were flourishing. ""In 1991, for the first time, I gave a box of underwear in exchange for a piece of woolen cloth at the Sino-Russia trade center,"" Yang said. ""Then I sold the woolen cloth for 100 yuan to Chinese buyers, while the underwear cost me just 5 yuan. I earned my first profit and it was unimaginable because my salary as a saleswoman at the then State-owned supply-marketing cooperative was 84 yuan a month."" Yang visited the trade center nearly every day after that ""incredible"" experience. ""In the 1,000-square-meter outdoor barter trade center, Chinese stood behind counters that formed circles, from inside out, and Russians gathered inside the circles to exchange goods such as coats and Russian nesting dolls,"" she said. ""To enter the center and use a counter, we needed to buy tickets, usually priced 5 to 10 yuan, from the industrial and commercial administration."" The tickets went on sale at 3 am and demand was so high that Yang had to wait in line from 11 pm to make sure she got one. She also needed to find time to trade after work. In 1993, despite opposition from her family, she quit her job, which they regarded as an ""iron rice bowl"" with guaranteed employment and good benefits, to start her own underwear business, which made her about 60,000 yuan a year. By 2006, her annual profit had increased to about 1 million yuan, and she was able to buy a 90-square-meter apartment in Beijing.,Zhao Guodong, deputy director of Mudanjiang's commerce bureau, said materials were scarce during the planned economy period and goods did not have prices. So when the market began to open up, traders could easily sell at a good price and make a fortune. ""China and Russia had complementary needs,"" he said. ""We sold light industrial products to them while they supplied us with natural resources. Today, barter trade doesn't exist; sizable companies prosper instead. Counterfeits have been effectively banned and the markets have become more regulated."" Mudanjiang now has four major ports - an airport in the city, a highway and a railway port in Suifenhe and a highway port in Dongning. They have a combined cargo capacity of nearly 40 million metric tons a year and can transport 22 million people a year, according to the city government. There are now 558 companies in Mudanjiang trading with Russia, and the city's exports and imports totaled 19.25 billion yuan ($2.77 billion) last year, 16.97 billion yuan more than in 1993. Crude oil and timber accounted for more than 70 percent of imports from Russia, while shoes and machines made up nearly 80 percent of exports. However, international trade can be easily affected by changing policies and global conditions, something Chen Xiangzhou, the chairman of Suifenhe Friendship Wood Industry Co, who has traded with Russia for 18 years, is deeply aware of.,Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 saw the European Union and the United States impose sanctions on Russian banks and firms, including its state-owned oil companies and arms manufacturers. Russia responded by banning food imports from EU countries and the US. While it was good news for grocers in China, it was not good news for Chen. ""The sanctions resulted in the collapse of the rouble and the country's financial crisis,"" he said. ""Russians reduced their consumption, and those who exported clothes and cars there all sustained losses. ""Now, we're concentrating on our original business - importing timber from Russia and selling it at home and abroad. It turns out it has become a pillar industry in our city."" Chen said the city's timber imports had risen by an average of 1 million cubic meters a year over the past five years. ""This is the best time for the two countries,"" he said. ""Russia has resources and we have processing skills and facilities. Russians are all careful not to 'drain the pond to catch the fish', so they don't worry about the depletion of natural resources."" Yu Hang, deputy manager of Huasheng Guoyun Logistics, said the harbor in Vladivostok is a gateway for Mudanjiang to explore more commercial opportunities. ""The overland distance from Mudanjiang to Russia's harbor is much shorter than to other harbor cities in China,"" he said. ""Since marine transportation is far cheaper than inland routes, we would cut the costs substantially if we shipped goods via Vladivostok harbor to Chinese cities. ""In that case, products from not only Mudanjiang but also nearby areas such as Harbin, in Heilongjiang, and Jilin province could be sold in a more convenient way. ""Moreover, we could ship goods to Japan, South Korea and Western countries via Russia's port. The transport pattern has been put into regular use since 2012. It is not yet large-scale, but it will be a trend."""
0,"Beijing's vehicle testing centers have been warned that they could lose their licenses if they fail a new annual inspection, part of an improved supervisory system to be rolled out on Thursday. Three city departments, including the Environmental Protection Bureau, issued regulations earlier this month to increase oversight of the centers and remove more polluting cars from roads to help improve air quality. Inspections will now be carried out annually at 35 centers in Beijing, with each center receiving a score based on the number of rule violations it discovers. The best score is zero, while the worst allowable is 12. ""We will not let vehicles that exceed emissions standards to go on the road,"" Ma Li, director of meteorology for the Beijing Administration of Quality and Technology Supervision, said on Monday. ""The new grading system gives clear direction to the testing centers about the major issues."" The regulation says any center that falsifies data will receive a score of 12 points, which will lead directly to the suspension of its business license. The testing centers will also be scrutinized for how stringent and consistent they are in checking vehicles for environmental compliance, among other areas of concern. ""The supervision and inspection institutions will need to conduct self-inspection and improvement for recorded points,"" Ma said. ""During one period, an institution that accumulates up to 12 points also needs to do a self-inspection."" In 2017, the capital had made significant progress in improving its air quality by reducing major airborne pollutants and achieving national air quality goals. Last year, Beijing had 226 days with excellent or good air quality (an air quality index reading of 100 or lower) 50 days more than in 2013, according to the environmental protection bureau. ""Environmental inspection is an important way to make sure vehicles in Beijing meet emissions standards to reduce the city's air pollution,"" said Lian Aiping, deputy director of the motor vehicle emission management department at the bureau. ""The regulation is also to make certain that the emissions of vehicles in daily life maintain factory standards."" The local government also curbed car emissions to reduce pollution, and implemented a new license plate lottery policy at the end of last year to reduce the number of new plates available to car buyers. The first vehicle plate lottery result in 2018 that was released on Monday showed the winning rate was only 0.05 percent - a record low that demonstrates the difficulty of owning and operating a vehicle in Beijing. The quota for vehicles using new energy in 2018 is 54,000, with about 150,000 applicants awaiting their notifications. xinwen@chinadaily.com.cn"
1,"With financial institutions increasingly employing roboadvisers, China's central bank and financial regulators issued draft regulations for comment recently, requiring financial institutions to receive regulatory approval for offering such services.  The regulatory authorities said financial institutions should create rational investment strategies and algorithm models, as well as remind investors of the flaws and risks associated with algorithm-based robo-advisory models.  Financial institutions are also required to report to the regulators the principal parameters of their advisory models and the main logic behind their asset allocation.  The draft regulations come at a time when a growing number of financial institutions, including commercial banks, securities firms and fintech companies, have started to explore robo-advisory services in wealth management.  Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd, the country's largest State-owned commercial lender by assets, announced on Nov 13 that it recently launched a robo-advisory service called ""AI Investment"".  Personal clients of ICBC can take an investment risk tolerance assessment on its mobile banking platform. Based on the assessment results, the bank will recommend to each client an investment portfolio composed of six types of investment, such as bonds, securities and money market funds, and tell the client the simulated annualized rates of return during different investment periods.  The client will then make investment decisions based on the recommendation of ICBC, which sets the robo-advisory investment threshold at 10,000 yuan ($1,508), and adjusts their investment portfolio according to the latest investment situation in financial markets.  Since AI Investment started trial run on Aug 22, the annualized rates of return of its 15 investment portfolios ranged from 3.14 percent to 14.59 percent, according to ICBC. The robo-advisory model developed by the bank will analyze the data reflecting macroeconomics, industries, fundamentals of listed companies, and market performance and risk.  Before ICBC introduced robo-advisers, China Merchants Bank Co Ltd, a nationwide joint-stock commercial lender with a strong foothold in retail banking, launched a similar service in December 2016.  The bank's robo-advisory system analyzes more than 3,400 public funds to draw a risk-benefit curve that suits the investment goals and risk tolerance level of each client.  Tian Huiyu, president of China Merchants Bank, said the bank will push ahead with changes to its input-output model through the development of financial technologies.  During the process of strategic transformation of commercial banks, advanced technologies like artificial intelligence will be widely used in the financial sector, said senior executives of the bank.  It has invested more than 5 billion yuan a year during the last few years to improve its information technology services. It will further increase investment in technical innovation and establish a fault-tolerant mechanism to build a solid foundation for the development of retail banking, according to Li Jianhong, chairman of CMB.  Non-banks are also eyeing the robo-advisory market. Many securities companies, fintech firms and peer-to-peer lending platforms, which allow individuals to lend money directly to unrelated people and businesses, have launched their own services in this field.  PINTEC Group, a Beijing-based intelligent financial services technology platform, launched a renminbi-denominated robo-adviser in the China market, providing intelligent, customized and automated wealth management solutions to financial institutions and their clients.  Zheng Yudong, CEO of Polaris, the digital wealth-management and robo-advisory subsidiary of PINTEC, said: ""Robo-advisers will help investors avoid financial losses caused by irrational investment behaviors, such as buying the winners and selling the losers, amid market fluctuations.""  By using big data and digital technologies, Polaris will find asset allocation solutions based on real-time market and financial product conditions. Its investment portfolio covers 12 asset categories worldwide, including securities and bonds in mature markets overseas and emerging markets.  ""We have a huge product database and our robots collect a certain fund's market data for calculation every day,"" Zheng said. ""We emphasize long-term performance of a fund, rather than simply highlighting its short-term performance.""  The firm provides robo-advisory solutions to institutional investors, including banks, securities and insurance companies, in addition to individual clients."

Construction on the first stage of the project is due to start in September and be completed in late June next year. The 6.5-kilometer-long bike path starts in Huilongguan in Changping District and runs to Shangdi in Haidian District in southwest Beijing. Future extensions of the bike path may take it into the Zhongguancun tech industry area in southwest Beijing. To protect the safety of riders, electric bikes and other vehicles will be forbidden from using the bike path. Barrier gates will also be installed to prevent other vehicles from entering or blocking the bike path. The six-meter-wide bike path is designed to allow bikes to travel at 20 kilometers per hour, with a capacity of 1,000 to 1,200 bikes per hour per lane. Reversible lanes will be used to help ease traffic jams at rush hour."
0,"A long winter, an isolated Greek island, a stone house, a lonely old man … this is where the story for the song Constant Abstract Arrivals and Constant Concrete Departures began. During the singer-songwriter Lucy Cheung's many travels, she encountered a Dutch man who chose a life of seclusion. Initially intending to start a new life in Greece with his beloved, he started to build this cozy little nest, but by the time the construction finished, the woman was gone. Singing in Cantonese, Cheung relates to her own life experiences and expresses her empathy in this song. The song serves as the title track of Cheung's second album A Maudlin Geometry, released by Modernsky Entertainment, a Beijing-based record company. Born in Guangzhou, Guangdong province, in 1979, having lived in Beijing for 10 years, currently based in London and frequently traveling to other parts of the world, Cheung writes songs in multiple languages-Cantonese, English and Mandarin. While rooted in folk, her music is influenced by the various styles she was exposed to while growing up. ""I have been very significantly influenced by classical music. I remember when I was little, everyday, my father would play classical music cassettes or turn on the radio,"" Cheung says. Another major influence comes from the world of jazz. ""I started to listen to a lot of jazz music when I was in high school, influenced by a radio program in Guangdong. Everyone in China knows about the heavy assignments you get given by school right before you enter university, but I found this radio station. It was my oasis, my darling, my little place of escape."" For this new album, Cheung participated in the arrangement of each song. She also recorded all of the classical guitar accompaniment and some of the electric guitar tracks.,As a child, she was enchanted by a toy guitar she had when she was only 3 years old. Then, in the next year, she got her first real guitar. ""I always call my guitar my soul mate. I'm sometimes hurt by people, but my guitar has never betrayed me. It's always there. I can just hold it in my arms and express myself through my guitar, and then I heal myself,"" Cheung says. However, she chose songwriting as a career instead of becoming a professional musician, a lifestyle that allowed her more time to travel and explore. She kept on writing and recording songs, and released her first album, Post Teen, in 2016. For Cheung, music is a private space, where she does not have to make compromises. In 2006, Cheung first visited the island of Kos in Greece, which she calls ""the edge of the world"", before moving and living there between 2010 and 2012. ""It's very clear, very pure. The house I lived in at that time had no neighborhood, and was very close to the sea, so I sort of had my own private beach,"" Cheung says. The majority of the songs on the new album were written during her stay in Greece, with a self-reflection during that phase of her life. So far, the songs have received positive comments from Cheung's listeners. One user of music streaming app, Xiami, named ""Porsia,"" says: ""(Her) music and voice are both mesmerizing."" Another listener, ""Dabuyang,"" says Cheung has ""extraordinary personal style, incredible guitar skills"", and is ""the most wonderful surprise of the year"". In September, A Maudlin Geometry was selected among the ""editor's picks"" on Apple Music, and Cheung performed her first British gig at The Water Rats pub, a well-known live music venue where the likes of Bob Dylan, The Pogues and Oasis made their London debut. Cheung has planned a Chinese tour, beginning in March and taking in the cities of Tianjin, Beijing and Changsha in 2019. She has also vowed to continue writing, composing and traveling her way through the year."

0,"At 8:38 am Friday, a train with about 350 passengers left from southwest China's Chongqing Caiyuanba Railway Station, marking the Lanzhou-Chongqing line's official opening to traffic. The 886-kilometer long railway connects Chongqing with Lanzhou, the capital city of the northwestern province of Gansu. The project, started in 2008, is the country's third main transportation line, after the Beijing-Shanghai line and Beijing-Guangzhou line. The railway, which cuts travel distance between the two cities by about 650 kilometers and travel time from 21 hours to 12, will greatly boost the economy in the less-developed counties of inland China. Thirteen counties on the official list of impoverished areas are situated along the line. Though the counties boast an abundance of cash crops such as Sichuan pepper, walnut and herbal medicines, local farmers found it hard to transport produce out of the mountainous areas, forcing them to seek jobs elsewhere.  The new line is expected to cut the transportation costs by more than 70 percent, according to China Central Television. The line will also integrate with existing railways. To the south, it connects with the Chongqing-Guiyang railway, forming a north-south artery. To the northwest, it will be integrated into the Chongqing-Xinjiang-Europe railway, linkingChongqing with European countries.  Due to the complicated geographic conditions along the way, this project is said to be the most difficult one in China's rail history. A total of 226 tunnels and 396 bridges are required to pass through the mountains and rivers, most notably the Qinling Mountains. The line also traverses a host of fault zones.  As more than 72 percent of the line is bridges and tunnels, safety is the most important issue during operation, said Tian Yu，a conductor who has been working on the railway for 20 years. ""When passing through the tunnels, negative wind pressure can easily hurt the people who stand at the junction of the two carriages,"" he said. ""Our staff need to pay more attention to educate the passengers."""
0,"Unfavorable meteorological conditions and more pollutants spewed from factories whose production restrictions were lifted after the heating season are to blame for the recent extended haze in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, experts said. Beijing issued a blue alert for air pollution on Sunday and Monday. It was the third air pollution alert for the city in about 20 days. An orange alert for air pollution was issued twice in March. Under China's four-tier alert system, red is the most severe, followed by orange, yellow and blue. Emissions of air pollutants in the region remain high, with the dominance of heavy industry and chemical manufacturing, according to the National Joint Research Center on Air Pollution Causes and Control. ""Though air pollutant emissions from heating have decreased a lot after the heating season ended in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei cluster, many of the companies whose production was restricted have resumed normal operations, resulting in an obvious increase in air pollutants from industrial sources,"" the center concluded, based on expert analysis. Air pollution is especially severe during the heating season in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region because of the use of coal. While the region has replaced a great deal of coal with clean energy, it also resorted to production restrictions during the season to curb emissions. In Hebei province, for example, steel factories in some cities are restricted to half capacity during the season. Additionally, the operations of all companies listed as polluting the air are also restricted or suspended during times when atmospheric conditions contribute to the accumulation of heavy pollution. The regular heating season in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region runs from Nov 15 to March 15. This year, heating supplies were extended to March 20 for some cities because of cold weather. The statement said part of the reason for the frequent bouts of air pollution is that meteorological conditions turned unfavorable for dispersal, which is common as the season shifts to spring. One of the main reasons for the frequent smog after March is unfavorable meteorological conditions that feature a stable atmosphere and high humidity, said Ma Xuekuan, chief forecaster at the National Meteorological Center. He said the number of days with meteorological conditions that feature low wind, high humidity and temperature inversions－which prevent normal convective churn of the atmosphere－increased from nine days last year to more than 20 days this year during the same period. Even as temperature inversions have made the vertical dispersal of pollutants difficult, low wind speeds have prevented horizontal dispersal, he said. Meanwhile, the high humidity in the ground layer of the atmosphere is favorable for the concentration of PM2.5. He said pollution that has blown in from nearby regions has also worsened the situation."
0,"BEIJING -- China will push for legislation on pre-school education to a provide legal guarantee for the operation and management of such institutions, Vice Minister of Education Tian Xuejun said Thursday.  Tian made the remarks at a press conference organized by the State Council Information Office, with regards to a child abuse case at RYB Education New World Kindergarten in Beijing that received widespread attention last week.  Tian said the ministry was already doing research on the legislation.  ""The ministry will also complete the requirements on qualifications of teachers engaged in pre-school education and is considering formulating a code of ethics for them,"" Tian said.  He also mentioned a plan to step up supervision of kindergartens and solve the problem of insufficient resources for pre-school education.  A female teacher was detained Saturday on suspicion of child abuse at a Beijing kindergarten, according to local police.  Beijing police said the teacher surnamed Liu, 22, was detained on suspicion of child abuse at the RYB Education New World kindergarten in Chaoyang District.  Police said they had not found evidence the children had been sexually molested.  Tian said the case exposed the conflict between public demand for pre-school enrollment and insufficient development of pre-school education.  ""It also showed that some local authorities and kindergartens still have problems of unsound management and failure to implement or fully implement regulations,"" he said.  Since 2010, the gross enrollment rate for the three years of pre-school education rose to 77.4 percent from 50.9 percent, he added."
0,"A TV series loosely based on the ""Two Bombs, One Satellite"" project, China's nuclear and space program, recently began airing on Beijing Satellite TV and the video streaming site Tencent Video. The 43-episode series,  directed by Han Xiaojun, is about a group of friends, who go from fresh college graduates to established engineers at a rocket research center in Southwest China. The story, spanning three decades, starts with China's successful detonation of its first atomic bomb in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region on Oct 16, 1964, goes on to depict the turbulence of the 1970s and the huge changes brought about by the reform and opening-up policies. Tie Fo, the producer, who has been in the television industry for more than 30 years, says he first read the script in 2007. ""It was penned by Huang Jian, who previously worked in a Guizhou rocket research center,"" he recalls in a telephone interview with China Daily. Tie had once worked in Sichuan province's Mianyang Science and Technology City, a national defense facility, and he identified with the story. Recalling his days there, Tie says he sometimes met with Deng Jiaxian, who was often hailed as the ""Father of China's Nuclear Program"". ""But Deng's identity was top secret then, so I didn't know how important he was. He was very low-profile and easy-going,"" recalls Tie.,Speaking about the plot of the series, Tie says that as the original story had a tragic ending and unfolded a bit slowly, he sent the story to other writers to be revised. He finally approved the version rewritten by Wang Zhili, known for  which looks back on Beijing's hutong lifestyle. Meanwhile, the producers of The Glory and the Dream also acquired footage of missile launches from the 1960s and the 1970s, from a number of sources, including the China Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio, to lend a touch of authenticity to the series. Veteran actor Yang Shuo and actresses Su Qing and Lian Shumei play the lead roles in the series. The drama was shot in Sichuan province at several locations which were once factories manufacturing components and parts for rockets and missiles. ""We also created a lot of props - including several lifesize replicas of missiles - which were transported by 12 trucks to a warehouse covering an area of more than 1,000 square meters,"" says Tie. Separately, he says that most of the major characters are based on real-life people. For instance, the character of Minister Qiao is based on Qian Xuesen, a prominent aerodynamics and cybernetics expert who is regarded as the ""Father of China's Space Program"". When asked if there were concerns that this theme may not be popular with youngsters, who often prefer fantasy or historical dramas, Tie says he believes any work that reminds people of one of the most import chapters in Chinese history will never be ""outdated""."

1,"Pursuing high-quality consumption has become a trend and consumers of all age groups prefer high-quality restaurants of more influential brands, as a result of consumption upgrading in the food service industry, a report said. Members of the post-1970 and post-1980 generations prefer local cuisine and dinners with a higher unit price, while milk tea and drinks are favorites of the post-1990 generation, according to the 2019 Beijing Food and Beverage Consumption Trend Report as reported by the Beijing News. The report is based on a sample study of food and beverage consumption in five business areas in Beijing - Wangfujing, Guomao, Zhongguancun, Shangdi and Wangjing - between 2018 and April 2019. Chinese fast-food outlets are the most in number among the five areas, accounting for 11.92 percent of all food and beverage outlets, but Western fast-food outlets are the most active ones due to high digitalization and being easier for takeout, the report said. The study also found out that many businesses focused on local specialty snacks are transforming to fast-food businesses to adapt to people's fast living pace. Male consumers contributed to 52.9 percent of takeout orders in Beijing, compared with female consumers, who placed 47.1 percent. About 96.6 percent of takeout orders were made for one person, which sends an important signal to food and beverage enterprises. Many companies adjusted corporate strategy by promoting ""small portion"" takeout products as one of the measures to improve efficiency in takeout food operations. The food and beverage revenue in Beijing saw a 7.3 percent year-on-year increase to 110.18 billion yuan ($15.96 billion) in 2018 and it reached 37.33 billion yuan, up 6.8 percent year-on-year, in the first four months of this year."
0,"The Chinese population is becoming more scientifically literate, with more people from less developed regions able to understand and use science to solve issues in life and at work, officials said on Tuesday. About 8.5 percent of China's population is now considered scientifically literate, a 2.3 percentage point increase in the last three years, according to the 10th national survey on scientific literacy by the China Research Institute of Science Popularization. The results of the survey were published on Tuesday during the three-day World Conference on Science Literacy in Beijing, which began on Monday. Shanghai, Beijing and Tianjin are ranked as the top three cities, with the ratio of residents who are scientifically literate scoring 21.9, 21.5 and 14.1 percent respectively, the latest survey found. Scientific literacy has been improving across China. The eastern parts of the country have the highest ratio of scientific literacy, reaching 10.8 percent in 2018, a 2.8-point increase over 2015. The relatively less-developed central and western parts of the country are also catching up. Central regions grew from 5.5 percent in 2015 to 8 percent in 2018. The western regions grew from 4.3 percent in 2015 to 6.5 percent in 2018. Seven provinces - Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Shandong, Fujian, Hubei and Liaoning - surpassed the national average. The 10th national survey, conducted from April to June, involved more than 60,000 people aged 18 to 69 across all 31 provincial-level regions of the Chinese mainland, said Chen Gang, executive secretary of the China Association for Science and Technology. The survey evaluated the respondents' understanding of scientific principles, sought their opinions on key science issues and assessed their ability to use science to make decisions and solve problems, he said. Gauhar Raza, former chief scientist at India's National Institute of Science, Technology and Development Studies, said China has made remarkable achievements in promoting scientific literacy - an effort that gained momentum about two decades ago. The Chinese government has been ""consistent in its commitment"" to the support of scientific literacy through policies and the legal framework, he said. In 2002, China created laws dedicated to promoting scientific literacy. Four years later, the State Council issued a document aimed at improving Chinese citizens' scientific literacy for the next 15 years, cementing the popularization of science as a national policy. The document said China would aim to have 10 percent of its population become scientifically literate by 2020. However, experts said there are still substantial gaps between China and developed countries. The inequality in scientific literacy between China's urban and rural population, male and female demographics, and the unbalanced access to quality education, are still major obstacles that need to be overcome to transform China into an innovation-oriented country, they added. Shanghai and Beijing's ratios of scientifically literate population, while among the highest in China in 2018, are still behind the 24.5 percent scientific literacy rate that the United States had in 2004. A survey by EKOS Research Associates in 2013 found that Canada ranked first in scientific literacy, with 42 percent of Canadians able to read and understand newspaper articles detailing scientific findings. The survey also found 11.1 percent of Chinese males are scientifically literate, while 6.2 percent of females are. Urban populations are also much more scientifically literate than rural residents, 11.6 percent to 5 percent. ""China and India both have enormous populations, and government and media need to realize that we cannot turn everyone into a scientist,"" said Raza. Instead, science education should aim to make citizens ""science-tempered"", granting them the vision and knowledge to help build a scientific civilization, he said. Ren Dingcheng, former executive dean of the School of Humanities at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, said the key to improving scientific literacy in China is to improve science curricula across all ages and have capable teachers."

0,"The speech made by President Xi Jinping on Tuesday addressing young people has sparked lively discussions among students and teachers. At a gathering to commemorate the centenary of the May Fourth Movement in the Great Hall of the People, Xi, who is also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, urged the country's youth to uphold Marxism beliefs, follow the Party's leadership and devote themselves to the nation and the people. Zhang Dongjie, a senior at Peking University, said Xi's remarks made him feel that young people should combine personal aspirations with national rejuvenation and devote themselves where there's a need. During a trip Zhang made to Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region in April, he realized that education is still weak in the region and good teachers are in short supply. To help change the situation, he applied to volunteer as a teacher at a middle school in a Xinjiang town after graduation in July. ""My biggest hope for the next year is that more students in my class will achieve better results, enter high school and grow up as contributors to society,"" Zhang said. Yi Zhihao, a doctoral student at the School of Biological Science and Medical Engineering of Beihang University in Beijing, is also a Beihang Lunar Palace 1 volunteer. The volunteer team, having stayed in Lunar Palace 1 — an environmentally contained research facility where occupants simulated long-duration self-contained missions with no outside inputs for 200 days — broke the previous record of 180 days set by researchers in Russia. The team recently won a China May Fourth Medal. ""President Xi has called upon young people to overcome hardships, and that is what our team has been doing,"" Yi said. Qiu Shuiping, Party secretary of Peking University, said the learning institution is proud to be part of history. The university has chosen May 4 as the day to celebrate its founding.

0,"A father in Beijing who sent a helicopter to his daughter's school for a science assignment has triggered heated discussions online. A netizen posted photos on Friday showing students playing near a helicopter parked on a primary school playground. According to the netizen, the helicopter was sent to Fengdan Experimental Primary School in Beijing's Haidian district by the girl's father as part of the school's science festival, for which she was assigned to learn about the working principles of helicopters, Beijing Youth Daily reported on Saturday. The netizen said the child won a prize for the assignment. The father, surnamed Chen, who owns a helicopter tour company, said two of his employees flew the helicopter to the school at the school's invitation. Photos and videos spread on the internet. Some netizens disliked the father's action, believing he was flaunting his wealth, while some praised the father, saying that it provided other students with an opportunity to see a real helicopter up close. ""Most parents do not have the ability to give children such a lesson about helicopters as that father did. Why should we criticize someone who has the ability and would like to share with other children?"" a netizen identified as CHcathrine said on social media. ""It's like students need to have a lesson about films and a parent works at the cinema and has the ability to offer free films to the students,"" the netizen added. ""Other parents should be grateful to the parent and such deeds should be encouraged."" Some netizens expressed doubt that the father had obtained a permit for the flight, as public security authorities in the capital issued a notice on Friday afternoon saying that private ""low, slow, small"" aircraft are forbidden from flying from May 11 to May 16 to ensure safety during the Conference on Dialogue of Asian Civilizations, which is scheduled to kick off on May 15. ""Low, slow, small"" aircraft are those that fly at an altitude below 1,000 meters, have a speed of no more than 200 kilometers per hour and a radar cross-section of no more than 2 square meters. The father told Beijing Youth Daily on Sunday that he had obtained a permit before the flight, and the helicopter arrived at the school and left on May 10, before the deadline set by public security authorities. He added that he accepted the school's invitation because he thought it would help children master knowledge of aircraft."

This came after two Beijing branches of a popular hotpot chain was exposed to have operated in unhygienic conditions. Videos taken by hidden cameras showed rats infested the kitchen, a dishwasher was caked with oily food residue, and a worker tried to fix sewage clog with a soup ladle. The Sichuan Province-based Haidilao hot pot has admitted its management faults in a frank public statement issued Friday, apologizing for the scandal. In recent years, Haidilao took major Chinese cities by storm by its signature spicy Sichuanese hot pot and excellent service. According to its website, Haidilao is operating in about 60 Chinese cities and has expanded to Los Angeles, Singapore, Seoul, and Tokyo, Beijing Food and Drug Administration said the inspection will target both restaurant chains and canteen suppliers. Business licenses, dishwashers, sanitation equipment, measures to keep off pests and diseases are the focus of the inspection.

0,"College students from around the world will learn how to build a community with a shared future for mankind through a summer school at Beijing Normal University. The opening ceremony for the annual philosophy summer school was held at the university on Monday. Thirty-four students from 16 countries and nine from domestic universities will spend two weeks together learning about traditional Chinese philosophy and contemporary China. Wu Xiangdong, dean of the university's school of philosophy, said it is quite relevant for young students from different countries to discuss how to build a community with a shared future, given rising nationalist thinking and trade protectionism in various countries. It is the first time the summer school, now its fourth year, has added the shared future theme to the program - co-hosted by the university and the Confucius Institute Headquarters in Beijing. It also focuses on Confucianism and the concept of seeking harmony in diversity, an idea put forward by Confucius more than 2,000 years ago that can help to solve problems facing the world today, Wu said. Different countries and civilizations are like musical notes, he said. Only by being different can they compose music. Likewise, countries should overcome cultural misunderstandings and conflicts through more exchanges, mutual learning, dialogue and inclusiveness, he added. Traditional Chinese calligraphy and tai chi will also be part of their stay. They will visit famous scenic spots in Beijing, including the Great Wall, the Forbidden City and the National Museum of China. John Major, an independent scholar of Chinese history and a lecturer at the summer school, said that while Confucianism was introduced to the Western world four centuries ago, it is still little understood. The students can serve as ambassadors when they return home to spread the word that Confucianism is still relevant to modern life, he said. Travis Quigley, a student majoring in political science from Tufts University in the United States, said Western philosophy advocates maximizing the interests of individuals, while Confucian teachings emphasize the values of generosity and humanitarianism. The program makes connections between potential future leaders by forging personal and intellectual bonds. People across many nations can help solve disagreements in the way that forming personal friendships can help bring different groups closer, he said. Runeko Lovell, also from the university, said the summer school provides a great opportunity to learn about Chinese culture and philosophy, which is not well-understood in the West. From interactions with students from China and other countries, we can learn how to build a more close-knit and inclusive community, he said, adding: ""The world needs a community with a shared future for mankind more than ever."""
1,"BEIJING - Xiongan New Area, a new economic zone near Beijing, should have a ""world-class transport system"" that is green and smart, a policy advisor said Wednesday.  Transportation in the new area should mainly focus on rail and bus transit options, complemented by bike-sharing and other ""green, advanced and highly intelligent"" transportation options, said Lu Huapu, from Tsinghua University and a member of the expert committee advising the coordinated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region (Jing-Jin-Ji).  Public transportation, parking, traffic management and logistics should all be supported by smart systems, Lu told Xinhua in an interview.  He also suggested smooth and easy transit between Xiongan and the metropolises of Beijing and Tianjin, saying this was essential to attracting high-level talent from those cities and key to the new area's development.  There should be ""seamless connections"" between Xiongan and the airports of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei, Lu noted.  China announced plans to create Xiongan New Area on Saturday, which authorities described as a ""major historic and strategic choice"" that would be ""crucial for the millennium to come.""  The new area, some 100 kilometers southwest of downtown Beijing, is designed to advance coordinated development in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and cure ""urban ills"" such as traffic congestion and air pollution in the capital.  Establishing Xiongan New Area will help with the ongoing drive to transfer ""non-capital"" functions out of Beijing, officials said."
0,"Beijing has eased requirements for social assistance in the hopes of helping more people in need. The new requirements by the Beijing Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau are expected to benefit more than 200,000 people－up from the current 130,000. Under the new program, families who own only one car and have family members with severe diseases can apply for assistance. The car should be used to transport patients to the hospital. Previously, no subsidies were available. The program also allows a family with floor space per person below the city's average to get payments, even if they have more than two houses, said Li Hongbing, deputy director of the bureau. According to the Beijing Statistical Yearbook 2018, the city's average per capita floor space was 34.2 square meters in 2017. The change is a response to the national three-year action plan released by the State Council in June to reduce poverty and boost the economy. The Ministry of Civil Affairs also carried out pilot projects with local civil affair bureaus to better protect low-income families. The special disadvantaged group also benefits from the revised regulations. Severely disabled people in low-income families will be given the minimum living allowance. The allowance, set up in 2007, is an alternative channel that provides money and daily necessities directly to those in need. It is managed by the Ministry of Civil Affairs and local bureaus. The basic living allowance in the capital has been 1,000 yuan ($146) per month since January 2018, according to the municipal Bureau of Civil Affairs. Xu Jiacheng, deputy director of the China Disabled Persons Rehabilitation Association, warned that the implementation of the policy could come with a risk that beneficiaries may not receive the money directly, or that they will get used to welfare payments by the government. ""A regular re-examination is necessary to prevent some benefits from becoming routine,"" he said. The new guideline also stipulates that the consumption of families or individuals who have received social assistance will be examined on a regular basis by the local government, and assistance will be ended when they no longer meet the criteria."
0,"Local officials will be held accountable for any failure in achieving their air pollution targets as the country resolutely moves forward in the blue sky protection campaign, a national political adviser and senior environmental official told reporters on Tuesday, adding that the government was taking the war against air pollution seriously. With a series of measures taken in 2018, China made great achievement in improving its air quality last year. The average density of PM 2.5 in the country fell by 10.4 percent year–on-year. The concentration of the pollutant in Beijing reached 51 micrograms per cubic meter, Liu Bingjiang, head of air pollution control at the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, told a news conference. To achieve that, China has greatly increased the use of clean energies while enhancing the efficiency of coal burning in power generation. Coal covered 59 percent of sources of primary energy consumption in 2018. It’s the first time that the country saw the coverage decrease to less than 60 percent, said Liu. A total of 23,000 coal-fueled small boilers were phased out across the country in 2018. In northern China, over 4.8 million rural households had shifted from coal to clean energies to warm up their homes, he added. Liu said he is confident that China could achieve the target it sets for 2020, which asks for an 18 percent decrease in PM 2.5 density in major cities that have yet to keep the level below 35 mg/cu m. Almost no cities around the world has once managed to reduce PM 2.5 concentration by over 10 mg/ cu m in just one year, but Beijing successfully brought the density down from 73 mg/cu m in 2016 to 58 mg/ cu b in 2017. ""This is a miracle that we have never sees in history,"" he said, adding this shows that the steps the government has taken are efficient and will also contribute to future air pollution control work. He said what also makes him confident is that more than 2,000 leading Chinese experts have been devoting themselves into site investigation over the causes of air pollution in 39 major Chinese cities in Beijing-Hebei-Tianjin cluster. They are drafting tailor-made solutions for each of the cities to facilitate their effort in improving local air quality. Liu said the country saw the PM 2.5 density in some regions increase again in January and February, and some key regions witnessed a deteriorating situation. This occurred partly due to El Nino, which resulted in transportation of water vapor to northern China with help of weak wind, making meteorological conditions favorable for smog generation. Some local governments are now relaxing their effort in pollution control, saying that there should be rest even in a war. ""We have explicitly said we are going to win the blue sky protection campaign. We have no plan to retreat,"" Liu said. ""There is no jesting in the war. We should keep our promise with action and there must be progress. Those who fail will be fully held accountable,"" he said."
