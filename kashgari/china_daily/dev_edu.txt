0	The key to guarding the achievements China and the United States made in the previous rounds of the trade negotiation lies in the mutual recognition that a trade war will be detrimental to both sides and the resolution to the trade disputes requires constructive approach instead of short-sighted threats and tactics, experts said on Monday. The Chinese statement released after the latest round of China-US trade discussions in Beijing was seen as an encouraging sign that positive progress is being made as both sides sought to turn the consensus reached in Washington into concrete actions. Experts also sensed a firm and consistent tone in the Chinese message that the country will continuously push reform and opening-up to resolve the trade issues with the US while emphasizing that the achievements of the negotiations will only be effective on the condition that both sides agree not to engage in a trade war. "Only by agreeing to this common ground can both sides truly implement the consensus reached at the Washington meeting," said Tu Xinquan, director of the China Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. Tu said that Sunday's statement reflected China's consistency with its policies, including further liberalizing its markets and pushing high-quality development which will not only benefit Chinese consumers but also help drive global growth. But he added that it did not mean that China will make unconditional concessions if Washington adopts unilateral threatening measures, including tariff hikes. Wang Zhi, director of Research Center of Global Value Chains at the University of International Business and Economics, agreed that a tariff war will hurt both economies and could lead to the unraveling of the entire complex global trading system with disruption reverberating around the world for years. "If a tariff war is initiated by the US, the economies of two countries will be hurt. US consumer prices would rise and many US companies dependent on trade with China will also be hurt," Wang said. Wei Jianguo, former vice-minister of commerce, said that negotiations require sincerity and trust and the US side¡¯s practical actions will determine whether the results of trade talks can materialize or not. "Since China continues to expand imports from the US, the latter should also make a quick response to issues such as opening its manufacturing and service sectors to China and loosening its control on China¡¯s high technology," he said. Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Monday that the country's door to trade talks is open in principle when asked about when the next round of negotiations with the United States would be. The numerous rounds of trade consultations between China and US indicated the increasing complexity and the longer-than-expected time it may take for both sides to eventually resolve the trade disputes, economists said. "We may still see more concessions and temporary agreements, but the trade negotiation will likely be more bumpy and longer than before," said Wang Tao, chief China economist with UBS Securities.
0	Artificial Intelligence could be the sector where China makes breakthroughs. Vast amounts of data generated by the country's huge internet population, readily available capital and an excellent talent pool are all favorable conditions. Chinese internet companies have a significant advantage in developing technologies that have the potential to benefit a tremendous number of people. For example, there is huge demand for better healthcare information in China. Sogou's cutting-edge AI-powered machine translation technology has already enabled our users to access Chinese translations of high-quality content from authoritative sources such as the US Food and Drug Administration, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the renowned Mayo Clinic. In addition, our AI-enabled smart diagnosis system can help users better understand their illness by responding to queries about their symptoms with high-quality, trusted information. Users are then able to determine which hospital departments they should visit, based on recommendations from our system.  Actually, there are six transformations that have made Sogou China's second-largest search engine and an AI innovator pioneering in natural language processing. Through continuous technological input, Sogou Search was rolled out in 2004 within online news portal Sohu.com. Through product innovation, Sogou Keyboard was launched in 2006. It's now the No 1 Chinese language input software. Through innovation, Sogou created its "input-browser search engine three-stage rocket" business model and acquired users fast, adding more competition to the market and bringing more options for users. Through its spinoff from Sohu.com, Sogou removed system barriers and turned into a separate company. Through a partnership with Tencent, Sogou has gained a firm foothold in the mobile internet era. Through its IPO in the United States, Sogou has gained enough capital to further its advancement in AI. As Sogou grows, it is galvanizing the search market and pushing AI development, which is expected to transform traditional industries.  The advantages of China are threefold. China's vast number of users means that the marginal costs of developing new products and services is reduced, which could lower the entry barrier for companies looking to innovate. Moreover, improvements in China's national infrastructure have resulted in a significant increase in the number of Chinese internet users, now topping 800 million. In addition, Chinese people are dynamic and entrepreneurial. For China, there is still room to improve in terms of fundamental research. However, we are also seeing a marked increase in the amount of spending by Chinese tech companies to support fundamental research, including Sogou. Two papers co-authored by Sogou vice-president Xu Jingfang have been accepted by the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, a highly regarded international conference in the field of natural language processing, attended by the likes of Facebook and Google.  There is no doubt that AI will bring about crucial breakthroughs for China's internet and technology sectors. One of the most important, but difficult, aspects of AI is the ability to process language. As AI is further integrated into traditional industries - for example, the manufacturing, healthcare and financial sectors - it will bring significant benefit in terms of efficiency and added productivity. In addition, investors are aware of the added value that AI can bring, and thus there will be a steady flow of funds to support the further development of AI. This in turn will make AI indispensable, and various AI-enabled technologies will be gradually implemented across all industries.  For me, an obvious answer is natural language processing that will facilitate communications between machines and people. At Sogou, we've worked to accelerate the evolution of searches, from providing results to responding to user queries with better, more accurate answers. In addition, AI-powered machine translation will be a major disrupter in the technology sector and serve as a crucial breakthrough by enabling all users to overcome language barriers. This is incredibly important and embodies Sogou's mission of helping people all over the world to communicate and access information. Most recently, Sogou's AI-powered machine simultaneous interpretation technology provided two-way interpretations in Chinese and English during interviews and news conferences at the China Open tennis tournament held in Beijing from Sept 23 to Oct 7. This marked the first time that AI-powered instantaneous translation has played a key role at an international sports event., Computer chips are expected to make remarkable progress as China sees the significance and the urgency of acquiring the ability to develop chips on its own, amid the complex situation between China and the United States. Many companies have announced their heavy investment and research into computer chips; in the meantime the government is encouraging local companies to put more effort in the field with new policies coming out. As an AI company, we invested in AI chip company Thinkforce in 2017. A self-developed chip will be ready at the end of the year.  In China, you can see how the internet and innovation have profoundly changed and interacted with people's lives in every way. New ideas have been encouraged to emerge, which are soon trialed and then widely used. In this innovation-driven country, most companies are looking for ways to have leading technology and innovation engaged in their business. Automation will be seen in more and more work scenarios, dramatically increasing efficiency and freeing up people from repetitive, dull work to do jobs where their innovation and talent can be applied. All the traditional industries are facing complete reform and upgrading through emerging new technologies.  An internet nation requires the fast development of network infrastructure nationwide, a massive group of people who are active network users and a positive open attitude to new technologies. In over 20 years, China has seen the arrival of well over 700 million active network users who are now in the habit of communicating, shopping and surfing on the internet with their mobile phones. They are open to and demanding of new technologies that can make their lives more convenient. This encourages companies to be innovative, to create new applications or reform traditional industries with new technologies. China has many examples that prove that it has the drive to innovate business models with the help of the internet.  The rapid advancements in internet of things technology are already beginning to shape the cities of tomorrow, and people are benefiting from the substantial improvements. The transformation has been taking off thanks to the growing strong computing ability to collect massive amounts of data and the development of the wireless network. We believe the progress in intelligent healthcare in the past year is worth watching. Yitu has been working with over 100 top-ranked hospitals to apply AI technology to clinical work flows, helping doctors read countless CT scans to make their diagnoses. It benefits both doctors and patients to increase efficiency and have a more accurate diagnosis. In the future, we believe AI's development in healthcare will have a far greater positive impact on more people.  Artificial intelligence has already gained a strong momentum in being applied in people's lives, as well as revolutionizing more and more industries, as its research and development deepens. With the technology improving, AI is gradually increasing its impact on the world as it will be used in more business scenarios. To be specific, we believe natural language processing will be the disrupter - as more research focuses on training machines to understand longer and longer context and dialogue, to fully interact with humans in the future., China is one of the leaders in the global internet arena. In recent years, emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, the internet of things, cloud computing, big data and robotics have opened up vast new potential to bring positive change to people's lives in China and around the world. As a leading global network in the sharing economy, Airbnb embraces new technologies and will continue investing our resources to inspire more innovations that can move us and the entire industry forward. For example, we are currently using AI, machine learning and predictive analytics to look into user behavior, by examining comments, purchases and browsing data, and have used the insights we have gained to adjust our products and operations, helping to provide a better travel experience to both hosts and guests. We have a strong team of engineers who ensure that we continually stay on the cutting edge of technology. In February, Airbnb China launched a dedicated data science team, with team members based in Beijing and San Francisco. The team works closely with Airbnb's global headquarters, which provides strong support in data science for both our domestic and outbound travel businesses.  The internet is one of the new growth drivers of future economic development. The Internet Plus model can be found nearly everywhere in China today, and has become a strong driving force for the transformation of the world's second-largest economy. China is one of Airbnb's most important markets. Our sharing model provides additional revenue streams for hosts and allows guests to explore new areas and contribute to the local economy. We have a long and successful history of working with a wide range of parties - including the Chinese government, businesses and Airbnb users - to jointly promote the healthy development of the sharing economy in China, and we will continue to do so as we develop. We already have memorandums of understanding in place with cities across China including Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Chengdu, Chongqing and Guilin. We will also expand our involvement with local communities to better support our Chinese hosts.  A powerful internet nation is one that embraces innovation, such as the sharing economy. This is where Airbnb sees China's strength. The past four decades have shown that China has a vibrant economic environment that has allowed businesses and industries to flourish. Chinese millennial travelers are the driving force in the travel market, and what they are looking for are unforgettable experiences. Airbnb is increasingly popular with millennials in China and around the world. Today, 80 percent of our user base in China is under 35. They have strong purchasing power and are educated and eager to learn more about the world. This group will soon become the largest segment in Chinese society. In terms of further development and prosperity, it cannot be achieved without the concerted and coordinated efforts of governments, companies, industries and the public. We look forward to being a part of the partnerships that will continue to drive the rapid growth of the internet sector.  The rise of the sharing economy is undoubtedly a major transformation and one that will have far-reaching implications for the future. The strengths of this model are in its ability to optimize and integrate underutilized resources, as well as the direct positive social changes that it can create. For example, the home sharing model applied by Airbnb provides new opportunities for destinations and supports the development of local economies. Airbnb's accommodation marketplace provides access to over 5 million unique places to stay, in more than 81,000 cities and 191 countries and regions. We can see that today, internet technologies are becoming more closely integrated with the sharing economy. As next-generation information technologies - such as the internet of things, cloud computing, big data, artificial intelligence, mobile payment and modern logistics - become increasingly mature, they will provide more solid support for the development of the sharing economy.  I believe that the development of technology always brings with its enormous potential to improve the quality of life. New technologies allow people to access new products or services in a more efficient and convenient way. One of the key trends we are seeing today is the development of technology-enabled platforms that combine both demand and supply to disrupt existing industry structures, such as those we see within the sharing economy. Sharing economy platforms like Airbnb have lowered the barriers for businesses and individuals to create wealth. At Airbnb, we are seeing local hosts and their communities, many in areas untouched by traditional tourism, all benefiting from the development of new technologies, gaining new revenue streams.
1	Overseas students struggle to find paid employment in China, but new regulations and a nonprofit group aim to change that. Zhang Yangfei reports. Prisca Kyalisiima refreshed her email inbox and began scanning the most recent messages. None of them were what she had been waiting for: A response to her application to the World Bank's office in Beijing. Her sent folder was filled with email applications for various jobs, each including a cover letter and tailored resume. Last month, the 27-year-old Ugandan started her sophomore year as a PhD candidate in finance at Beijing's University of International Business and Economics. She needs to attend lectures only two days a week, and she is desperate to land part-time work or an internship to use the rest of her time productively. But her job search has stalled. "I'm a very hardworking person. I'm used to working, not sitting and being idle," she said. "I really want to work at one of the Chinese banks and see how they do things, because I know China is well-known for advanced technology. "This is one thing I'd feel really sorry about if I leave China without having that experience. It's one of my big dreams." She is not alone in her frustration. Foreign students have long complained about the difficulties of finding work in China, before or after graduation. It is a problem local and central authorities are trying to solve by tweaking visa and employment regulations. Some graduates in Beijing have also taken action into their own hands by setting up a group that offers advice and training to overseas students looking for work in China. Foreign students offer a range of possible reasons why they might struggle in the Chinese market. However, the most common reason students give is the fierce competition. Official statistics show 7.95 million university students graduated in 2017. In Beijing alone, more than 230,000 graduates poured into the job market. Ossian Heulin from France, who is working toward a master's in industrial engineering and automation at Beihang University in Beijing, said the sheer weight of applications for jobs and internships at major companies mean it is hard for foreign students to stand out. Although they come across as more outgoing, self-confident and creative, they do not have much more on their Chinese counterparts than perhaps fluency in another language, the 23-year-old said. "Chinese now have most of the skills needed for any part-time job, and the government is welcoming elite workers, those who actually bring high value you can't find in China, so young professionals who are just studying and don't have any expertise do not generate much interest," he added. Universities do offer career advice and other support for international students, but services are far more limited compared with those for Chinese, while the language barrier remains a big hurdle for job seekers. "I think the willingness of universities to help international students still needs to be improved," Heulin said. "It's a need that is being felt by all the people I know and have worked with.",To build his skill set and boost his chances of attracting Chinese recruiters, Heulin started volunteering and has become involved in Beijing's burgeoning startup community. He's now chief innovation officer for Planitworld, a startup dedicated to solving the problems caused by urban waste, and director of Startup Grind University Beijing, which fosters entrepreneurship and helps students understand and seize opportunities in the Chinese market. Both positions are unpaid. He said the experience he gained in those positions quickly led to several companies offering him internships. However, he had them on hold while leading the Business development of BeHive, a nonprofit group that organizes gatherings, workshops and lectures around Beijing for international students looking for work in China. Like Heulin, co-founders Petros Djakouris and Costas Georgiou, two postgraduate students from Cyprus, have been in the same position as the people they aim to assist: They came to China to study, fell in love with the place, and wanted to stay. But they had no idea how to look for work or what the visa requirements were. They went to a career services center for advice, but everything was in Chinese, said Georgiou, 27. "So we decided that with no one giving us the answer, we could organize a community like BeHive so that we could help each other," he said. Georgiou and Djakouris, who both previously studied in the United Kingdom, completed an intensive Mandarin course at UIBE in 2017. Georgiou then joined an international talent program operated by HNA Capital, the Chinese conglomerate, before starting at a law firm, while Djakouris, 26, now does marketing for a technology company. Using the BeHive platform, which was launched in March 2017, they have organized 25 workshops focusing on topics including networking, interviews, intercultural communication and presentation skills. They have also partnered with other organizations and invited professionals, usually experts in presentation and leadership, to give speeches. Professional trainer and consultant Malcolm Nerva has been working with BeHive almost since the beginning and has offered many insights on job hunting. In June, the group organized a self-awareness workshop facilitated by Nerva, pointing out ways to discover one's strengths and weakness through personality assessments. The event took place at Tsinghua University's Schwarzman College and attracted more than 150 people. Past guest speakers have included Andrew Shirman, CEO and founder of the NGO Education in Sight, and Alex Weber, a corporate trainer who has worked for Audi, Lenovo, JD and UNICEF. "They train students for free because they believe in our vision and they can see the lack of career support for students, especially in Beijing," Djakouris said, adding that BeHive has helped over 1,000 students, equipping them with the professional skills needed to find employment. The group is now made up of 30 unpaid volunteers, from countries including China, Russia, Greece, Italy, Kazakhstan and Iran. The plan was to take BeHive beyond simply training job seekers and create a space where people can make friends, have fun and enjoy events, according to its founders. They are inviting more Chinese students to share the resources and hope to team up with job fairs and build closer links with university career centers. In August, the Ministry of Education told China Daily the government had decided to lift its nationwide ban on international students finding paid part-time work. Since 2000, foreign students had only been allowed to get unpaid jobs and internships. The move came after Shanghai and Beijing relaxed local regulations to encourage students to start their career or business in China. Shanghai introduced a pilot program in 2015 that enabled foreign students to launch businesses in the city's Zhangjiang National Innovation Demonstration Zone for up to two years after graduation. The Ministry of Public Security also released a policy in 2016 that cleared the way for foreign students to get paid part-time work or launch a startup at Zhongguancun Science Park, the so-called Silicon Valley of Beijing. Last year, the central government announced that students with postgraduate degrees and those from "prestigious" universities can now obtain work permits immediately after graduation, instead of having to wait a minimum of two years. Zhang Shujun, head of Tianjin University Press, and Feng Baoping, a lecturer at Tianjin University's School of International Education, said in a research paper published in 2014 that allowing foreign students to work is in line with the development of society and will help them become more independent. "It will not only ease their financial burden and improve their understanding of Chinese society, but it will also help them accumulate work experience and strengthen their comprehensive capabilities," the paper said, adding that off-campus work experience should be included in Chinese university programs. Heulin said the new policies will be warmly welcomed by international students, as they will allow them to make money while gaining knowledge. "They are very valuable policies and hopefully they will work out," he said.
0	BEIJING - As US President Donald Trump initiated the tariffs offensive on steel and aluminum in March and planned more on its imports from China, experts and officials have noted that the US move is in violation of the World Trade Organization (WTO)'s principles and would harmed US economy itself. Trump's strategy was to wipe out all commercial agreements signed by Washington after World War II which could lead to unprecedented trade disputes, said Joaquin Infante, the winner of Cuba's national economy prize, in a recent interview. Meanwhile, Trump's contempt for multilateral organizations, such as the United Nations and the World Trade Organization, aims to return to the decades when the US showed off its economic supremacy, according to him. "In a world where globalization is irreversible due to technological development and where multilateral trade prevails, Trump is doing quite the opposite with policies that will harm the American economy," he said. "These tariffs that have targeted China confirm that the Trump administration intends to bypass the WTO's dispute settlement body and unilaterally rely on US law alone regarding the ongoing trade dispute with China," said Jon R. Taylor, a political science professor at the University of St. Thomas in Houston, Texas. "That is a big mistake," he said. WTO rules and regulations were established to provide a global mechanism to resolve trade disputes, he said. The American protective measures severely violate the multilateral trade mechanisms, as well as the WTO, said Andras Inotai, research professor at the Centre for Economic and Regional Studies of the Hungarian Academy of Science's Institute of World Economics. He described the US tariffs move as a "own-goal", noting a sound solution to any trade dispute should be filed at the WTO. The US protectionism measures would backfire on the United States' own economy, Inotai said last month after Trump unveiled his plan to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum. On March 23, the US tariffs move was largely criticized during a WTO meeting in Geneva. The WTO said in a statement that trade representatives of more than 40 members, including the 28 from the European Union (EU), took the floor to warn against US tariff measures, during a meeting of the Council for Trade in Goods. Russia said the new tariffs exceed the bound rates the United States had committed to under WTO rules. It sought further clarification how the measure can be justified under WTO rules. The European Union (EU) does not support measures that would run counter to WTO law, Daniel Rosario, spokesman of the European Commission, told reporters Wednesday on Washington's proposed list of Chinese goods subject to additional 25 percent tariffs based on the investigation of the so-called Section 301. "We call on the relevant parties to ensure WTO compliance of their trade actions. We will analyze the measures being taken in terms of their WTO compatibility," Rosario told Xinhua. According to the spokesman, the EU has noticed the US action against China under Section 301 and has been closely following the investigations since they were launched in August 2017. Rosario also underlined the importance of the role of the WTO in dealing with trade differences.
0	A collection of Liu Yida's Beijing-style novels was promoted at a press conference held in Beijing's Ditan Park on Nov 10. "Beijing-style novels" refers to books written in Beijing dialect to describe people and stories in Beijing, reflecting the city's unique culture. According to Liu, Beijing culture mainly includes the culture of the royal family, the scholar-bureaucrats and the ordinary people who usually live in hutongs, Beijing's alleys. "Among the three kinds of culture, the third one best represents Beijing's characteristics," Liu said. Chinese writer Lao She, who wrote a lot about people's lives in four-section rectangular courtyard houses and hutongs, is regarded as a symbolic writer to create Beijing-style novels. Liu, who was born and grew up in Beijing's hutongs, also has enormous affection for Beijing's traditional culture. When he worked as a reporter for Beijing Evening News, he traveled through many hutongs and interviewed 10,000-plus people who lived there. The collection includes Liu's 12 novels which in the eyes of Wang Xunhai, general manager of Beijing Times Chinese Press, "shows the social changes in Beijing over the past 40 years with vivid characters and legendary stories." The creation of these books is also about cultural inheritance. "With Beijing's urban development, much of its original culture no longer exists. I have the sense of responsibility to record some of the past," Liu said.

After the performance on Sept 9, a special contribution award ceremony for China-US cultural exchange was held by the mayor of San Francisco, Edwin Lee, in Beijing.  At the ceremony, Lee recognized two significant contributors, Peter Liu, the founder and chairman of WI Harper Group, a cross-border venture capital firm, and He Chenguang, the vice-president of the China-Cuba Friendship Association, for bringing the opera  to China.  written by Cao Xueqin during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), is considered one of China's greatest classical novels, and its latest rendition is set to thrill opera lovers in the country. The San Francisco Opera held the world premiere of its operatic production based on the novel in September 2016.
0	BEIJING - China does not want to see World Trade Organization trade remedy measures abused or used for protectionism, the country's Ministry of Commerce said Thursday. The US commerce department Wednesday launched anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures against Chinese steel wheels and decided that general-purpose aluminum alloy plates from China received government subsidies. "Steel products have become a major target of US trade remedy measures, which account for over half the country's total trade remedy measures," ministry spokesperson Gao Feng said at a press conference. "Over-use of trade remedy measures in certain sectors will not sustain booming industrial growth, and China hopes the United States will return to the right track of win-win cooperation to help promote global trade and nurture domestic industries," Gao said.
0	BEIJING --Chinese President Xi Jinping met with Mauritanian President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz on Sunday ahead of the 2018 Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC). China-Mauritania relations are a fine example of China's relations with African and developing countries, Xi stressed. China regards Mauritania as a sincere and reliable friend and partner, and appreciates the firm support that Mauritania always gives on issues involving China's core interests and major concerns, Xi said, adding that China will continue to support Mauritania's efforts in safeguarding stability and seeking development. The two sides should regard the Belt and Road cooperation as a new starting point for innovating cooperation models, pushing collaboration in key areas including infrastructure, and strengthening the ability for Mauritania to achieve self-reliant development, Xi said.,China appreciates the active role that President Aziz plays in the regional efforts to fight terrorism and maintain stability, and is willing to cooperate with member countries of the G5 Sahel in peace and security via various ways. Aziz said Mauritania speaks highly of China's firm support for multilateralism and its contribution to world peace and security, and highly appreciates the proposal by President Xi of building a community with a shared future for humanity. Mauritania firmly upholds the one-China policy, Aziz said, adding that Mauritania believes that the Belt and Road Initiative will promote Africa-China joint development while the FOCAC Beijing Summit will promote Africa-China cooperation and the building of an even stronger China-Africa community with a shared future. After the meeting, the two leaders witnessed the signing of bilateral cooperation documents.
0	Businesses in Beijing achieved a total revenue of 3 billion yuan ($440 million) during the three-day New Year's holiday, up 6.3 percent year-on-year, according to data from the municipal commerce bureau on Tuesday. "Many outlets had promotions and major discounts during the holiday to attract customers, with sales growing more than 40 percent compared with the same period last year," said the bureau. Winter sports, culture and entertainment were particularly popular with customers, with many companies holding ice- and snow-related events, which is a new trend, the bureau said.
0	Beijing will start construction of its first special bicycle lane in September connecting a crowded residential area with a business center to ease traffic congestion, the municipal government announced. Unlike other bike lanes in Beijing, which are often crowded with cars, this one will be exclusively for cyclists. Yang Xiufeng, an official at the Beijing Commission of Transport who is in charge of road construction projects, said the bike lane is designed to be 6.5 kilometers long and 6 meters wide. The speed limit will be 20 kilometers per hour. "Construction of the lane will be completed by June next year," Yang said. "In addition to two regular lanes in each direction, the center lane will be reversible and serve as a passing lane. To make it more convenient for riders, the lane will have eight pairs of exits and entrances. There will be no traffic lights along the whole distance." The lane will connect the Huilongguan residential community in Changping district with the Shangdi area of Haidian district, where many companies are located. Yang said the authorities will continue to research bike lanes and might extend the lane to Zhongguancun Software Park, where many IT companies are located. The Beijing Municipal Institute of City Planning and Design proposed the bike lane in 2016. It takes just 20 to 30 minutes to commute by bicycle, while it can take more than an hour by car during rush hour. About 370,000 people live in Huilongguan, with up to 20 percent of them working in Zhongguancun. More than 16 percent work in Shangdi. Even if people don't drive and choose public transportation, they still have to leave home an hour in advance because of the large number of people using buses and subways during rush hour. Beijing has many designated lanes for bicycles. However, cars are increasingly encroaching, and they are often crowded with parked cars. Beijing has nearly 6 million cars, up from only 1.3 million in 1998. Zhang Lian, an IT engineer who lives in Huilongguan and commutes by subway, said she welcomes all methods that can ease congestion. "The new bike lane will definitely be convenient for us. Right now, there are always a bunch of cars parked near the subway stations during rush hour," she said. "When the bike lane is finished, I will ride to work." However, Yu Shenlan, a resident of Huilongguan in her 30s, said she doesn't think people will easily change their commuting habits. When it's too cold or too hot, many people still prefer to drive, she said.

The announcement came right before JD's first fresh food supermarket 7Fresh started its official operation on Thursday, an indication of the increasingly intense competition and rapid expansion of the two e-commerce giants. With Hema opening in major commercial districts across Beijing including Xizhimen, Guang'anmen and Shuangjing, consumers in major urban areas of Beijing can have their groceries delivered to a location within a radius of three kilometers from the store in 30 minutes. "We are proud to announce that Hema has discovered an exclusive means of 'new retail' at the beginning of the new year and is expanding quickly in China and outside the world," said Hou Yi, CEO of Hema. According to Hou, Hema stores are an example of Alibaba's new retail strategy, which aims to digitalize and transform the traditional grocery shopping experience and integrate online and offline shopping. The Hema stores, which feature a fresh seafood section including king crab and lobster, provide customers the option to either pop into the store and choose their goods, or order online through a proprietary app and have it delivered within half an hour. The new business model also allows customers to eat in-store through buying products in the supermarket and getting its restaurant staff to cook it. The online giant said last year that its first such store, which opened more than two years ago in Shanghai, has become profitable. Shoppers on average make 4.5 purchases per month and visit the supermarket 50 times a year, according to the company. The stores' sales per unit area is three-to-five times those of other supermarkets. While Hema has opened five stores in Beijing so far, Hou added that in 2018 the company will "concentrate more on the Beijing market in addition to expanding its business across China". Faced with increasingly fierce domestic competition, the company said that it will strive to improve retail efficiency using new technologies to develop new products and meet new demand.
0	SHIJIAZHUANG - The Taihang Mountain Highway linking northern China's Hebei province with Beijing starts operation Friday, according to Hebei provincial transport department. The highway, with a total length of 650 km, connects Hebei's mountainous region with the capital and its neighboring provinces including Shanxi and Henan, benefiting a total of 7.4 million people living in the mountainous areas. The highway will facilitate the poverty-stricken population in the Taihang mountain region as the local government is speeding up the development of red tourism, agricultural and sanatorium industries, said an official with Hebei's transport department. The Taihang Mountain Highway has been built to be an important part of the integration of the transport network in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region.

0	China considers it significant that the United States has recently indicated that trade friction should be dealt with through dialogue and communication, and will keep the door open for negotiation, Premier Li Keqiang said. Li made the remark when meeting with US Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao in the Zhongnanhai leadership compound in Beijing on Thursday afternoon. "China and the US are the world's largest developing country and the largest developed country. Maintaining stable and sound growth in relations between China and the US meets the expectations of both countries and people around the world," Li said. Mutual benefit and win-win results are the essence of trade and economic cooperation between China and the US, Li said. No winner would emerge from a trade conflict, and a trade conflict could also affect world economic recovery and hit the global industrial chain, Li told Chao. He said that sitting down for dialogue is the only way to successfully deal with trade frictions facing the two nations. Noting that President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump have had many conversations, both in person and over the phone, Li said the two countries should implement important consensuses reached by the two leaders and work together in the spirit of mutual trust, mutual respect and consultation on an equal footing to reduce differences. He added that China is willing to push forward pragmatic cooperation with the US regarding transportation, including autonomous vehicles. The premier also said that China, with huge market potential, will firmly further its opening-up and hopes all countries, including the US, will take advantage of opportunities created by China's opening-up efforts. Chao congratulated Li on China's economic performance in continuing to maintain a high growth rate. Relations between China and the US now stand at a critical stage of development, she said, and she added that she hopes both countries will reach a positive outcome from trade and economic dialogue and promote pragmatic cooperation. Chao is leading the US delegation participating in talks as part of the China-US Transportation Forum in Beijing. The forum, established in 2008, facilitates partnerships and bilateral dialogue in areas of mutual interest. The meetings have focused recently on automated vehicles and infrastructure development. At a meeting on Thursday, Chao said she hopes the forum will "strengthen the discussion between our two ministries and contribute to a long-term relationship that is constructive and results-oriented".
0	Wang Ning has worked in the Xiongan New Area, a new economic zone in North China, for nearly two years and expects to become a permanent Xiongan resident in the future. Wang, 35, considers herself a "Xiongpiao" - a term she created based on "Beipiao", a description of outsiders who live and work in Beijing but do not have permanent residency. The accountant at China Railway Xiongan Construction Co came to Xiongan in July 2017, three months after the new area was established in Hebei province. She left behind a new apartment and a stable life 1,300 kilometers away in Harbin, Heilongjiang province, in Northeast China. Wang is one of the company's 300 employees in Xiongan, 200 of whom are from outside the area. What has attracted them to the huge new economic zone is their belief in the rosy prospects for the Xiongan New Area. "I came with determination because Xiongan will be one of China's most developed cities in the future, with the best public services," said Wang, who lives with her family in a rented house in the area's Rongcheng county. By 2035, Xiongan will be built into a high-level modern city that will be green, livable, smart and innovation-driven, with convenient transportation, modern infrastructure and high-quality public services, according to an overall development plan cited by Xinhua News Agency. Located about 100 kilometers southwest of Beijing, Xiongan was set up in April 2017, covering three counties in Hebei. Its establishment was a key move in China's national strategy for the coordinated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. Its main task is to take on Beijing's noncapital functions, including universities, research institutes, medical institutions, corporate headquarters, and financial and public institutions. The new area can thereby help the capital to ease big city malaise issues such as swelling population and heavy traffic, while Beijing can strengthen its role as a political, cultural, international communication and innovation center. "The key for the coordinated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region is to relieve Beijing of noncapital functions and build the Xiongan New Area with a high standard," according to this year's Government Work Report, which was delivered by Premier Li Keqiang on March 5 to the annual plenary session of the National People's Congress, China's top legislature. The bright future of Xiongan has attracted numerous "Xiongpiao" like Wang Ning, as well as enterprises that are in line with the area's development direction. More than 230 corporations from Beijing have transferred to the new area during the past two years, according to Wang Dongfeng, secretary of the Communist Party of China Hebei Provincial Committee. Among them is Beijing Eyecool Technology Co, a biometric identification company that moved its headquarters from the Zhongguancun technology hub in Beijing to Xiongan in September. According to company General Manager Zhang Jin, it has started to provide biometric identification services, including facial-scanning access control systems and smart payment systems, in the Xiongan Citizen Service Center and Aowei Mansion, two major locations for local government and company offices. "We are fortunate to become one of the high-tech companies that have settled down in the new area," Zhang said. Plans for Xiongan envision it becoming a world-class, innovation-driven city with the layout of high-end and high-tech industries, such as the new generation of information technology, modern life science and biotechnology, new materials, high-end modern services and green ecological agriculture, People's Daily reported. "While keeping the acceptance of noncapital functions from Beijing as the top priority, Xiongan also eyes the world to absorb innovation resources, especially those Beijing doesn't have yet," Wang Dongfeng, the Hebei Party chief, said during the recent two sessions, the annual plenary meetings of the nation's top legislative and political advisory bodies. According to Chen Gang, Party chief of Xiongan, a total of 31 plans for the area have been finalized, including an overall plan, a plan for the protection of Baiyangdian - a wetland lake in the area - and 26 plans for various fields such as flood control, anti-seismic measures and comprehensive transportation. Two years after the zone's establishment, the new area has now shifted its focus from preliminary plans to construction. "Xiongan is about to reach the full-scale construction stage, and we need to implement the blueprint thoroughly," Chen said last month. China Xiongan Group, a State-owned company established in 2017 for Xiongan's development, has made about 30 announcements on its website since September for bids to carry out projects. The projects include the construction of green belts, waste treatment facilities, rail transit stations, urban roads, pipe network systems, offices and hotels. According to the overall plan, by 2022 the construction of infrastructure will be basically completed and the appearance of an urban area will be initially formed, Xinhua reported. President Xi Jinping emphasized "Xiongan quality" in February last year, saying the area must become a model of high-quality development for the country. Chen, the Xiongan Party chief, said, "In the full-scale construction stage, we must stick to scientific construction and strengthen whole-process supervision to ensure the quality of projects." Wu Hequan, deputy director of the Council of Experts for Coordinated Development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region, told Xinhua that transferring Beijing's noncapital functions is the key test of whether the coordinated development of the region is going smoothly. Chen said improving public services will be one of the first tasks undertaken to make sure that such functions develop well in Xiongan. Chen said several schools and medical institutions from Beijing and Tianjin have started to plan projects in the area. Wang Ning, the accountant, said she will stay in Xiongan because the education for her 10-year-old daughter is gradually improving, as are other public services.
0	The premarital checkup rate in China increased to nearly 60 percent of all new couples in 2016, after a series of measures taken in recent years to encourage the exams as a way to help reduce birth defects, China's top health authority said. In 2016, 59.7 percent of all couples who married in China had a premarital checkup, with diseases spotted in more than 930,000 people that could affect birth, the National Health and Family Planning Commission wrote in response to written questions from China Daily. Premarital checkups, which target diseases that could affect the health of couples or their offspring, can help with early diagnosis and treatment and to promote reproductive health, reduce birth defects and improve the population's overall health, the commission said. Premarital checkup rates declined sharply in China once the exams became voluntary with the adoption of a new regulation in 2003. The rate declined to 2.9 percent in 2005 and rebounded to 41 percent in 2011 and to 48.4 percent in 2012, figures previously released by the commission showed. Birth defects had increased amid a declining rate of premarital checkups, records show. The incidence of congenital heart diseases in China in 2011 was 3.56 times that in 2000, according to a report released by the commission in 2012. Qin Geng, chief of maternal and child health at the commission, said the number of babies born with defects every year in China was estimated at 900,000. With the adoption of the universal second-child policy since the start of 2016, a rising number of couples are trying to have a child, including groups considered to have higher risks such as women older than 35. Some medical experts have called for more ways to encourage checkups to reduce health risks for both women and children. Of the 90 million women eligible to have a second baby, 60 percent are 35 or older, according to the national commission. Liu Wenxian, a cardiologist at Anzhen Hospital in Beijing, said that with the policy an increasing number of women with risky conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, are giving birth at hospitals. "Some of them are in such serious condition that we advise them not to put their health at risk and have a baby likely to have birth defects," he said. "We recommend all couples have a checkup before marriage and pregnancy, although it is no longer mandatory." In recent years, the commission has increased investment in promoting premarital checkups. It launched a pilot project in 2012 that includes free premarital checkups that initially covered the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region and Hainan and Yunnan provinces, it said. The project, aimed at reducing the incidence of Mediterranean anemia, an inherited blood disease that can be fatal for children, had covered 10 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions in southern China that are more severely hit by the disease, the commission said. With financial support from local governments, residents in 18 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions, including Beijing, Shanghai, Anhui and Hunan, can now undergo free premarital checkups, it said. Through promotional efforts in other areas, such as the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region and Fujian province, the premarital exam rate has risen to more than 90 percent, the commission said. In Beijing, the rate declined from 100 percent in 2003 to as low as 5 percent in subsequent years, and rebounded to about 10 percent in 2016 after various promotional efforts, according to the Beijing Commission of Health and Family Planning. Nationwide, major conditions covered by premarital checkups include inherited diseases, certain infectious diseases and mental diseases such as schizophrenia, according to a regulation released by the commission. HIV tests are not mandatory, but local governments can decide whether to include them in their checkup programs, the regulation said.

In March, when the expo held its first show in Tianjin, the event launched a subsidy of up to 10,000 yuan ($1,584) for buyers at the show who become app-registered members. Members can get a subsidy of up to 3-10 percent off their entire bill if they can't come to the show and only appear on the app site. The online subsidy will soon be available at later sessions of the expo in Wuhan, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing and Hangzhou, beginning the third week in March, said Xiao Changhong, deputy secretary-general of the expo's organizing committee. The annual revenue of the overall expo - which has exhibitions in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Guangzhou and Wuhan - totals 10 billion yuan. The online service is expected to account for 5 percent of the expo's revenue this year and to double next year, Xiao said. In one way, this might seem like a bad time to get involved in the wedding business, as China is witnessing a downward trend in the number of marriages. Statistics from the Ministry of Civil Affairs indicated that 10.59 million couples were married in 2017, down 9.44 percent year-on-year. Of those who do seek marriage, however, the pursuit of a high-quality wedding is on an upward trajectory. Chinese spending on weddings differs from region to region, but overall, spending on weddings and associated travel is seeing sustained growth. In Beijing, for example, a new couple's spending, excluding apartment and car, averages from 230,000 yuan to 250,000 yuan, according to data from the expo. In Tianjin, the price drops to 155,000 yuan to 170,000 yuan, but in Shanghai, the figure rises to 270,000-280,000 yuan, research indicates. At wedding expos in Paris and Toronto, Xiao said, much of the promotional activity centers around travel, but in China, the wedding dress, banquet and other products - including cars - has traditionally accounted for the bulk of spending. The expo now looks to make a foray into the overseas travel wedding sector as demand for wedding-related tourism is rising fast in cities including Beijing and Shanghai.

In the future, there will be four north-south and two east-west high-speed rail routes, as well as four north-south and three east-west expressways across the area. By train, it will take only 20 minutes from Xiongan to Beijing's new airport in southern Daxing district, 30 minutes to Beijing or Tianjin, 60 minutes to Hebei's provincial capital Shijiazhuang. By car, it will need just 60 minutes to drive from Xiongan to Beijing or Tianjin, and 90 minutes to Shijiazhuang. Launched in April last year, Xiongan New Area sits at the center of the triangular area formed by Beijing, Tianjin and Shijiazhuang. It is about 100 kilometers southwest of Beijing, 100 km west of Tianjin and 160 km northeast of Shijiazhuang.
1	Academic achievements, companions and recognition from others are the main sources of happiness for Chinese primary and secondary school students, according to the first "Chinese Children's Happy Growth Index", jointly released by four institutions on Sept 20 in Beijing. This index analyzed the key elements of a growth in happiness ¡ª drawing on advanced theories from both home and abroad ¡ª by conducting a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the influencing factors of children's happiness. According to the research, the average score of Chinese children's happiness growth is currently 82.22, which indicates most Chinese children are "Quite Happy". 70.1 percent of the Chinese children regard high grades in school as the greatest happiness, exceeding other factors by more than 20 percentage points. Hanging out with friends provides enjoyment for 49.3 percent of children, ranking second. In general, junior-grade students and children with better physical and academic records find it easier to be happy, according to the survey. However, the results also show that 46.9 percent of the students are suffering from sleep deprivation caused by school assignments. During the survey, 97 percent of mothers label their children as "happy", while only 92.5 percent of the children hold the same opinion. Over 30 percent of the children say their parents play on their cellphones during parent-child conversation. This index system was built through the analytic hierarchy process from the Internet Development Research Institution of Peking University, combining the specific national conditions and environmental features of children's learning, living and developing processes in China.  After the system construction was completed, 3,475 valid samples were collected by China Youth and Children Research Center through questionnaires from 28 primary and secondary schools in seven cities, including Beijing, Guangzhou, Nanjing, Chengdu, Liaoyang, Fuyang and Changsha.  Among the seven cities surveyed, children in Beijing ¡ª with an average happiness score of 86.10 ¡ª enjoy the highest degree of happiness, followed by Nanjing (84.66) and Guangzhou (83.15).  A gap of almost 10 points separates Fuyang ¡ª the city with the lowest score of 76.64 ¡ªand Beijing, showing that children in first-tier cities have the highest level of happiness, while third-tier cities' children enjoy the lowest. "This study opens a window for the whole society to understand children and provides a possible approach to better foster children's happiness and well-being," said Sun Hongyan, children's department director of the China Youth and Children Research Center.  This newly-published index also provides a solid theoretical basis for scientifically promoting the healthy development of children in China, Sun added.
0	BEIJING - China hopes for positive and constructive outcomes from the ongoing Sino-US economic and trade consultations, the Ministry of Commerce (MOC) said Thursday. "We hope that the two sides can meet each other halfway, and properly resolve disputes and manage differences through consultations, based on the principle of mutual respect and equal consultation," MOC spokesperson Gao Feng said at a press conference. Gao also expressed hope that the two sides would make joint efforts to advance bilateral economic and trade cooperation. "China does not want to see escalating Sino-US economic and trade friction, but is prepared for all possible scenarios," Gao said. Chinese Vice-Premier Liu He arrived in Washington Tuesday afternoon for economic and trade consultations with the US side at the invitation of the US government. Gao reiterated China's opposition to the US Section 301 investigation and urged the United States to cease investigation procedures. The Section 301 investigation is "an act of unilateralism" and "unpopular with the public," he said, citing that more than 90 percent of the 2,000-plus published comments during the hearings opposed the tariff proposal. "China expects the United States to take concrete action as soon as possible on a case involving Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE, and to resolve it in a fair and reasonable manner," he said. The comment came after US President Donald Trump said in a tweet Sunday that the two sides are working together to give ZTE "a way to get back into business, fast," and the US Commerce Department has been instructed to work on the issue. Gao pointed out that market forces were behind China-US economic and trade cooperation. "We will resolutely defend our own interests and will not make any deal at the cost of China's core interests," Gao said. Gao said China would expand the opening of its market in a proactive, steady and orderly manner, in accordance with its own development need, its own pace and timetable, to benefit both the Chinese people and people across the world.
1	Xu Jinghong, co-chair of Summer Davos in Dalian, insists robots taking over manufacturing jobs could lead to more enriched lives for people. The chairman of Tsinghua Holdings, the technology investment arm of China's elite Beijing university, said it was important to combat fears that the so-called Fourth Industrial Revolution could lead to mass unemployment within a decade or more. "The Fourth Industrial Revolution will eventually make people richer and when people become more affluent they have a greater need for culture and the arts," he said.   "In a traditional society, you may think you have to go and work in a factory or a company. With robots, manufacturing will take care of itself," he added. The 54-year-old was instrumental in setting up the Tsinghua Science Park in 1994, which is now one of the largest of its kind in the world, and stressed that it was important to educate the workforce so they were prepared for new opportunities. "Education needs to give people the skills to work in the new culture and service industries," Xu said. He pointed out that the aim of the forum was to send out the message that the Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is the theme of this year's event, must be inclusive and not leave people behind. "I hope the participants exchanging ideas here can come up with suggestions as to how we can achieve inclusive growth," he said. Xu, who is also deputy director of the advisory board of Zhongguancun National Demonstration Zone, or China's Silicon Valley, insisted that the country's aim was not to beat other nations in a so-called technology race. Known as the Fourth Industrial Revolution, this covers the advent of artificial intelligence, the internet of things and autonomous vehicles as well as robotics. "The question is not whether a country wants to knock anyone out of the race, but to achieve a solution for the whole of mankind to benefit," he said. "As far as I know, Chinese entrepreneurs want to contribute to the development of the whole world, not to be against anyone else." Xu has spent his adult life at Tsinghua, starting as an undergraduate mechanical engineering student at 17 before holding a number of academic positions. He became chairman of Tsinghua Holdings, one of the biggest investors in technology companies in the country, in 2012. Under his leadership, its assets have grown more than sixfold from 58 billion yuan ($8.49 billion) to 350 billion yuan. "The success of the investments is something I am most pleased about," he said. One of the criticisms of Chinese universities is that they have been able to churn out engineers but not enough people who can drive innovation.
0	State-owned auto groups in China used to sit back and collect the easy money from joint-venture brands, but as domestic demand for auto products diversified and their ambitions grew, international markets, internet-connected and new energy vehicles have become greener pastures. Among them, Beijing Automotive Industry Corp, one of China's five major automakers by sales revenue, plans to deploy more resources into the research and development of electrification, artificial intelligence, the internet of things and the sharing economy to further compete with other established rivals both at home and abroad. Many opportunities have been generated by China's reform and opening-up policy, industrial and consumption upgrading, favorable policies to improve environment via new energy vehicles, as well as the tangible development of the Belt and Road Initiative and the comprehensive trade platform of the China International Import Expo, said Xu Heyi, chairman of BAIC. With this year marking the 40th anniversary of reform and opening-up, Xu said the auto manufacturing business in the nation has already become an industry that needs cross-sector collaboration to integrate technologies and expertise from various segments such as energy, electronics, software, internet, new materials, finance, customer and legal services to remain competitive. "We will add investment to further digitalize our entire value chain from product design to research and development, logistics, production, quality and financial services in both our domestic and overseas manufacturing facilities. All the steps have to be digitally synchronized to ensure efficient execution and complete alignment with the customers' needs," he said. As China's commitments to the World Trade Organization have further opened the country's automotive sector including cutting tariffs, liberalizing joint-venture stocks and gradually removing subsidies from certain types of vehicles, Xu stressed, manufacturers in China must face this reality and take effective measures to seek new growth points through innovation and new business models. Even though China manufactured and sold some 29 million vehicles in 2017, its auto plants had a combined annual capacity of about 64 million units, data from Beijing-based China Association of Automobile Manufacturers show. Xu said most of this redundant capacity comes from Chinese brands and is partly the result of certain carmakers taking advantage of local governments' interest in the industry following China becoming the world's largest vehicle market in 2009. He urged Chinese automotive brands to solve their problems quickly as they would face greater pressure when the sector opens up more to the global players. China has already slashed tariffs on imported vehicles from 25 percent to 15 percent and Xu expects the government to further cut this figure in the coming years. The country is also phasing out limits on foreign ownership in automotive joint ventures by 2022. "Apparently, time is running out, and everybody is aware what a challenging position domestic automakers will be in, in terms of quality, branding, technology accumulation and other factors," Xu said. Despite significant progress in recent years, Chinese brands are still considered underdogs in the domestic market. Their sales of passenger vehicle totaled 7.24 million in the first three quarters of this year, accounting for 42.3 percent of the country's total amount in this kind, dropping 0.9 percent year-on-year, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. To meet the increasingly personalized needs of customers, BAIC will continue to add a flexible production model that combines people, machines and production processes in its business scale, allowing the automaker to produce sedans and sports utility vehicles on the same production line, even in both pure electric and traditional combustion engine configuration in the future. BAIC has been investing handsomely in new energy vehicles to offset rising competition from companies in Germany, the United States and Japan. It will collaborate with new partners in vehicle and component manufacturing, as well as in various parts of the new energy vehicle industry. The company's own brand sales of such vehicles doubled to 103,000 in 2017. Deliveries of its new energy models also soared by 78.5 percent to 54,000 vehicles between January and June of this year. The Beijing-based CAAM predicted that the number of new energy vehicles will reach 5 million in the country by 2020. Eager to enhance its earning ability, the group will provide more pure battery-powered cars under its new premium brand - Arcfox, in late 2019 or early 2020. The first model will feature a steel and aluminum body to reduce the weight while also strengthening driving safety. BAIC has also partnered with Canadian automotive supplier Magna International Inc to jointly develop a high-end smart electric vehicle, and Arcfox-branded vehicles in Zhenjiang, East China's Jiangsu province. Magna is one of the world's largest automotive suppliers, having 340 manufacturing operations and 93 product development, engineering and sales centers in 28 countries and regions. In addition to manufacturing new energy vehicles, BAIC is also focusing on improving off-road vehicle offerings because customers today have higher demands for their SUVs' functionality. The company found many consumers in China love road travel and believe "bigger is better" while choosing family vehicles. Therefore SUVs have become a hot option in meeting their demand. Statistics from the China Tourism Academy showed that the Chinese people made 223 million self-driving trips in the first half of 2017, with the average distance of 142.8 kilometers. Of the drivers, more than 80 percent were aged between 31 and 35. The academy said these people are mainly middle and high-income earners and they are more interested in vehicle functions and travel experiences, rather than destinations. After 60 years of development, BAIC currently employs over 130,000 staff worldwide and has built more than 20 plants, and research and development centers in South Africa, Mexico, India, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, Germany, Italy and the US. It sold 2.51 million vehicles globally in 2017, netting 470.3 billion yuan ($68.9 billion) in revenue. The group has subsidiary joint-venture companies including BAIC Hyundai Motor Co and Beijing Benz Automotive Co. "The auto market is usually seen as a barometer of the macroeconomy, as it reflects the scale of GDP, consumption power, regional trade and the development of industrialization, as well as infrastructure development," said Li Guanghui, vice-president of the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation in Beijing.
0	More than one-third of major Chinese cities saw reduced traffic congestion in the third quarter of this year, compared with the same period last year, according to a report published on Monday. The report, based on traffic data from 100 cities, found that 37 of them had become less congested. Traffic in 42 cities was the same, while conditions were worse in the remainder. The report was released by AMAP, a major online map provider in China, and several other companies and institutes, including bike-sharing company Mobike. It measured congestion by comparing actual time spent commuting with that required over the same distance when roads are not crowded. In general, bigger cities tended to have more serious traffic congestion. Jinan, Shandong province, was ranked as the most-congested city, with an index of 2.065 during peak hours£­meaning drivers spent more than twice as long on the road on average between 7 and 9 am, and 5 and 7 pm, compared with free flowing traffic. Harbin and Beijing ranked second and third, with indexes of 2.049 and 2.046. July proved to be the least-crowded month in 63 of the 100 cities. On the other hand, September, when schools opened, was the most crowded month for 84 cities. Shijiazhuang, Hebei province, saw the biggest improvement in traffic congestion between July and September, with the index decreasing by 9.9 percent. The major cause was the opening of a subway line in June, which helped reduce automobile use. Eight other cities such as Guiyang, Guizhou province, and Xiamen, Fujian province, also saw their indexes decline by more than 5 percent. In addition to more public transport, the adoption of internet technologies to improve traffic management also helped ease traffic congestion in cities such as Shenzhen, Guangdong province. In Beijing, widespread use of shared bikes contributed to easing traffic around many residential areas, with the index decreasing by more than 40 percent for some roads where there was a surge in the number of shared bikes, the report said. Chen Yanyan, a professor of transport studies at Beijing University of Technology, said that as cities become bigger, a combination of transportation modes, such as subways, buses and bikes, can better meet people's demand for swifter traffic. "Intensive study of supply and demand for various means of transportation can help establish an effective urban transport network," she said. With the adoption of new technologies such as big data, use of road resources can be optimized to improve traffic efficiency and ease congestion, she said.

The report cited data from the China Institute for Income Distribution of Beijing Normal University, showing that the middle-income class is expected to scale up to 43 percent in 2020 if there are no policy changes, while the figure could reach up to 50 percent with preferential policies. To let more money go into the pockets of the low-income class is one means to strengthen the middle-class pool, exports told the newspaper. As of July, at least 12 provinces or regions have raised minimum wages, and six regions -- including Shanghai, Guangdong, Beijing and Tianjin -- have had their minimum wages exceed 2,000 yuan ($296.8) each month. "The group with payment below the minimum level benefits most from the minimum wage adjustment scheme, but the policy also does good to higher-wage earners in some degree," Wan Haiyuan, deputy dean with CIID, told Economic Information Daily. He added that though it is reasonable to gradually increase the minimum income, blind augmentation will cause pressure on employment. Li Shi, executive dean of CIID, said in an interview with the newspaper that farmers, migrant workers, self-employed entrepreneurs, small and micro business owners and startup pioneers all possess the potential to access to the middle-income level and should be the target of policy support. At the same time, to break institutional barriers in the way to stretch up to middle income is also important. Li said that improving social security system and boosting human resources could help to promote low-income flow into the middle-income class, while government should create room for the existing middle-income group to move up by focusing on issues like occupational mobility and the steady rise of salaries. "The individual income taxation structure still needs to be optimized to relieve burdens for the middle-income group," Guan Bo, assistant researcher with the social development research institution of the National Development and Reform Commission, said to Economic Information Daily. Guan noted that better quality in public services ranging from elder care, healthcare and education and lowered expenses are needed to stabilize the group. The crucial cause of income disparity is education, according to Sun Jingfang, assistant researcher with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, as Economic Information Daily reported. Sun said that government should advance education equalization, and improve education quality in rural areas in particular, so as to lay a foundation of human resources for expanding the middle-income group and economic development.
0	The book Peasant Life in China, written by prestigious anthropologist and sociologist Fei Xiaotong in the 1930s, lifted the veil on the nation's rural areas to the outside world by documenting traditional life in a small village in Suzhou, Jiangsu province. Fei was a pioneering researcher and professor noted for his studies of China's ethnic groups. He was born in Wujiang, Jiangsu, in 1910 and died in Beijing in 2005. British social anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski (1884-1942) wrote in the preface to Fei's book: "Our attention here is directed not to a small, insignificant tribe, but to the greatest nation in the world." The book was published in 1939 in the United Kingdom by Routledge. The far-reaching changes that have taken place in Suzhou since the book was published have transformed it into one of China's wealthiest areas in the four decades since the reform and opening-up policy was launched. Fei coined the term "the Sunan pattern" - literally the development path in southern Jiangsu - in 1983 at the age of 73 when he saw family-run village and township enterprises booming along the south bank of the Yangtze River, mainly in Suzhou, Wuxi and Changzhou. He had concluded decades earlier that this vast rural area could develop industry to adapt to changing times. Gradually introduced urbanization led by industry helped to lift the people out of poverty in the early 1980s. Cheng Changchun, a government counselor in Jiangsu and dean of the Jiangsu Yangtze River Delta Economic Research Institute, said, "The success and the transformative ability of the Sunan pattern is testimony to the effectiveness of the reform and opening-up policy." Cheng said that as the Chinese economy finds itself on the "cusp of yet another quantum leap", continued prosperity under the Sunan pattern underscores the need for the national reform and opening-up policy to be deepened and widened. Today, not many college graduates can resist decent pay and bright career prospects in a big city, but a few do. He Luwei, 37, who has a master's in economics, graduated from Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, the provincial capital, with a Certified Public Accountant qualification, but chose a career path different from that pursued by his peers in cities. Ten years ago, he went to Huaxi village in Jiangyin city, Wuxi, Jiangsu, and to his surprise found an ideal job and a dream place for a long-term stay. Now a senior accountant at a chemical fiber plant in Huaxi, where his wife was born, He said, "I've never regretted my decision to stay for the past 10 years." His wife graduated from Suzhou University. The couple's annual income is about 400,000 yuan ($57,720), equivalent to that of a middle-class family in Beijing. Dubbed the wealthiest village in the country for decades since the reform and opening-up policy was launched, the average annual personal income in Huaxi last year was 90,500 yuan. It was just 220 yuan in 1978. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the country's annual per capita disposable income was 25,974 yuan last year - 36,396 yuan for urban residents and 13,432 yuan for the rural population. Huaxi, or "the village", as people still refer to it, is now a commercial giant with diversified business and investment in manufacturing, mining, finance, metallurgy, textiles, tourism, marine industry, new energy, high-technology and modern agriculture. The village has a Shenzhen-listed company, Jiangsu Huaxicun Co, which saw revenue of just over 2 billion yuan last year, according to its annual report. The company was listed in 1999, making Huaxi the first village in the country with such an enterprise. The same year, the village's sales revenue reached 3.5 billion yuan. Jiangsu Huaxi Group Co, which is overseen by the village and is collectively owned by the residents, saw revenue of 50 billion yuan last year, driven by its transformation from low-efficiency steel and textile businesses to high-end manufacturing, modern agriculture and high-technology. Wu Xie'en, the village Party chief, said, "Our debt ratio is around 67 percent - completely reasonable and under control." Villagers who were born and grew up in Huaxi, who number about 2,800, receive dividends each year as well as monthly pay. "We are getting bigger and stronger by eating the 'reform meal'," Wu said. "Huaxi has caught the rhythm and each opportunity provided by reform and opening-up in the past 40 years." Wu, the son of the former Huaxi Party chief Wu Renbao, who died in March 2013 aged 85, took over from his father in 2003 as village Party chief and chairman of Jiangsu Huaxi Group, which owns and invests in more than 80 enterprises at home and abroad.,Most of the older generation in the village have Wu Renbao to thank for leading them out of poverty and into better homes with the wages to afford cars in the 1980s and '90s, when most of them took jobs at steel factories, thermal power plants and fiber businesses. In 1988, Huaxi became the first village in Jiangsu to be named a "100 million yuan village". Just three years later, it had more than 20 enterprises with business worth 500 million yuan. Such progress was partly due to neighboring Shanghai. Wu Xie'en said, "From 1978, we invited groups of engineers and technicians from Shanghai to train us at weekends with industrial development and technical skills. "The weekend engineers' training course was a turning point, helping us to build up Huaxi's industrial base and broaden our horizons." Led by Wu Xie'en, Jiangsu Huaxi Group's financial unit, V-capital, was launched in Shanghai in August 2015. With registered capital of 2 billion yuan, V-capital was managing 10 billion yuan in assets last year. V-capital has invested in CATL and Hero Entertainment, both unicorn enterprises (startups whose valuation has exceeded $1 billion). Ten heavily polluting and inefficient steel plants have been closed in Huaxi since 2004, reducing 1.5 million metric tons of steel and iron capacity, or one-third of output. "Dismantling 'blocks and walls' is crucial in our thinking to make further progress," Wu Xie'en said. "We have changed our methods and ways, but the path and beliefs remain the same." Huaxi spread its wings to Africa in 2015 by investing in mining in Mozambique, and also the semiconductor sector in the United States. By investing in a research team at Stanford University and in Gyrfalcon Technology in Silicon Valley in the US, V-capital has enabled Huaxi to hit the fast track to industrial upgrading and transformation. A laser chips project based at the Wujin high-tech park in Changzhou, Jiangsu, is expected to start mass production next year, entering a market estimated to be worth 500 billion yuan. Zhang Jianping, director of the Center for Regional Economic Cooperation affiliated to the Ministry of Commerce, said, "The Sunan pattern needs to progress and transform in the new era, and locals know they can't rest on past achievements. "It's good to see the Sunan pattern seeking new growth points and an innovative development model and path." With talent being the most important resource for future development, some professionals were sent to the US for short-term training, while others experienced weeklong "life experience" visits to the most underdeveloped areas in Qinghai and Guizhou provinces and the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. He Luwei, the senior accountant, was among the first batch of 26 sent to Chuandong village, Kaiyang county, Guizhou, in October 2013. "The trip allowed me to embrace disruptive thinking. Some of the pains and suffering I had complained about in the past were just imaginary illnesses," he said. Chen Feng, 38, who graduated from Xi'an Jiaotong University in Shaanxi province, is now deputy head of the rice business in Huaxi's modern agriculture sector, and married to a local. Huaxi invested in the Asahi Noyu Farm in Japan to learn the techniques to grow high-quality rice and to learn about advanced farming. The price of Nanjing 46, a type of Huaxi rice dubbed the tastiest in Jiangsu, doubled to more than 20 yuan per kilogram after it was grown using the techniques and experience used in Japan. Chen was among the first group to be sent to the West Point Military Academy in the US for a nine-day training course in December 2014. "I now have a deeper understanding of what duty, honor and country means. Most of all, I came to realize humanity is the most important element. It helped to shape and consolidate my leadership style - that is to cherish talent," she said. At Jiangsu Huaxi Group, 39 percent of the top executives are nonlocals, 60 percent of the middle management come from many different areas of the country, and 92 percent of the grassroots employees are from outside the village. While sending its talent on people-to-people exchanges, Huaxi receives 2 million visitors annually from home and abroad, including 400,000 who arrive in groups to learn from its experience, said Ge Xiaoyan, who works in the village's reception office. Yonglian village in Zhangjiagang, Suzhou, offers a similar story to that of Huaxi, but with variations. Zhang, the Regional Economic Research Center director, said, "Huaxi and Yonglian have grown simultaneously, both in similar and different ways. Both have made great efforts in upgrading and investing more on research and development to enhance their competitive edge." A giant golden sculpture featuring four fingers and a thumb stands at the entrance to Yonglian, which lies on a tributary of the Yangtze River with residential buildings on one bank and a village hall and museum on the other. The magic touch of Wu Dongcai, 83, the village's former Party chief, transformed Yonglian from poverty to one of the country's richest model villages over the past 40 years. The golden fingers sculpture is a symbol of Yonglian's unity and a mark of respect for Wu, who lost the little finger of his right hand during the Korean War (1950-53).,It is hard to believe that this modern and beautiful community is still called a village. But it is not difficult to understand why Yonglian was chosen as the only Chinese village to feature at the Milan World Expo in 2015, and one of only two from the country to be included in the Shanghai World Expo in 2010. However, 40 years ago, Yonglian was the poorest, smallest and most isolated river town in Suzhou. Founded in 1970, and built on 46.6 hectares of reed swamp along the Yangtze, it had just 254 households, or 700 villagers whose average annual income was 68 yuan in 1978. However, in the same year, Huaxi residents had flush toilets, and the village's development story had been heralded as a success in a lead story on the front page of People's Daily. Yonglian now covers 12 sq km and is home to 19,000 people, whose average annual income last year was 43,688 yuan, higher than China's urban residents' per capita income of 36,396 yuan and 2.5 times the average rural income in Jiangsu. Yonglian has become one of the richest villages in Suzhou, ranking top among the 640,000 counties in China in terms of economic achievement, tax payments, ecological environment, legal progress and cultural advancement. "We were a small, poor village with limited arable land that was flooded every year. So why not try to grow the fishing industry instead of farming?" said Wu Dongcai, who faced opposition when he first raised the idea. "I took the lead in digging a pond. We worked day and night for months before a meter-deep pond was completed," Wu said. Fish were raised in the pond and then sold. By the end of 1978, each family had plenty of food, including fish, and in 1979 each villager received a year-end allocation of extra food and necessities. That year, the term xiaokang (moderately prosperous society), was used by late leader Deng Xiaoping when he met with visiting Japanese prime minister Masayoshi Ohira and detailed the Four Modernizations, part of China's development roadmap and blueprint. The Four Modernizations were goals set by Deng to strengthen the fields of agriculture, industry, national defense, and science and technology. On Feb 5, 1983, Deng began an inspection tour of Suzhou, Hangzhou and Shanghai to study the feasibility of xiaokang. Yonglian was one of the three villages cited in a report to Deng for their advanced rural enterprises. Twenty years later, Yonglian was among the first villages in the country to embrace the xiaokang standard of living. By the end of 1983, it was home to eight plants producing iron and steel, furniture, cement and pillow covers, with combined assets of 200,000 yuan. Yonglian's industrial rise emerged from an opportunity to run a steel mill after an outsider arrived in the village to sell a steel rolling machine. "He was on the point of leaving before I stopped him, because I realized the business opportunity presented by the metal, driven by villagers' demand to build bigger and better houses after they became better off," Wu Dongcai said. On April 1, 1999, when Fei Xiaotong, the anthropologist, made a field study tour of Yonglian, he left with a calligraphy work titled Huaxia Diyi Gangcun (China's No 1 steel-making village). Last year, sales revenue in Yonglian reached 40.3 billion yuan, generated mainly by its steel business the Yonggang Group, with a 75 percent stake held by the company and the remaining 25 percent owned by all the villagers. Last year, Yonggang Group ranked 121st on a list of the country's top 500 private businesses by the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. Wu Huifang was a colonel before he left the People's Liberation Army and returned to Yonglian to serve as its Party chief and to help improve living conditions. "Our villagers have become citizens who need education and deserve more civil rights," he said. He was also behind the idea of building a village hall, which features Western-style architecture with state-of-the-art technology. The idea of designing the hall came in 2011 when he was sent to California for a training course. Visits to council venues in Carson, a city in Los Angeles County, impressed him. "Civilization can be learned and exchanged with others," Wu told online outlet The Paper. He received inspiration from his US visit to build the 5,000-sq-m hall in Yonglian, describing it as "a place that enables grassroots democracy to be more visible and approachable among villagers".
0	Both China and the United States saw positive signs before the third round of trade talks to negotiate disputes between the two largest economies in the world. A delegation headed by President Xi Jinping's special envoy and Vice-Premier Liu He arrived in Washington on Tuesday afternoon for economic and trade consultations with the US side at the invitation of the US government. The delegation members, coming from major economic sectors of the Chinese government, include Governor of the People's Bank of China Yi Gang, Vice-Chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission Ning Jizhe, Deputy Director of the Office of the Central Commission for Financial and Economic Affairs Liao Min, Vice-Foreign Minister Zheng Zeguang, Vice-Minister of Industry and Information Technology Luo Wen, Vice-Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao, Vice-Minister of Agriculture and Rural Affairs Han Jun, as well as Vice-Minister of Commerce and Deputy International Trade Representative Wang Shouwen. The two new members of the delegation are Vice-Minister of Agriculture and Rural Affairs Han Jun and Vice-Minister of Industry and Information Technology Luo Wen, neither of whom attended the China-US talks on trade and economic issues in Beijing earlier this May, when a senior US economic delegation led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin visited China. On Sunday, US President Donald Trump said in a tweet he and President Xi Jinping are working together to give Chinese telecom company ZTE Corp "a way to get back into business, fast." ¡°Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done!" Trump wrote. Several days ago, more than 1,100 economists sent a letter to United States President Donald Trump and the US Congress warning against the growing protectionism of the country's trade policies. The letter says tariff moves would restrict the flow of goods and capital and increased protective duties would be a mistake. 500 CFOs from around the world also expressed deep concerns about US policies that would restrict the flow of goods, capital and people. As such, this consultation is thought to be a crucial one; the Chinese delegation is under pressure to defend the core interests of the country, as well as the multilateral free trade system and global free trade. Meanwhile, the US side faces serious risk of pricing itself out of the market, or causing the talks to fall apart. Were either to happen, it would lead to enormous economic loss.
0	Companies from China and the United States will discuss details to jointly develop the Belt and Road Initiative and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank in November in Washington as the two governments re-engage in dialogue to resolve trade disputes, business leaders said on Wednesday. Jeremie Waterman, president of the China Center of the US Chamber of Commerce, said the chamber will engage with the AIIB as it already has many members from different continents and is supportive of the Belt and Road Initiative. "There is no doubt that infrastructure construction is critical to the development of the Belt and Road Initiative," he said. "We really want to know where the opportunities are." Waterman confirmed that a number of Chinese companies will visit the US to discuss details of cooperation and discover new growth points from both the Belt and Road Initiative and financial sector with US businesses in November. He said this at a news conference after the 10th round of dialogue between Chinese and US business leaders and former officials held from Tuesday to Wednesday in Beijing. In the meantime, Chinese President Xi Jinping's special envoy and Vice-Premier Liu He arrived in Washington on Tuesday afternoon for economic and trade consultations with the US side at the invitation of the US government. The Washington-headquartered US Chamber of Commerce is one of the world's largest business organizations representing the interests of more than 3 million businesses of all sizes, sectors and regions. Wei Jianguo, former vice-minister of commerce, said as the world's two biggest economies, the US and China are intensely interdependent and intertwined, and it is inevitable that any protective trade measures that are put in place will hurt the global value chain. "Supported by each other's technologies and huge consumption power, both sides have big potential to jointly develop fast-growing industries such as intelligent manufacturing, 5G, big data and cloud technologies, virtual reality and 3D printing," he added. "Many people in the US thought they had been helping China all the time, but actually we also did a lot," Yuan Yafei, chairman of private conglomerate Sanpower Group, said. Yuan's company employs more than 5,500 US citizens and has created more than 30,000 indirect jobs for the country. Yuan said his businesses in the US currently are not being heavily influenced by the ongoing trade disputes between the two sides. "However, some components shipped from China were delayed. The US customs began to check these products for some reasons, so the process was not as smooth as it was in the past. But I think this should be temporary," he said.
0	China announced on the beginning of this month that it will establish the Xiongan New Area in Hebei province, a strategy crucial for a millennium to come. Let's take a look at some officials and experts who have shared their insights on the Xiongan New Area. He urged strict control on massive property development in the Xiongan New Area and stressed that the pace of development should be reasonable.,  He said Beijing will take actions to support Xiongan New Area to fulfill its own "duty".  He said the main tasks are to share resources on infrastructure, transportation and public services between Beijing and Xiongan New Area and to keep increasing Xiongan's attractiveness for facilities with non-capital functions and talents. He said financial support will be provided in areas such as traffic management, ecology, water conservation, energy, and public services projects. Yan added that basic public facilities need to be excellent to attract good talent.,He said that China will explore a new path to reform the property market in the newly established Xiongan New Area in Hebei province.  The reform process will include managing property prices without hurting the real estate industry, making sure those in need of housing could afford one and making the new area attractive for startup founders.  Xiongan will help build a world-class city cluster. Currently, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei city cluster does not have a large enough economic scale and disparities between the cities are big.  At central and southern Hebei province, there isn't a "strong" city and quality of urbanization across Hebei needs improvement. Whether Xiongan can attract talent depends on convenient transportation system and whether the new area can do justice to the high-end talented people.  To develop a green, advanced and highly smart world-class transportation system, the new area should rely on buses to provide high accessibility and supplement the public transport system with bike sharing.
0	BEIJING - Beijing invested 492.2 billion yuan ($77.9 billion) in transport over the past five years, local authorities said Sunday. The investment represented a 44-percent increase from the 340 billion yuan in the five-year period to 2016 as the city sought to ease traffic jams and improve transport networks connecting neighboring regions, said the Beijing Municipal Commission of Transport. Seventy-five percent of the money was spent on public transport, and authorities attracted 57.8 billion yuan of investment through public-private partnership and build-operate-transfer modes, it said. With 22 subway lines in operation, the total length of rail transit in the Chinese capital had increased to 608 km by the end of 2017 from 442 km five years ago. Meanwhile, the total length of expressways had increased to 1,017 km from 922 km while that of arterial roads had increased to 1,365 km from 1,226 km. As the authorities seek to integrate Beijing with its neighbors Tianjin and Hebei, they have been building more high-speed railways and highways in the region.
0	An ongoing exhibition at Beijing's Prince Gong's Mansion celebrates the age-old art of carving on fruit pits, which has evolved into different styles in northern and southern China. It now shows through Sept 18 some 72 works created by artisans in Suzhou, Jiangsu province on olive stones. The earliest pieces date to the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).  From Sept 23 to Oct 23, they will be replaced by dozens of works showing the techniques of artisans from Weifang, Shandong province, who're sculpting mainly on peach pits and sometimes on apricot pits. Shown objects feature popular themes including figures, animals of Chinese zodiacs, flowers and landscapes.
0	The main structure of the high-speed expressway connecting the Beijing Daxing International Airport to the capital completed construction on Sunday. That means the ground transport lines connecting to the new airport have been completed, overcoming many construction challenges, according to CCTV reports on Sunday. Four bridges on three major transport lines connecting the new airport had completed swivel construction at 2 am on Sunday after 90-minutes of night work, CCTV reported. The total weight of the four bridges is about 10,000 tons, with 70 degrees of maximum rotation, local authorities said. Zhang Yanduo, expressway project manager of the new airport from the Beijing Infrastructure Investment Co., said the implementation of the rotation plan for four bridges in synchronization on the expressway is the first of its kind at home and abroad. Major challenges include that the window for rotation is only 90 minutes due to the busy transportation activity on the Beijing-Shanghai railway, which passes through the project construction areas. The time for construction has to be accurate to even single seconds. Located on the border of Beijing and Langfang, North China's Hebei province, the new airport, which will be the capital's second international airport, aims to be a transportation hub amid the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region when construction is completed.
0	BEIJING - Beijing's spring season comes again with unruly companions of airborne cotton known as catkins, from willow and poplar trees, and the gardening authority is trying to tackle them. The Beijing Gardening and Greening Bureau said it had stepped up efforts to curb the cotton-like seed clusters in key areas such as hospitals, kindergartens, schools, city parks and large residential areas. Beijing has 284,000 female willow and poplar trees, the main source of the flying catkins. About 37 percent of the trees are in Chaoyang district. With high survival rates, fast growth and low maintenance costs, poplars and willows were used as landscaping trees in Beijing, but flying catkins are a nuisance for the city and a fire hazard. Workers use high-pressure water guns to wash the cotton balls, and clip branches off high trees to prevent them from producing catkins. This year, they will not be using catkin inhibitors, because they do not work well, the bureau said. Grasslands are added to keep the flying cotton balls on the ground. Beijing will ban the plantation of female poplars and willows in the future and increase the diversity of landscaping trees. Zhang Jianguo, a researcher with Chinese Academy of Forestry, warned that though the trees produce annoying seeds, they can not be felled. Beijing's female poplars and willows were planted in the 1960s and 1970s, when there were few tree options for landscaping.
0	BEIJING - China's financial hub Shanghai outperformed other provincial regions in per capita disposable income in the first quarter of this year, official data showed. Average per capita disposable income in Shanghai reached about 17,277 yuan ($2,721.2) in Q1, the highest among China's provincial level regions, followed by Beijing and Zhejiang, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. China's average per capita disposable income stood at 7,815 yuan in the first three months, which rose 6.6 percent year on year. A total of nine provincial level regions outperformed the national average, including Beijing, Tianjin, Jiangsu, Guangdong and Shandong. Shanghai also overtook its peers in purchasing power, with residents spending about 11,102 yuan on average in Q1. Strong income growth and lifestyle changes in past years have helped China's consumer spending amid government efforts to shift the economy toward a growth model with more emphasis on consumption, the service sector and innovation.
0	Beijing's transportation watchdog has threatened to revoke the business licenses of retailers found selling electric bikes that break the government-set speed and weight restrictions. High-speed and oversized e-bikes have become a "severe threat" to public safety, according to a Beijing Daily report that cited sources with the capital's Transport Commission. China has banned e-bikes that can travel over 25 kilometers per hour, while the maximum designed weight allowed is 55 kilograms. However, many of the 4 million e-bikes on Beijing's roads are above the acceptable standards, the authority said. To tackle the problem, the capital ¡ª which has about 1,000 e-bike retailers ¡ª is to introduce tough measures to punish rule breakers. Starting July 1, those found selling oversized bikes or helping customers to illegally modify vehicles will be stripped of their business license. Substandard bikes and malfunctioning charging units can also cause fires, the city fire department was cited as saying in the report.
1	Nations improve multilateral exchanges and promote development of education  BRICS countries will continue taking measures to further strengthen multilateral exchanges and cooperation on education, according to a declaration signed in Beijing on Wednesday.  The five member nations - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - agreed to "reiterate support for the BRICS Network University to collaborate in the fields of education, research and innovation, and encourage universities to participate in the BRICS University League" in the Beijing Declaration on Education.  They also said they will encourage more teachers and educational administrators to learn from the experiences of other countries in improving teacher quality and performance, and promoting the development of education through international exchanges.  Senior education officials from member nations signed the declaration on Wednesday during the fifth meeting of BRICS education ministers.  They convened to summarize the achievements made in education cooperation among BRICS member nations during the past decade and to look into the future.  The previous four meetings were held in Paris, Brasilia, Moscow and New Delhi. The sixth will be held in South Africa.  Chen Baosheng, China's education minister, said in a speech at the meeting in Beijing that 10 years has passed since BRICS countries started cooperating with each other, and during the past decade BRICS has become a paradigm for cooperation among emerging or developing countries.  "In particular, the countries have continuously deepened cooperation in education and achieved important progress," he said, citing that more than 40,000 students from BRICS countries were studying in China last year, accounting for almost 10 percent of all overseas students in the country.  Meanwhile, about 13,000 Chinese students were studying in BRICS member nations, Chen said. By the end of May, China had approved 152 education institutions or programs established with BRICS countries.

0	A documentary focusing on the culture and social development of the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region has won the special recommendation award at the ongoing Beijing International Film Festival. The documentary, titled  was chosen for the award from more than 220 domestic and foreign films, including some award-winning titles, in a special section on documentaries during the festival. Produced by Beijing Television Station, Xinjiang will premiere on May 8 on Beijing TV. Some highlights of the six-episode documentary were played during the event and won warm applause from the viewers. Director Li Dan says to best present the true image of Xinjiang, the crew spent nearly 500 days on the whole filming process. Li's team traveled more than 30,000 kilometers, from the borders on Pamirs Plateau of more than 5,100 meters in altitude to the autonomous region¡¯s modern capital, Urumqi. Unlike some previous documentaries that focused more on Xinjiang's food or natural beauty, the new documentary sorts out the historical developments of Xinjiang's culture, ethnicity and religions to give the audience a better understanding of the region's past and present. The crew had chances to film quite a few treasured cultural relics and historical records that are not open to the public.
1	The Palace Museum in Beijing is working with universities to build China's first "medical school of cultural relics" and develop talent to protect and restore national treasures, says Song Jirong, national political adviser and deputy director of the museum. The museum now features a preservation center, the Hospital for Cultural Relics, with 23 analytical and testing laboratories, 16 restoration rooms and 161 professional restorers, according to Song, who is also director of the center. The relics will undergo scientific diagnoses to record detailed analyses of their composition, original use, damage, restoration history and preservation methods. This will be carried out so that further conservation work can proceed with minimum intervention. The museum's new year exhibition, showcasing ancient royal Spring Festival traditions, is currently on display, with a record number of nearly 1,000 exhibits until April 7.
0	Construction of the Beijing-Zhangjiakou high-speed railway is making smooth progress, with land requisitions and demolition work almost finished along the Beijing section, the city's urban development authority said on Wednesday.  The 174-kilometer railway between Beijing and Zhangjia-kou in Hebei province - scheduled to begin operating at the end of 2019 - involves a construction corridor extending almost 64 km from Beijing's downtown to its northwest Yanqing district, with the rest of the line winding through the mountains of Hebei.  With support from local governments, affected residents and construction contractors, 98 percent of the land needed along the line in Beijing has been acquired, and demolitions of buildings within the area are now complete, according to the Beijing Municipal Commission of Housing and Urban Development.  "Contractors now have no barrier to moving forward," said Zhou Hui, deputy director of the commission's railway engineering department.  The project, which kicked off in early 2016, is a key piece of transport infrastructure for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, which will be staged at three venue clusters - in Beijing's downtown, in Yanqing and in Zhangjiakou.  Once the 53.5 billion yuan ($7.8 billion) project is completed, it will significantly boost the local economy and people's livelihoods in the mountainous northern region by smoothing out traffic, local officials said.  "Residents are very supportive of the project and cooperate actively with us to move from their homes and deal with the reallocation procedure," said Cheng Zhimin, deputy director of the Yanqing Transportation Bureau.  Using the new railway, people will need only 20 minutes to travel from Beijing downtown to Yanqing, the proposed venue area for the Alpine skiing, bobsled and luge events of the 2022 Winter Games.  All 203 households from 20 communities in the construction strip in Yanqing had moved to temporary housing by April, emptying the area ahead of schedule for construction, according to the bureau.  "The primary concern was where we would live after the demolition," said He Qiuzhi, a woman from Dafutuo village, which is on the line in Yanqing.  Her six-member family has been allocated six apartments, along with 1.1 million yuan in monetary compensation.
0	A machinery enthusiast in Wenzhou village, East China's Zhejiang province, has made a fortune selling his own food-delivery robot on the Taobao e-commerce platform, through which the product has tapped markets in Beijing and Shanghai. Though Yang Yunlai stopped his education after graduating from junior high school, the 35-year-old always had a passion for machinery. He has worked as a mechanic, run computer and cellphone shops and even invented a robot able to slice dough. Even without family support at the very beginning, Yang managed to make a robot to serve meals. He spent two years figuring out how to fulfill the project, including exterior design, circuit outlines, material processing and product tests, which cost him hundreds of thousands of yuan. Last year, Yang finally finished. Yang's robot is priced 20 to 30 percent lower than its counterparts on Taobao. "Now my main focus is making robots, and I make other machines as well, which earns me 5,000 to 6,000 yuan ($726.26 to $870.38) each month," he said.

A replica of the residence with flowering crabapples in the garden outside the residence and the workplace inside the residence, will be a part of the set. According to scriptwriter Liang Bingkun, who has been working Beijing People's Art Theater for over 50 years, he wants to show a rarely seen side of Zhou. "I was honored to meet Zhou in person when I was a young scriptwriter with Beijing People's Art Theater. In fact, thanks to Zhou's support, the Beijing People's Art Theater was born in 1952," recalls Liang. "He liked watching plays at Capital Theater, where the Beijing People's Art Theater was based. And he also liked talking with actors after performances." Huo Qing, a veteran actor with the China Railway Art Troupe will play Zhou and actress Hao Yan will play Zhou's wife.
1	BEIJING - A new educational program was launched in Beijing Tuesday to help senior citizens avoid falling victim to Internet fraud. The program, initiated by China's Internet giant Tencent with the guidance from the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) and the office of the National Working Commission on Aging, will provide a series of online lessons, video clips and articles on how to avoid various Internet fraud. A report jointly released by Tencent and people.cn in June showed that 37 percent of senior netizens had been targets of Internet fraud. Credulousness and a lack of web knowledge have made middle-aged and elderly netizens more vulnerable to Internet fraud, said Chen Shiqu, deputy director of the criminal investigation bureau under the MPS, at the launching ceremony of the program, pledging more efforts to crack down on such crimes. China has been strengthening its forces for combating telecom and Internet fraud in recent years. In 2017 alone, Chinese police solved about 78,000 telecom and online scam cases.
0	The Beijing-Inner Mongolia (Hohhot) High-end Industrial Matchmaking Conference took place in Beijing on Dec 22. The event was attended by representatives from government in Inner Mongolia autonomous region and 104 enterprises in Beijing. Acting Mayor of Hohhot Feng Yuzhen and Vice-Mayor Luo Qing delivered speeches at the conference, recommending the city of Hohhot and the Horinger New Area. In his address, Feng pointed out that great achievements have been made in cooperation between Beijing and Inner Mongolia as well as between Hohhot in areas such as market exploitation, talent training, education, healthcare, technology and culture over the past 40 years. Feng said both Beijing and Hohhot were faced with historical opportunities to deepen cooperation, noting that Beijing has begun to transfer its non-capital functions to other areas. The city of Hohhot has exceptional advantages in undertaking industries transferred from Beijing. Some of the factors include its close proximity to Beijing, advantageous locations, sufficient talents, low cost and preferential policies, as mentioned in Feng¡¯s speech. He also expressed his wish that companies from Beijing could have more comprehensive and deeper understanding towards Hohhot through negotiation. On behalf of Hohhot government, Feng vowed to offer a preferential environment for investors in services like education, health care, housing, social security, sports and culture. The Hohhot government signed agreements with China Cyber Security (Beijing) Technology Co, Beijing Lanxum Technology Co and Zhongjian Investment Holding Co at the conference, followed by a road show by some companies.
0	Internet platforms are posing new challenges to tobacco control, with many advertisements masquerading as shopping experiences or sharing personal lifestyles. According to a report released by the Beijing Center for Diseases Prevention and Control on Monday, more than 51,800 tobacco advertisements or promotions were released online in the first half of last year. Of those, more than 80 percent contained contact information for tobacco agents. The data, collected by the Beijing CDC and Peking University, was collected between April 1 and June 30 last year on 14 major internet social platforms, including WeChat and Weibo. Although China enacted a regulation in 2016 banning tobacco advertisements on the internet, embedded marketing online - in which tobacco is featured in a personal shopping story or what appears as a discussion of lifestyle - has become a new trend. "Compared with traditional tobacco advertisements, such information, dressed up in readable personal stories, is more difficult to identify through regular online supervision channels," said Zeng Xiaopeng, deputy director of the Beijing CDC. The survey found that about 15 percent of the tobacco advertisements were embedded in stories about love, friendship and family, and presented tobacco to readers as a pleasant part of life. In Xiaohongshu, a lifestyle-sharing platform that encourages mostly young consumers to write reviews and share their shopping experiences, more than 90,000 references could be identified with the key word "tobacco". Many of the references involved the experience of buying a certain tobacco product or related goods. In the comment area, some writers also tell the readers how to purchase the tobacco. The report said that Sina Weibo had the greatest number - more than 80 percent - of the cloaked tobacco advertisements and promotions among the 14 platforms. A report released in March by Sina Weibo said that 75 percent of its users are between 18 and 30. "Moreover, women are the major subscribers to those lifestyle-sharing platforms. In other words, those tobacco advertisements online pose a bigger threat to the health of women and children," Zeng said. China, the world's largest producer and consumer of tobacco products, has about 350 million smokers, according to the Chinese Association on Tobacco Control. At least 500 million people experience secondhand smoke. "Cigarette smoking produces more than 50 harmful substances that will cause cancer," said Wang Ke'an, director of the Think Tank Research Center for Health Development, a nonprofit health research organization. He said women have a much higher risk of lung cancer or heart attack than men, given the same amount of cigarette smoke. So far, 18 Chinese cities have anti-smoking regulations, and the ban in Beijing is one of the toughest. Beijing's regulation, which took effect in June 2015, bans smoking in all indoor public spaces, workplaces and public transportation vehicles. Zeng said the Beijing CDC will continue to supervise online tobacco advertisements and release regular reports to the public. It will also further intensify public education on tobacco control.
0	Beijing has issued a blue alert for severe air pollution, which is forecast to peak on Tuesday and ease that night, the city's environmental authority said on Monday.  Air quality is expected to worsen to its second-worst level in Beijing.  Air will be bad all over North China, but pollution will be especially heavy in the city's southern districts because of geography and proximity to polluting industries, the municipal environmental monitoring center said on Monday.  Beijing issued its blue alert, the lowest level in the emergency response system, on Monday afternoon, suspending outdoor demolition activities at construction sites.  The disadvantageous weather, which makes it hard to disperse the airborne pollutants in Beijing and neighboring regions, is the major reason for the back-to-back days of heavy smog.  Since coal-burning heating services began on Nov 15 in China's northern region, Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei province and neighboring areas are required to step up restrictions to cut emissions, the Ministry of Environmental Protection said.  But in the northeast, other sources contribute, the ministry found - especially the burning of corn stalks.  From Sept 20 to Nov 15, satellites found 3,638 burning sites nationwide, an increase of 73 percent over the same period last year, data from the ministry's Satellite Environment Center showed.  Under high pressure from environmental inspections, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and neighboring provinces saw a sharp decrease. No burning sites were found in Henan province, the center said.  By contrast, the northeastern region worsened. In Heilongjiang province, the number of sites burning corn stalks increased by 41 percent during the period and was found to have increased nearly eightfold - although with only a handful of burn sites - in Jilin.  "For example, the satellites found 164 burn sites in Heilongjiang and 17 in Jilin on Nov 2," said Zhang Lijuan, a senior engineer working at the center, on China National Radio on Monday.  The latest data from the ministry showed that of the top 10 cities with the worst air pollution in October, Harbin, Heilongjiang province, ranked second in air pollution; Changchun, Jilin province, was eighth.  The soaring increase in the burning of corn stalks has become a major factor in air pollution, said Liu Youbin, a senior official in the ministry's publicity department after a news briefing on controlling air pollution in winter. The ministry sent inspection teams to monitor the situation and urge the governments to do more for cleaner air.  zhengjinran@chinadaily.com.cn
0	Youku, one of China's major online streaming media platforms, announced in Beijing on July 19 that its mother company, the Hangzhou-based Alibaba Group, had reached a strategic agreement with Suning Sports. The agreement will let the two sides to share copyright of sports broadcasts. Suning Sports, which is based in Nanjing, Jiangsu province, owns China's major online sports streaming platform PPTV. And it has licenses for the live broadcast of top-tier domestic European football leagues, the Chinese Super League, the AFC Champions League, and other football competitions. However, Youku, which is known for broadcasting producing online series dramas and variety shows, is a relevantly newcomer to the sports business. And it biggest sports foray was the recent 2018 FIFA World Cup when it spent 160 million yuan ($23.5 million) to get exclusive online broadcast copyright for the tournament on the Chinese mainland. According to Yang Weidong, the head of Youku, the deal between Youku and Suning Sports will also expand to many sports besides football.
1	More than 40 percent of left-behind children in China meet their parents no more than twice a year, according to a white book on the psychological conditions of left-behind children. The white book was issued on Tuesday by On the Road to School, a Beijing-based NGO, and a research team from Beijing Normal University. It was based on 11,126 valid questionnaires from rural children from Grades 3 to 8 in 17 provincial-level areas nationwide in the first half of the year. Only 37 percent of surveyed children had both parents working in their hometown. Twenty-seven percent had one parent working outside their hometown, while the remaining 36 percent were considered left-behind children who did not have either parent around as their guardian. About 40 percent of left-behind children didn't see their parents more than two times a year, the white book said, compared with nearly 45 percent in 2015. "That's still a big proportion," said Li Yifei, a professor at Beijing Normal University who led the research. "It's estimated there are six million left-behind children in China and they need a lot of care." According to the white book, left-behind children tended to enter a rebellious phase in Grade 5, one or two years earlier than children in standard families. "Children tend to study or imitate the behaviors of people close to them, but they are mostly not familiar with their parents," Li said. Liu Xinyu, chairman of On the Road to School, said "the emotion gap between the two generations resulting from long-term separation cannot be easily bridged." The report called for more communication between parents and left-behind children. Many of the parents work in the construction industry in big cities, so some construction companies have also tried to contribute to improving that communication. Wu Guohui, a public relations officer at China Construction Second Engineering Bureau, said, "Thousands of parents of left-behind children work in our company and we plan to invite some of their children to witness their work on site." Wu said he thought that would help children to understand their parents' hardship and make them closer. Support from schools is also needed. "Children who lack parental company are often not confident in handling things and getting on well with others," Li said. "So, schools can provide more platforms for them to prove and show themselves."
0	Construction on the site of the Beijing World Horticultural Expo and accessory infrastructure are almost finished, and the site will be put into trial operation on April 5, Zhou Jianping, executive deputy director-general of the Beijing World Horticultural Expo Coordination Bureau, said. The bureau's staff are now working around the clock in preparation for major events to be held during the expo, including the opening ceremony, said Zhou, who also is a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee, China's top advisory body, on the sidelines of the body's annual session that ended Wednesday in Beijing. The expo, to be held in Beijing's Yanqing district from April 29 to Oct 7, is expected to receive 16 million visits from people around the world, he said. As of now, 110 countries and international organizations have confirmed they will attend the expo, Zhou said. "Plants will be the major role of the expo, and through the expo we hope to spread ecological concepts and present a harmonious relationship of interdependence between man and plants,"he said. The expo also will promote exchanges and understanding between different countries and improve China's horticulture, he said. A special garden with the Belt and Road Initiative as the theme will be presented during the expo, he said. More than 100 gardens featuring characteristics of various countries and different regions in China, with 1,200 kinds of plants, will be presented during the expo, he said. In addition, more than 2,500 various cultural events will be held, he added. Some of the expo's facilities will be reused for the Winter Olympics, which will be held in Beijing and neighboring Hebei province in 2022, he said.
0	DAVOS, Switzerland - US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Tuesday he was optimistic that US-China trade talks would have a good outcome and the two countries could "thrive and prosper together." "There are those who say that conflict, superpower conflict between our two countries is inevitable. We don't see it that way. We want to find places where we can work together," Pompeo told the World Economic Forum participants via video link. Pompeo canceled his trip to Davos due to the current US government shutdown. Commenting on the next round of US-China trade talks, Pompeo said he was optimistic that the Chinese delegation would be well received and both sides would "have a good outcome from those conversations." The Chinese Commerce Ministry said last week that Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will visit the United States on Jan 30-31 for trade negotiations. When asked whether effort to resolve the US-China trade friction could achieve any breakthrough, Pompeo said that he was hopeful that each of those issues could be dealt with constructively. "I don't want to get ahead of the conversations and negotiations that are taking place. There is lots of hard work to do," he said. "I am very confident that there will be a bright future for the United States and its people, but for the Chinese people as well," he added. Washington imposed steep tariffs on Chinese imports worth billions of dollars last year,prompting retaliatory tariffs by Beijing. The two sides have conducted several rounds of talks to resolve their trade frictions since US President Donald Trump first announced tariff plans against China in March last year. Leaders of the two countries agreed at a meeting in the Argentine capital city of Buenos Aires in December to halt additional tariffs and resolve their trade dispute via talks.
1	Can you go for 21 days straight without losing your temper? A challenge of going 21 days without losing your temper, which was set as homework for a class of third-grade students and their parents during the summer vacation in Wuhan, has suddenly become an internet hit, reports the Beijing Youth Daily. The homework was set by Cheng Hong, the head teacher of the first class of the third grade in the Zhonghua Road Elementary School in Wuhan's Wuchang District. Attention was immediately drawn to the special homework after it was shared on the internet, despite the summer vacation having ended weeks ago. Some netizens commented that 21 hours is already a long time let alone 21 days, while other doubted the necessity of the challenge. Cheng told the Beijing Youth Daily that the aim of the challenge was to remind parents about the importance of ensuring a good domestic environment for children to be able to learn to manage their emotions. Based on the "diary-like" recordings of the 44 students in the class, only one set of twins and their parents completed the challenge. Cheng says she found that parents were more likely to get angry than the children, with 80 percent of the disputes originating from the children's homework. Many parents who participated in the challenge were cited as saying that they have learnt the importance of managing their emotions on a daily basis as this will have a major effect on the children's emotions. One mom has also reportedly come up with innovative ways of managing the bad emotions in the family during the challenge. In this family, the balcony was chosen as the place to calm down and penalties will be given to the ones who lost temper, according to the Beijing Youth Daily report.
0	Prices of high-end properties in Beijing will see a steady rise in the second half of this year due to a supply crunch, industry insiders said. "Owing to the government's tightening of real estate policies and the tepid market since last year, quite a number of high-end projects in the capital postponed their entry into the market, thus reducing supply," said Li Xiang, senior research manager at Savills, an international real estate services provider. Demand from wealthy people for improved living standards, however, will not be much affected, and the value of high-end residential products will continue to appreciate, according to Anthony McQuade, managing director of Savills for the Northern China market. "Fundamentally, there is still a strong demand," McQuade said. Beijing's pre-owned home market saw online transactions for 18,096 units in May, reaching a 14-month record high, industry data showed. Volume was up 32.3 percent month-on-month and 67.5 percent year-on-year, the first time that the pre-owned home market in the capital experienced such rises. According to real estate agency 5i5j, the average sale price of a pre-owend home also increased by 0.6 percent compared with the previous month. "In the near future, a modest rebound might be possible," said McQuade. With the market stabilizing, an increasing number of high-end projects are expected to enter the market. Shimao Group, a Hong Kong-listed property developer, for instance, is going to launch its luxury villa project Loong Palace in Beijing this month. Liu Hui, vice-president of Shimao Group, said it is the company's top project, but did not disclose the prices of its flats. Hong Kong-lised The Wharf (Holdings) Limited, Greentown China Holdings Limited and China Communications Construction Company Limited are also going to launch a luxury project called One LiangMa along the capital's northeastern Fourth Ring Road. This is the first time that the three leading property developers are working on a high-end project. Li Liang, vice general manager of Financial Street Holdings Co Ltd, said market demand is strong, but sale prices of homes will probably remain stable in the rest of the year, restrained by existing policies. "The current sale prices of new homes are not a real reflection of the supply and demand equation, due to the existing tightened measures," said Li. Financial Street Holdings, together with Tian Heng Group, is going to launch the latest phase of a new residential project along the capital's South Fourth Ring Road. The unit price could be lower than 80,000 yuan ($12,698) per square meter. The project's earlier phases were sold for 6.3 billion yuan over the past three years.
0	A report by China Central Television, China's state broadcast network, Tuesday shows a crisscrossed transport network will take shape in the Xiongan New Area in the future. Upon completion of several high-speed railways, intercity railways and highways, travel time between Xiongan to both Beijing and Tianjin will be reduced to 30 minutes and between Xiongan to Shijiazhuang, capital of Hebei province, will be 60 minutes. And it will take only 20 minutes for people in Xiongan to arrive at Beijing's new airport in Daxing district. The report came on the heels of a conference on coordinated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, held in Beijing the same day. According to the conference, the development of transport infrastructure and ecological and environmental projects are expected to accelerate in Xiongan New Area, Xinhua reported. Presiding over the conference, Vice-Premier Zhang Gaoli highlighted the importance of the area, a new economic zone about 100 kilometers southwest of Beijing designed to integrate the capital with surrounding areas. Thanks to a concerted effort by experts, the framework plan for Xiongan New Area has basically taken shape, he said. It is necessary to launch a group of key projects at a proper time and accelerate the development of transport infrastructure and ecological and environmental projects in the Xiongan New Area, Zhang said. It is also important to invite more domestic and foreign talent to participate in the creation of Xiongan and formulate investment, finance, tax and land policies supporting the development of the area, he added. China announced plans in April 2017 to establish the Xiongan New Area, which covers Hebei province's Xiongxian, Rongcheng and Anxin counties. The country aims to "develop forward-looking plans and adopt high standards for building Xiongan New Area", according to the report of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in October.
0	Technological innovations such as models of China's manned submersible Jiaolong, bullet trains and interactive robots impressed foreign diplomats and experts working in Beijing who toured an exhibition in the Chinese capital on Friday. "Judging from what has been done in the past five years, we can already say that the next five years are going to be even more successful," Rwandan Ambassador to China Charles Kayonga told China Daily. The guests were invited to Beijing Exhibition Hall to have a closer look at China's recent achievements. As of Friday, the exhibition, Five Years of Sheer Endeavor, had racked up a total of nearly 480,000 visitors since it opened on Sept 25. Many residents have lined up for tickets to the display, which includes models of China's cutting-edge machinery and equipment that are rarely put on display. It employs virtual reality technology as well as panoramic slideshows to enhance the experience. "China is now becoming a country that's more of an innovator rather a country that relies on the technology of other nations, so that is a very good sign," said Edwin Maher, a visiting professor of journalism studies at the Communication University of China. "It has been made very clear that China is very much leading in many, many sectors of world technologies and science," said Maher, who has been in China for 14 years and was once a news anchor on China Central Television's English Channel. Around a decade ago, Maher was awarded the Friendship Award, the highest honor that a foreign expert or outstanding achiever can receive from the Chinese government. "The huge telescope that's been opened and the continuing development of the high-speed train system are also some things I am very interested in," he added as he toured the displays. Maher said that over the past year and a half, measures taken to improve the environment have really been felt in China, especially in Beijing. Science and technology were only a small part of the exhibition, which features 10 themed zones, including economic progress, political reform, cultural development, environmental protection, Party discipline, diplomacy and military reform. Uzbek Ambassador to China Bakhtiyor Saidov said that China has hosted of a range of major international events. "China's diplomacy has made remarkable progress," he said.
1	Fourteen girls involved in bullying have agreed to take part in a five-day training course in Beijing in order to return to school. The course, organized by Tongzhou District People's Court, aims to show students who have received criminal or administrative punishment for bullying the severity of their actions and help change their behavior. The girls are all age 15 to 17 and include one who was given a suspended prison sentence of a year and   months. The court did not release further details to protect the minors' privacy. "All of them attended military training on Monday, and they will take part in other activities during the week, such as listening to lectures and receiving psychological support," said Wei Dan, a judge from the court. The course runs until Friday. "All activities are conducted under the supervision of the students' schools and their parents," she said. "We hope they can learn how to communicate with others and realize the impropriety of their earlier behavior." Wei said attendance was voluntarily, and that teachers would review the students' performances during the week before the girls were allowed to return to school.
0	A surge of internet attacks across the world has highlighted the role of cybersecurity.  In May, the Wannacry ransomware virus reportedly affected hundreds of thousands of computers in more than 150 countries and regions including China.  The bug wreaked havoc in around 30,000 institutions, such as universities, hospitals and research centers, as well as gas stations.  With threats like this on the horizon, Zhang Jian, deputy secretary-general of the Cybersecurity Association of China, has warned of the online risks.  He stressed that personal computers, or PCs, and mobile operating systems on smartphones were vulnerable to cyberattacks via remote access to devices.  This in turn would put at risk not only personal details but reams of company data.  "A great deal of people use smartphones as electronic wallets to pay for commodities and services," Zhang said.  "Open interfaces make the smartphone a leading target for hackers to obtain access to both payment transfer details and users' personal information," he added.  Zhang also called for increased vigilance and preparation by government departments and business enterprises, as well as individual internet users.  A better reaction mechanism was needed to contain an online virus, he pointed out.  Earlier this year, China released an emergency response plan for cybersecurity incidents to prevent and reduce the damage of an attack on public services and national security.  The new plan divides cybersecurity incidents into six categories, including pernicious procedural incidents, cyberattacks and information security incidents.  It also defines four-levels of security warning and response systems, according to different threat conditions from "general" to "extremely serious".  Getting to grips with the problem will be crucial as other countries around the world have found out to their cost.  Li Tiejun, a security engineer at Cheetah Mobile Inc in Beijing, felt awareness of cybersecurity was still vague compared with mature markets in Europe and the United States.  "With the boom in smartphone users, viruses, worms and cyber criminals are now targeting mobiles, which put users at the forefront of cybersecurity," Li said.  A report published in May by the Internet Society of China and the National Network Emergence Response Technical Team-Coordination Center, showed that more than 2 million mobile internet malicious programs were detected last year. Nearly 99.9 percent were targeting the Android system.
0	Spring Festival, the most important holiday for Chinese, is setting new trends as technologies transform people's way of life. Besides the traditional celebrations such as family reunion dinners, sending "red envelopes" and paying a New Year call, new traditions such as collecting five blessings on payment platform Alipay to win cash rewards, giving and grabbing digital "red envelopes" on instant messaging app WeChat, and doing special purchases for the holiday online are taking roots. Here are six moments showing how common Chinese people spent their Spring Festival holiday in the mobile internet era.,To have a relaxing holiday rather than to deal with overzealous relatives who are too interested in his personal life, Ji Xuan chose to travel to Vietnam during the Spring Festival.

0	Beijing-based artist Yin Xiuzhen, 55, is known for utilizing everyday objects, such as used clothes of her own and those she collects from others, in creating her work, something that distinguishes her feminine sensitivity. She used secondhand clothes of black, gray and white in a 6-meter-high installation, titled Trojan, which stood as the centerpiece of her exhibition at Pace Beijing earlier this year. The towering work depicts a figure braced-for-impact on an airplane, stirring discomfort and an unsettling feeling within the viewer. Conversely, people can walk into the installation via a door at the rear, and the spacious interior gives them a comforting sense of safety, like that of an unborn child in the womb. With this piece, Yin points to the loneliness, insecurity and anxieties that haunt individuals in our modern society. Yin also made an artistic material from a river as a way to dwell on the relationship between humans and nature. In a performance piece from the 1990s, entitled Cleaning River, she gathered water from a polluted river in Chengdu, Sichuan province, and froze it into ice cubes. She transported them back to the riverside, and asked people to brush the ice clean. Yin's work brings these unnoticeable materials, which often encapsulate private experiences and demands, to the public's attention. Her approach exposes people to the paradox that one takes delight in a highly developed, material world, yet, at the same time, cherishes the simplicity and peace of a lifestyle rooted in the past. People will find a similar sentiment in Yin's recent presentation, Walking, Thinking, a beautiful, serene forest of 500 pairs of hanging shoes that occupy a whole exhibition hall at Museum of Contemporary Art Yinchuan in the Ningxia Hui autonomous region. The single-installation exhibition is the seventh installment of the museum's "made in China" project£­where it invites one artist to produce site-specific work using local materials£­through which the museum hopes to encourage people to think about the truly valuable ideas of Chinese culture and philosophy. Yin says she collects used clothes as a way to collect people's varied memories. For this exhibition, she and the museum launched a campaign among Yinchuan's residents months earlier to donate a pair of shoes they feel especially attached to.,Shoes are the bearers of people's bodies and experiences; they show a person's aesthetic views, as well as the choice of his or her life's path, Yin says. Around 600 pairs of shoes were delivered to the museum, and Yin chose 500 of them. They are of men and women, the young and the elderly. Some have the patina of age upon them, like they're no longer being used, while others look fashionable and expensive. The shoes were cleaned and dried, and each pair is suspended by a long fabric rope£­which varies in color from white, pink, nude and brown and was tailor-made in Beijing and transported to Yinchuan. "The ropes were produced to look like our legs," Yin explains, "but they are of exaggerated length to symbolize that, as we keep walking, our experiences grow." People were asked to write the stories of the shoes they chose to contribute to Yin's work and, as visitors walk deeper into the forest of "legs", they will find a standing glass box in the middle of it. Inside, there are a selection of the notes written by the shoes' owners that Yin finds touching and thought provoking. Li Yiman, 34, one of the footwear donors, wrote about how she tracked down a pair of girl's plastic sandals in the style of the 1980s. Li runs a coffee shop in the city of Wuzhong, a 40-minute drive from MOCA Yinchuan, which she frequents and where she first learned of Yin's project. Li wanted to donate the pink sandals she wore a lot during her childhood, but they had been thrown away. With the help of a friend in Shanghai, she found a similar pair which cost her 300 yuan ($43). "When I opened the delivery box and saw the shoes, I was overwhelmed by my happy childhood memories," she says. "Suddenly I felt a bit unwilling to give the shoes away. I wanted to hang them in my shop." Yin observes: "People sent us not only shoes but warm, and sometimes lost memories that could be shared, together, with honesty." She says we still feel lonely even among others. "Every lonely soul is like the fabric leg in this forest. We move forward through these shoes, it is like we encounter different people in society. We observe each other, feel each other and try to find empathic emotions." Zhang Yun from MOCA Yinchuan's publicity department says that many owners say the shoes mean so much to them and ask if they can be returned after the exhibition ends. Song Dong, Yin's husband and an established artist in his own right, spent a week at the museum helping complete the installation. "You can find in this forest of shoes the changes of time and the course of history, also you can feel the differences between men and women and gap between generations in the way they view relationships, fashion styles and consumption," he says. "It is as if we step into someone else's walk of life, and then we try to think the way they do, comparing it with ourselves. This process truly shows the enchanting side of art." 10 am-5 pm, Tuesday to Sunday, through Dec 30. 12 Helu Road, Xingqing district, Yinchuan. 0951-8426-111.
0	China's commitment to opening-up and win-win collaboration is very exciting for international companies, including GSK, said Emma Walmsley, CEO of GlaxoSmithKline, at the sidelines of the China Development Forum in Beijing on Saturday. "I am absolutely delighted to be here. I think it (the China Development Forum) is wonderful. This event has been going on for 20 years. You get a really strong sense of how China is committed to opening-up and win-win collaboration. There is a lot of discussion of teamwork and partnership, so that's very exciting," Walmsley said. As a healthcare company, GSK is very excited to see how deregulation has been progressing in China over the last two years to really drive forward support for more innovationto come through and they expect that to continue. Walmsley said what was also exciting in China is how innovative the country is becoming in its own right, particularly when you think about the digital China agenda and the country's new capabilities in AI and machine learning. Through a real openness to partnership and shared learning, more achievements will be made altogether, Walmsley added. In terms of intellectual property protection, Walsley also recognized China's real commitment to continue to make progress on these kinds of issues - which matter for many industries - and emphasized mutual trust is important for sustainable innovation and investment.
0	The 2018 Beijing Tianqiao Musical Awards ceremony was held at Beijing Tianqiao Performing Arts Center on Dec 27, with over 10 musicals honored through awards in three major categories. The Best Musical Award was presented to the shows      and . Three performers -- Yang Zhuqing in  Tian Yifan in and Li Xiang in   -- won the Best Performing Award, dazzling musical aficionados with their skilled renditions. Additionally, the production teams of seven musicals received the Best Production Award. Leaders from the China Musical Association and Beijing Tianqiao Performing Arts Alliance expressed their heartfelt congratulations to the winners and sincere thanks to the organizer Beijing Tianqiao Performing Arts Center. "Thanks to the more than two months of fantastic shows staged during the third Beijing Tianqiao musical performance season, we have witnessed the emergence of more outstanding original musical works in China," said Yang Xiulan, vice-president of Beijing Tianqiao Performing Arts Alliance. "And the success of these shows has benefited from our country's increased support and attention to the domestic musical industry, as well as growing interest from the general public," Yang added. The Beijing Tianqiao Musical Performance Season represents one of the most influential musical events across the nation, and is held every two years. Twelve brilliant musicals, 34 amazing shows and 40,000 audience members constitute the latest musical season, which ran from October to December last year. The season offered a visual feast through a wide variety of genres, such as traditional culture, world classics, popular culture, ethnic customs, love and affection, and technology and fantasy. Launched in 2014, the musical award sets out to celebrate China's original musical productions and to introduce world classics to China at the same time.
0	The National Theatre of Northern Greece will make its Chinese debut with its theatrical production version of Salvatores Dei (Saviours of God), based on Greek author Nikos Kazantzakis' book of the same name. Directed by Andreas Koutsourelis, the production will be staged at Mong Man Wai Concert Hall at Tsinghua University in Beijing on May 10 and 11. The show will be performed with both English and Chinese subtitles. The upcoming show in the capital is part of the ongoing 18th Meet in Beijing Arts Festival, the city's largest annual festival, which celebrates dance, music, drama and art. The event is attended by nearly 800 artists from 44 performing arts groups which hail from 19 countries and regions. According to Maria Tsima, deputy director of National Theatre of Northern Greece, the show premiered in Thessaloniki, Greece, in January 2017, as part of the "Kazantzakis Year" celebrations, dedicated to the work of the writer, widely considered to be a giant of Greek literature. Since then, it has toured all over Greece, being performed in ancient amphitheaters as well as upon contemporary theater stages, where more than 40 shows have been enjoyed by as many as 12,000 people. Salvatores Dei, published in 1927, is a series of essays, which is divided into six parts: Prologue, The Preparation, The March, The Vision, The Action and The Silence.,"Andreas Koutsourelis was inspired by the significant philosophical work of Kazantzakis and strongly believed that it should be made known to a wider audience," explains Tsima. "Although the work is not a theatrical play, it is a text rich in meanings that express the metaphysical faith of the great writer. "Kazantzakis himself argued that the whole work is an expression of his anguish to overcome the borders of the mind and to solve the mystery of existence," she continues. "The Greek drama preserves and unveils very old myths, archetypical human behaviors, truths and secrets of existing in a community with others and facing what is beyond human power: fate. "These plays have survived through the centuries, have inspired artists all over the world and still touch audiences, because they present important ideas in the most simple way, unaffected by time, culture or fashion," Tsima observes. Kazantzakis was nominated for the Nobel Prize in literature in nine different years. In 1935, he visited China for the first time as a journalist. He returned for a second visit in 1957 shortly before he died on October 26 that same year in Freiburg, Germany. According to Luo Tong, a translator and scholar of Greek literature who was based in Athens and moved back to China in 2017, the staging of the play is a major watershed for Greek theater in China. "As far as I know, this is the first time that a theatrical production based on Kazantzakis' work is to be staged in China," says Luo. A love of Greek literature runs in Luo's family. His father, Luo Jinlin, 80, graduated from the Central Academy of Drama in Beijing in 1961, and has been researching ancient Greek plays and adapting them into Chinese since the 1980s. He adds that Greek dra-ma is rarely staged in China and the translation of such plays also needs to be developed in the country. Luo Jinlin's father, the late Luo Niansheng, who studied in the United States and at the American School of Classical Studies in Athens, started translating ancient Greek literature in 1933.
0	A high-speed railway station will be constructed in Xiongan New Area, turning the planned megacity into an important transportation hub,   reported citing a policy advisor on Thursday. Xu Kuangdi, director of a council of experts for coordinated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, made the remarks at a forum in Beijing on Tuesday. Upon its completion, it will only take 41 minutes to travel from the Xiongan New Area to Beijing. The government announced plans to establish Xiongan New Area in April as part of measures to integrate Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei development and cure "urban ills" such as traffic congestion and air pollution in the capital. The overall planning program for Xiongan New Area is expected to be completed by the end of this month before submitting it to the central government to review, said Xu. Xu said the construction of the new area should focus on a more efficient transport network, environmental protection, urban and rural integration and innovative urban planning. Xiongan New Area plans to build an underground infrastructure network, putting urban transportation, water, electricity, gas, disaster prevention systems underground, Xu added.
0	The Beijing Summer Olympic Games in 2008 arguably pushed Chinese sports to a pinnacle-and while the legacy of those Games lives on, the contribution to the country's sporting success by overseas Chinese is equally unforgettable. A special exhibition running at the Overseas Chinese History Museum of China not only honors the 10th anniversary of the Beijing Olympics but also cheers for sports heroes who sail across the sea and bring glory to their homeland. Through the display of 60-odd exhibits, plus 216 pictures, Overseas Chinese and Chinese Sports unpacks an album of exciting moments. "Overseas Chinese were exposed to modern sports earlier (than people in China)," Qi Degui, deputy director of the museum, says. He adds that many schools in overseas-Chinese communities in the early 20th century also included sports in their syllabuses and thus helped nurture influential sports teams. "After the founding of New China (in 1949), a large number of overseas-Chinese athletes came back to China," Qi says. "They brought advanced training methods and techniques. They accelerated the development of the country's sports in many fields. "And overseas-Chinese entrepreneurs have invested in infrastructure in their hometowns and have also helped sports grow in China." That explains why some places in southeastern China-areas with a large number of Chinese emigrants-are the cradles of some modern sports in the country. Taishan, Guangdong province, is nicknamed the "home of volleyball in China"; Meixian, Guangdong, is referred to as the "home of soccer", while Jinjiang, Fujian province, is known as the "home of basketball". Among the figures featured in the exhibition, Chinese people are probably more familiar with Tan Kah Kee (1874-1961), an overseas-Chinese tycoon with a wide range of business in Southeast Asia, who donated a huge sum of money to Fujian, improving education facilities, including sports arenas. However, visitors may also be surprised to find some famous Chinese athletes are of overseas origin: Rong Zhixing, who's considered one of the all-time greatest Chinese soccer players, returned from India when he was a child. Many overseas Chinese returned from Indonesia in the 1950s and created the foundations of sports like badminton. For example, Fang Dingxun (1906-2006) visited China in 1953 and later chose to settle down, promoting badminton nationwide. He organized the first national badminton team of New China. And Hou Jiachang and Tang Xianhu, who were both born in 1942, swept the world's badminton circuit by beating a number of former and incumbent world champions in the 1970s. Although they were unable to participate in the Olympic Games (because China only returned to the International Olympic Committee in 1979), they were often hailed as "champions without crowns". The duo later became coaches of China's national badminton team and cultivated superstars like Lin Dan. Tao Jinhan, a former fencing athlete, returned to China from Indonesia in 1953. The 83-year-old became emotional when he introduced some of his sports equipment that's part of the exhibit. "When I saw the Chinese national flag raised on the arena," he recalls, "it was difficult to describe how excited I was. It's great to have such an exhibition introducing the history to more people." Tao became the first Chinese fencing athlete to win a gold medal in an international competition in 1966, before becoming the first international-level fencing judge from China eight years later. "I want to persuade more schools to open fencing classes so that it's more widely practiced in China," he says. Tao started a fencing course at Peking University and soon after helped the students to form a fencing association. He only retired from tenure earlier this year. One section of the exhibition also looks at the close emotional connection overseas Chinese have with the Beijing Olympics. A wall of Chinese newspapers from abroad reveals overseas-Chinese people's pride when Beijing won the 2001 bid to host the Olympics and successfully held it seven years later. Huge banners also reflect their best wishes and solid support. "Many Chinese people also move abroad to improve the communication between different cultures and the development of sports in other countries," Qi points out. For example, former Chinese gymnast Qiao Liang, who relocated to the United States, coached a large group of US gymnasts, including Shawn Johnson. Chen Longcan and Wei Jingguang, the men's double table tennis athletes who won gold at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, moved to Japan after retirement and promoted sports communication between the two countries. They are among many examples listed at the exhibition. All exhibited items have been donated by individuals. Overseas Chinese and Chinese Sports will run until Oct 14(closed on Mondays). Qi also hopes that the event will inspire more overseas Chinese to donate their collections and share their stories in the future. 0
0	The retreat from a potential trade war between China and the United States is beneficial for both countries and global economic development, said Liu Xiaoming, China's ambassador to the United Kingdom, on Monday. Liu was addressing more than 100 representatives from the business, political and academic sectors at the London-based think-tank Asia House. "For China, this outcome is in the interest of achieving high-quality economic development, and meeting the growing consumption needs of the Chinese people. For the US, this outcome will cut the trade deficit, and support growth and employment," he said. His remarks came after two days of "positive, pragmatic, constructive and fruitful" talks in Washington between the Chinese and US government representatives, led by China's Vice-Premier Liu He, and US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. In a joint statement on Saturday, the countries agreed to take measures to reduce the US trade deficit in goods, with China significantly increasing purchases of US goods and services, which will help support growth and employment in the US. These agreements have put a stop to the previously threatened trade war, which began earlier this year with US President Donald Trump planning to impose tariffs on up to $150 billion of Chinese goods, and China considering similar retaliatory steps. Central to the bilateral tension is the existence of the US's $335 billion annual trade deficit with Beijing. Trump has also accused China of infringing US intellectual property, such as technology and copyright. Liu said that while the dangers of a trade war have abated, recent events deserve deeper reflection. He gave China's trading partners several suggestions for the development of win-win trade relations. Liu said it is important to stop being suspicious about China and see its development objectively. He stressed that China is still a developing country with its own problems and challenges. However, it is committed to pressing ahead with reform and opening-up, processes that will provide many opportunities for its partners internationally. This year marks the 40th anniversary of China's reform and opening-up, which began in 1978. In the four decades since then, China has become the world's second-largest economy and the largest contributor to world growth. China will continue to open up. As soon as major measures are being implemented, this will create more opportunities with the world, Liu said. Elsewhere in his speech, Liu stressed the importance of deepening the results of win-win collaboration, urging the US to treat Chinese products equally and fairly so that both countries can exercise their respective strengths to achieve mutual benefits. He also stressed the importance of following international rules rather than domestic laws in international trade, and urged the international community to recognize China's real progress in intellectual property protection over the years.
0	The 2019 Cross-Straits Esports Culture Festival recently expanded its presence to Beijing with a public class on the inspirations provided by Chinese traditional culture to popular video games. The three-month event, which kicked off in Shanghai on April 17, will feature a variety of activities for e-sports aficionados in Taipei and Kaohsiung as well. The Beijing event, which took place in Tsinghua Science Park on May 27 saw around 100 experts, researchers and industry insiders as well college students. Most of the public class speakers said that the diversity of Chinese culture had become a rich resource for domestic video game designers. For instance, the popular video game Happy Fish has a number of characters inspired from Peking Opera, Shan Hai Jing (the classic of Mountains and Seas) and some of China's intangible cultural heritage. Tencent's Honor of Kings, China's highest-grossing mobile game in 2018, had a deal with the Dunhuang Research Academy for a female character from Dunhuang's world-known   (flying goddess) murals. Sun Jiashan, a researcher from the Chinese National Academy of Arts, said the passing on and use of cultural legacies should end the myth that pop culture is against high culture. He added that video games, which have a huge and fast-expanding market, could also be exploited as a medium to convey traditional values and promote traditional culture.
0	Beijing and surrounding areas have been mostly blessed with blue skies this winter, after massive reductions in air pollutants. But that may change this month as the wind dies down, according to forecasts. The weather in late January and mid-February is unlikely to help in dispersing pollution, with temperatures expected to be above average compared with the past 30 years and less snow, the Ministry of Environmental Protection said on Wednesday. This means the air will stay stable in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, with less wind and a greater risk of smoggy days. "In December, the temperature in China was 1 degree higher than average (for the past 30 years), and other indicators show this winter may have been warmer," said Song Wenling, chief forecaster for the National Climate Center. In response, "local governments need to strengthen pollution controls to further cut emissions and make sure they reach their goals on air quality improvement", the ministry said in a statement. Twenty-eight major cities in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and the neighboring provinces of Shandong, Shanxi and Henan set targets to cut air pollution from October to March and reduce winter smog. Based on these targets, the average PM2.5 concentration was to fall by up to 25 percent year-on-year, according to the ministry. "All the cities saw a dramatic decline in PM2.5 levels from October to December, meaning they all met their reduction targets," the statement said. PM2.5 refers to fine particles with a diameter of 2.5 microns that are hazardous to human health and is one of the major indicators of air quality in China. Shijiazhuang, Hebei province, saw a 54.1 percent reduction in PM2.5£­the largest among the 28 cities£­according to ministry data. Next came Beijing with 53.8 percent. In the capital, the average daily PM2.5 level was a record 49 micrograms per cubic meter, the same as in summer. To reach their targets, local governments introduced measures such as phasing out polluting companies and placing restrictions on coal consumption. The ministry also sent inspectors to cities to search for environmental violations and supervise local environmental protection officials, releasing the results on a daily basis. The latest inspection results show that 32 of the 861 companies visited on Tuesday across the 28 cities had breached regulations, including eight factories that had not installed facilities to reduce emissions, the ministry said.
0	The "Forgive Barbecue" located in 798 Art Zone, Beijing, is a startup project for hearing-impaired people. Different from other places, this "silent" restaurant welcomes customers with a guide card reading "welcome, how many people?" with order cards and tablets displayed on each table. Although staff members are unable to speak with customers, they understand customers' requests through a simple facial expression, an action, or even a look. When the requests are complicated, the employees use writing tablets. Customers feel good about this kind of communication; with many of them even leaving notes on the message board praising the staff members. As one of the employees said, the restaurant is a bridge to connect hearing-impaired people with other people. Employees get a chance to learn about the society and have their own careers.
0	BEIJING - The impact of Sino-US trade frictions on China's balance of international payments is "overall controllable," an official with the country's foreign exchange regulator said Thursday. There will be no change to the situation that China's international payments under the current account are becoming more balanced and remain in a reasonable range, Wang Chunying, spokesperson for the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, said at a press conference. While the possibility of quarterly fluctuations cannot be ruled out in the short term, steadiness is expected in the longer term, she told reporters. "On the whole, with trade of goods becoming more balanced, China's international payments under the current account will stay basically stable within a reasonable range," Wang said. While the country has a deficit in service trade, the deficit growth may slow down in future as demand for overseas travel and study peaks and Chinese service exporters become more competitive amid upgrading efforts, she said. Returns on outbound investment are expected to increase as the investment structure improves, which will reduce the investment income deficit China runs under the current account, Wang said. China's international payments under the current account have been basically balanced in recent years, with the current account surplus accounting for 1.3 percent of China's GDP in 2017, according to Wang.
0	The People's Liberation Army has published its first regulation governing military training, a move observers said will effectively boost the PLA's combat capabilities. The regulation was signed by President Xi Jinping, who is also chairman of the Central Military Commission, and will take effect on March 1, Xinhua News Agency reported on Monday. The report said the regulation is the first of its kind for the Chinese military. It aims to improve training inspections and ensure that PLA units focus on combat capability, the report said. The regulation's 10 chapters and 61 clauses specify the duties and major tasks of training inspectors and prescribe the proper procedures and methods of inspection. Wu Peixin, a military observer in Beijing, said the regulation is expected to enable the PLA to better supervise units' training. "Currently, the training of PLA units is examined and supervised by higher authorities, mainly based on those authorities' own rules, which are more or less different from each other," he said. "With the regulation, training will be organized and supervised with a unified set of standards, so it will be improved." Wu said the regulation stresses the importance of combat capability and urges units to make training as realistic as possible. Its implementation will help to build a stronger and more battle-ready PLA, he said. A military observer in Shanghai, who asked to be identified as Yang, said the PLA has put combat-ready exercises and joint operation capabilities at the top of its agenda, so it needs a regulation to make sure all forces conduct training in accordance with strict, unified standards. Xi has repeatedly ordered the military to improve its training so that it can fight and win a modern war. At a Central Military Commission conference in Beijing in early January, he urged the military to be fully aware of the nation's security and development trends; to strengthen the troops' awareness of crises, challenges and combat; and to make comprehensive preparations for military operations. Xi told the meeting that the armed forces must focus on improving their combat capabilities, and that whatever they do must align with that objective.
0	Silk Street, a shopping center in Chaoyang district, Beijing, is a must-see for international tourists. Now, in addition to a shopping spree, foreign tourists can also get a touch of traditional Chinese culture thanks to the new culture and travel experience center that opened on July 30. Organized by Beijing Jinshubiao Tourism Development Co., the center is titled "Amazing China". According to the CEO Zhang Jinqiang, this kind of center aims to help foreign people get a closer look at Chinese fine culture and transform Silk Street into the one-stop Chinese culture and tourism destination. "It has been 10 years since China started to develop inbound tourism. During the past decade, tremendous changes have taken place in the industry. Tourists are not contented with going around the city and seeing some beautiful scenic areas. Instead, they hope to have a deep touch of the city. "For example, they want to interact with local people and experience the daily life of them. Also, they are very interested in knowing Chinese unique culture and appreciate Chinese chic. That¡¯s the reason why ¡®Amazing China¡¯ was born," Zhang added. At the center, three parts have been set up for visitors. Chinese-style fashion shows will be held regularly. Foreign people can wear Chinese traditional clothes and catwalk on the stage. The one-stop cultural experience pavilion has been established for people to learn Chinese art such as calligraphy, poetry and painting. The last section is an exhibition and store of cultural and creative products, a place to find traditional Chinese souvenirs.
0	As the Olympic spotlight shifts to Beijing following the Games in Pyeongchang, the Chinese capital has beefed up efforts to produce a sustainable Winter Olympics in 2022, with its legacy underlined as a key requirement for post-Games success. Since the curtain fell on the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in the Republic of Korea last month, Beijing has taken center stage to prepare for its own version of the sporting gala against the backdrop of a national plan to build a burgeoning winter sports industry leading up to 2022 and beyond. The country's commitment to hosting an excellent Winter Olympics and Paralympics, and using the showcase event as a boost for sporting participation, was highlighted in the annual Government Work Report delivered by Premier Li Keqiang at the opening session of the 13th National People's Congress on March 5. "China will make thorough preparations for the Beijing Winter Olympics and Paralympics, and multiple channels will be used to raise the number of sporting venues and facilities available to the general public," Li said, when he presented the report. Highlighted as a milestone in the country's sporting and social development by the central government, the 2022 Winter Games will be held at three zones£­downtown Beijing, Yanqing district, in the northwest of the capital, and co-host city Zhangjiakou, Hebei province. The zones are expected to lead sustainable planning and operations, not just for sporting events but for urban development in general, according to deputies and political advisers attending the two sessions. After heated discussions during the National Committee session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, members of the sports panel of the top political advisory body agreed that preevent planning for infrastructure construction, venue management and staff training for the Games should take account of local demand and the environment. "Even with four years to go until the 2022 Games, we have already started to take into consideration what will happen next after the Games," said Li Yingchuan, a CPPCC member and vice-minister of the General Administration of Sport of China, the country's central sporting governing body. "Since winning the bid for the event, we have instilled the mindset of always considering what will be next and will carry that through the entire preparatory and delivery stages of the Games." Yang Yang, a retired Olympic champion speed skater and a member of the Beijing 2022 organizing committee, echoed Li Yingchuan's points, saying that the sustainability featured in the plan for Beijing 2022 is its biggest selling point. "The International Olympic Committee has put great emphasis on adapting future Games in the hosts' regional development plans," said Yang, whose eight-year term as a member of the International Olympic Committee ended last month. "It is important for us to leave a legacy through practical planning and prudent operation so we can set examples for reform of the IOC." Carrying the Olympic flag from Pyeongchang, Beijing wasted no time meshing the gears for 2022, as the organizers announced that construction of all venues and infrastructure is well underway. "All construction will be completed by the end of next year and will be ready for a series of test events in 2020," said Zhang Jiandong, vicemayor of Beijing and executive vice-president of the Beijing 2022 organizing committee. Zhang, who is also an NPC deputy, added that the capital will launch a global competition for the design of the 2022 mascots soon. Although hosting the Olympic Games usually presents a heavy workload, the groundwork for Beijing 2022 will be effortless, thanks to the legacy of the 2008 Summer Olympics. According to the organizing committee, there will be 26 competition and noncompetition venues in the three zones. Of the 12 venues in Beijing's downtown, where all the ice events will be staged, 11 were built for the 2008 Summer Games or earlier events. Landmark 2008 venues, including the National Stadium, better known as the Bird's Nest, the National Aquatics Center, aka the Water Cube, and the Wukesong Arena, will be repurposed to host events such as ice hockey and curling, in addition to acting as media and broadcasting centers in 2022. The only new permanent venue in the Beijing downtown zone will be the National Speed Skating Oval for long-track speed skating, scheduled for completion next year. It will feature post-Olympics operations involving private stakeholders for public skating, hockey games and entertainment events. "Beijing 2022 can set a new benchmark for sustainable Olympic Games£­on the one hand benefiting from the legacy of Beijing 2008, while on the other developing your winter sports facilities in a sustainable way," said IOC President Thomas Bach during Pyeongchang 2018. As a new competitor and organizer in snow sports, the mainstay of the Winter Olympics, China will face stiff challenges in producing Olympic-standard facilities for snow events in Yanqing and Zhangjiakou by 2022, and ensuring that they are busy after the Games. Though China has set a target to involve 300 million people in winter sports by 2022, the relatively small number of participants at present and a lack of international skiing competitions mean ensuring post-Olympics use of the facilities is a tougher mission than preparing them for the Games. "Rather than regarding it as a challenge, we'd better embrace it as an opportunity to make up for the lack of winter sports facilities to meet the growing public demand for more diversified exercise activities," said Yang, who was appointed chairwoman of the athletes' commission of the Beijing 2022 organizing committee in November. Chongli district in Zhangjiakou, where most of the snow events will be staged, has integrated preparatory work for the Games into a plan to develop the mountainous region£­home to seven commercial ski resorts£­into a skiing and winter tourism destination. Of the 76 projects for 2022 in the region, 43 are under construction and a further 22 will get underway this year, while work will start on the remaining 11 venues next year, according to Wu Weidong, mayor of Zhangjiakou. "To not only meet demand for the Games, but also the future industry, we still have to improve a lot in terms of high-level competition management, energy supplies, medical services and accommodation for snow sports," said Wu, an NPC deputy. Advisers also stressed that the complexity of venues for highly technical events, such as ski jumping and alpine skiing, requires planning for post-event operations, based on local conditions and international expertise. Citing the ski jumping hills at the training center at the Pajulahti Sports Institute in Finland as an example, Shen Jin, a CPPCC member, said the facility for 2022 should cater for functions other than just the ski jumping event. "It's always difficult to use the high towers and long ramps after the competition. More options for future use in terms of sightseeing, exhibitions and leisure activities are necessary," said Shen, deputy director of the planning and sustainability department of Beijing 2022. The alpine skiing course, which is being built on Xiaohaituo Mountain in Yanqing, needs about 1,300 people for venue management, event services and medical support, but there are few suitable individuals in China, according to Wang Yanxia, deputy director of the sports department of the Beijing 2022 organizing committee. To learn this sophisticated line of work, including producing densely packed artificial snow courses and providing alpine medical services, the committee sent 41 staff members to the IOC's Secondment Program to gain hands-on experience by working alongside local hosts at multiple snow venues during Pyeongchang 2018. "We can afford to hire experienced staff members from overseas for the 2022 Olympics, which will guarantee operations," Wang said. "But our goal is to take the opportunity to train as many local experts as possible. They will become the human legacy of our winter sports industry."

1	A Beijing preschool employee has been given a suspended prison sentence for buying fake documents to hire unqualified foreign teachers, Legal Evening News reported on Monday. The defendant, surnamed Xia, obtained forged degree certificates and supporting documents for two foreigners ¡ª from Serbia and Ukraine ¡ª early last year to allow them to work at his kindergarten in Tongzhou district. In exchange, he paid 16,000 yuan ($2,535) to an employee surnamed Wang at an agency that prepares paperwork for overseas teachers who want to work in China. The scam was uncovered after the documents were submitted by Xia¡¯s assistant to the State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs, where officials suspected they were forgeries. Police detained the pair in August. Xia, 32, and 35-year-old Wang both received eight months in prison, suspended for one year. Both decided not to appeal the verdict, according to the report. The two foreigners have since left the country voluntarily, while the kindergarten has been ordered to rectify and improve its recruitment practices.
0	Nestle China on Monday unveiled a new research & development center in Beijing and a system technology hub in Shenzhen to accelerate its trend-based innovation in the country, aiming to get closer to consumers and get products quicker to market. The new R&D center in Beijing focuses on creating new food and beverage products primarily for Chinese and Asian consumers. Nestle CEO Mark Schneider said: "We are strengthening our local R&D capacities so that our team can work faster and more efficiently to turn great ideas into the latest must-have products for consumers in China." Stefan Palzer, executive vice-president and chief technology officer of Nestle, said globally Nestle rolls out 1,500 new products each year. About one-third of them are updated each year and the speed is increasing. "In the old days, it took us about two to three years to develop a new product. Now it takes a couple of months or even weeks," he said. Nestle last year invested about 1.7 billion Swiss francs ($1.7 billion) in R&D. It has about 30 R&D centers worldwide. Its R&D expenditures in China have seen changes in the types of investments being made. It has invested in how to get products developed and tested quickly in the Chinese market by locating its facilities in the proximity of markets, top universities, local entrepreneurs and startup environments, as well as suppliers. The Shenzhen System Technology Hub, with locations near beverage machines and system manufacturers, allows Nestle to rapidly turn new ideas for beverage systems and components into reality. "The new sites in China will change our way of working," said Palzer. He cited an example of how products can be developed only in two or three days from a new idea and tested in nearby supermarkets, receiving feedback quickly. Palzer is also impressed with the digital connections in China in terms of digital payment, food delivery model and AI. "Bringing that (experience and know-how) to the other parts of the world is a big opportunity for us," he said. Safety, nutrition, taste, sustainability and affordability are basic requirements for Nestle to develop research of each new products, he said. But on top of that, "it is about addressing the trends in China" and get consumers excited about their products, he said, "given the young consumers want varieties, new things each week". Palzer also said the coffee, pet food and dairy products for middle-aged and senior people are their priorities when it comes to research, boosted by the immense market potential in the three categories. Zhu Danpeng, an independent food and beverage analyst in China, added that while the coffee market in China will keep growing over the next 10 years, pet care is entering a high-growth period, and an aging society in China brings more opportunities to companies with food products and healthcare products for senior people. Zhu said the new R&D center and hub will allow Nestle to compete with its rivals with more products and to better meet the demands from younger generations of consumers. "As one of the world's largest food and beverage producers, Nestle manages to remain big but flexible and sensitive to the local market, constantly addressing Chinese consumer's needs accurately and efficiently."

The grapes also sold to other cities like Beijing. The 48-year-old man plans to develop the 600 mu (40 hectares) of land into a grape farm with numerous functions, including a production base, a place for sightseeing and a vocation resort where people can gain farm experience. Apart from grapes, strawberries, cherries and blueberries are also planted on the farm, while more than 700 chickens are raised here. The farm is preparing to provide barbeque services this October.  In addition, a 10,000-square-meter racecourse, a 3,000-square-meter camping base and 600-meter fishing area along the river are all under development.
0	A vast array of online literary genres has revolutionized the entertainment industry in China and triggered a new wave of TV dramas, movies, animations and gaming titles. Stories and plots from aspiring authors are now read by millions of internet readers across the country before being turned into films, television series or cartoons. Smash-hit dramas such as Nothing Gold Can Stay and Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms were spectacular adaptations from popular online stories, highlighting this booming new business. "Online literature will become the mainstream in the future," said Dong Qianqiu, general manager of the literary division at iQiyi.com, at an entertainment conference earlier this year. A report released by the China Internet Network Information Center, or CNNIC, showed a growing number of people are reading e-books on mobile devices rather than PCs. About 353 million Chinese users are hooked on online stories, with 327 million reading e-books on smartphones. Figures from the CNNIC have backed up this internet boom. Among the 751 million netizens, 96.3 percent were mobile phone users, providing a massive base for the online book business. As for age groups, millennials have become big fans of online literary works and the spinoff movies, TV series and games. High-definition smartphones, and innovative mobile internet technology and software have made on-screen reading and video-watching cool again. So cool, in fact, that consumers are willing to pay for it.,  "Before, the majority of internet users preferred to pay for real items," said Xue Yongfeng, an analyst at internet consultancy Analysys in Beijing. "But with an increase in average incomes, more Chinese are willing to pay for content, such as reading online novels, watching online videos or listening to online music," he added. Naturally, this has attracted the attention of the three major internet players, Baidu Inc, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and Tencent Holdings Ltd, or BAT. The trio have invested heavily in entertainment, betting big on China's booming markets. Already e-commerce giant Tencent has spun off its online literary arm, China Literature Ltd. It listed the e-book publisher on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in November, with its share price jumping more than 86 percent to HK$102($13) on its debut. This was the largest global first-day gain for an initial public offering this year. "Supported by the mobile internet and a number of digital technologies, reading is no longer confined by the limits of time and space," said Zhu Jing, vice-president of e-book publisher China Literature. "We are now entering a brand new age that embraces the online reading trend." Founded in 2015, the online publishing subsidiary has 6.4 million writers on its books and 9.6 million literary works by the end of June. China Literature also has 191.8 million monthly active users across its platforms and channels. Last year, the company announced that revenue reached 2.6 billion yuan ($378 million), up 59.1 percent from the previous year. It also saw a significant jump in gross profit to 1.1 billion yuan during the same period, an 81.7 percent year-on-year increase. "We are building an international open platform aimed at offering better user experiences as we seek new momentum in key markets," Zhu said.,  China Literature's open platform enables developers to include its content on their apps, which will create new revenue streams. So far, it has partnerships with nearly 50 e-book platforms, including Baidu and JD.com. The company has also launched a multi-language site to translate some of the most successful online novels in China for overseas readers. It aims to take its multibillion-yuan business globally. As the online entertainment ecosystem continues to mature, there are huge possibilities out there in cyberspace. During the past two years, China Literature has sold the rights of authorized online novels to companies that are part of its 100-strong client base. Many have been made into movies, TV dramas and online games. This synergy across different entertaining platforms has prompted Baidu and Alibaba to expand into the online literary business, as they try to catch up with rival Tencent. The plan is to share online content and develop quality IPs or copyrighted material. "The internet not only works simply as a medium but also appears fashionable and trendy," said Dong of the literary division at iQiyi. "With more than 300 million users who love reading digital literature, the market is worth 10 billion yuan in China and will boost more pan-entertainment industries," Dong added.
0	An exhibition to mark 100 years of the May Fourth Movement opens to the public in Beijing, Cheng Yuezhu reports. The New Culture Movement Memorial of Beijing is holding an exhibition to commemorate the centenary of the May Fourth Movement, an anti-imperialist campaign in China in 1919. With historical artifacts, publications and photographs, the exhibition entitled A Panorama of the May Fourth Movement, which opened to the public on April 23, recounts how students and workers at the time got together to demand national independence and seek reform. On May 4, 1919, more than 3,000 students joined a demonstration in Beijing to oppose the Beiyang government's (1912-28) signing of the unequal Treaty of Versailles. Displaying 180 historical photos and 11 artifacts, the ongoing exhibition comprises five sections in chronological order, from the student demonstrations on May 4, 1919, to China refusing to sign the peace treaty with Germany in June that year.,"The newspapers and magazines at the time sympathized with the patriotic activities of the students and published illustrations advocating the upholding of national sovereignty. They rejected the treaty and criticized the Beiyang government," Qin Suyin, one of the curators, writes in the China Cultural Relics newspaper. "Such materials are popular with visitors (at the exhibition). They give a vivid picture of the May Fourth Movement and allow people to get a sense of that era," Qin adds. The Beijing exhibition not only displays Chinese publications at the time but also includes 18 photographs by the late US photographer Sidney D. Gamble, with support from the Duke University Libraries in the United States. The show runs through June 9 at the exhibition's venue-the Honglou, or Red Building, at the former site of Peking University. Construction started in 1916 and was completed two years later. The building is described as the cradle of the May Fourth Movement, from where the founders and early leaders of the Communist Party of China, including Li Dazhao, Chen Duxiu and Mao Zedong, worked to disseminate Marxism and pushed forward the revolutionary campaign.,The movement also led to the reorganization of the Kuomintang. Chen and Li founded the Weekly Review magazine in the building in 1918. It published news on the movement. Several editions of the magazine are on display at the exhibition. According to Qin, the building witnessed the movement in its entirety. "I believe there is no other venue that can bring the audience into the scene of the May Fourth Movement as realistically." In 1961, the building was listed in the first batch of major national-level protected historical and cultural sites. It was turned into the New Culture Movement Memorial of Beijing and opened to the public in 2002. As a landmark of China's modern history, the building is also one of the most popular sites. According to the memorial's administration office, the site has received more than 50,000 visitors so far this year-over four times the number of the same period last year.,The memorial saw a surge in visitor appointments after President Xi Jinping's speech about strengthening studies on the movement and its spirit. The memorial has registered 231 appointments for May, which amounts to an estimated 10,000 visitors. Apart from visiting the exhibition, students and other groups are also seen taking an "oath of allegiance"-to inherit the spirit of the May Fourth Movement and continue to strive for national rejuvenation-in front of the building.

0	Beijing authorities have begun soliciting public opinion on a draft rental policy aimed at protecting the rights of tenants. The draft, however, has caused anxiety that rents in the capital would rise as it guarantees the education rights of tenants' children in schools around rented homes.  According to the draft, which was published by Beijing housing authorities on Thursday, Beijing's local governments should increase the supply of houses available for rent around industrial parks and on collectively-used land.  The newly-built houses should be rented to those working in the industrial parks or in the vicinity, and the area should be equipped with educational and medical facilities.  "For these newly-built areas with no medical facilities within a five-minute walk, medical facilities should be set once the population in these areas reaches a certain number," said the draft, without specifying what that number should be.  An online supervisory platform will be set up, which will provide house rental information, electronic rental contracts and applications, and supervision of transactions, the draft said.  The draft also guarantees the education rights of tenants' children in schools around rented homes.  It said Beijing residents who do not own houses can apply for their children to receive compulsory education in the area near their rented home, provided that they have lived in the area for at least three years and one of the couple has worked in the area for at least three years.  Non-Beijing residents can also apply for their children to receive compulsory education in the area of their rented houses, according to the draft.  Currently in Beijing, children usually cannot be admitted into schools unless their parents own houses in the area. To guarantee children's admission into key schools, many parents have to buy houses nearby, which has made housing prices near these schools extremely high.  Many netizens have shown anxiety over rising rent as it will be much cheaper to guarantee children a high-quality education by renting a house than buying one, and this could offer house owners near key schools a good reason to raise rents.  "I couldn't afford a house in Beijing. If the draft is passed, I'm afraid I won't be able to afford to rent one," commented one netizen on Sina Weibo. Many netizens also shared the same anxiety.  Yan Yuejin, research director of the E-House China R&D Institute, said it's "highly possible" that the change will result in rising rents.  He estimated that in the final version of the policy the Beijing government will only guarantee the education rights of children of tenants who rent government-subsidized or company-owned apartments, and tenants of privately-owned houses will not enjoy the policy.  Beijing residents renting government-subsidized housing such as public rental houses can have their hukou, or household registration, registered and transferred to the houses, the draft said.  In May, Beijing authorities said they would increase the supply of houses for rent within the next five years, and that 500,000 new houses would be built.  houliqiang@chinadaily.com.cn
0	Spring has come. The 700 metric tons of sturgeon farmed in East China's Qiandaohu Lake by Kaluga Queen are expected to spawn and produce one of the world's most expensive gourmet delicacies - caviar. Weighing 10 to 12 percent of a fully mature sturgeon, which is usually 7 to 15 years old depending on the species, these unfertilized roe are to be retailed at a maximum of 180 yuan ($28.6) per gram, more than half of the price of gold. Kaluga Queen is the world's largest caviar producer, breeding sturgeon in the 573-square-kilometer lake in Zhejiang province. Though most of its caviar products are for export, the company is trying to whet the appetite of 1.4 billion Chinese for the "food of the czars" in the coming years. Founded in 2003 by several former aquaculture researchers from Beijing, Kaluga Queen, named after the sturgeon species dwelling in Northeast China's Heilongjiang province, surpassed Italy's Agroittica Lombarda SpA as the world's biggest producer of caviar in 2015 with its production reaching 45 tons. Over the years, its caviar has found its way into the first-class cabins of Lufthansa and 22 of the 28 Michelin three-star restaurants in France. In 2016, it was served at the banquet for world leaders at the G20 Summit in Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang province. In 2017, the Quzhou-based company's output reached 70 tons, representing around one-third of the global total and consolidated sales of 207 million yuan. Almost 90 percent of its output is exported to Europe, the Middle East and the United States. But the company hopes that over the next five years, the situation will reverse, with Chinese citizens consuming up to 90 percent of the total, said Xia Yongtao, deputy general manager of Kaluga Queen, who admitted it might be "an unreachable dream". If the "dream" is realized, however, the company's revenue and profit will surge, as selling domestically means cutting out middlemen and benefiting directly from consumers. "Unlike wine or other industries that are seeing stagnant if not negative growth in Western markets today, the supply of caviar is largely outnumbered by demand globally. But we still believe the mine of the black gold lies in China," said Xia, who has been with the company since its founding.,Xia and Wang Bing, founder of the company, were part of a research team funded by the Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences that helped make sturgeon farming possible in the late 1990s. Li Jun, director of the China Sturgeon Association, gave a more modest prediction. He estimates that by 2020, China will consume 100 tons of caviar every year, accounting for one-third of the world's total. Caviar will be an accessible treat for not only the wealthy, but also the middle-income group, he added. The association is formed by dozens of companies involved in the business, including sturgeon farming, processing and feed manufacturing. Li noted that there are no more than five companies in China capable of managing a complete supply chain of caviar, which starts from sturgeon breeding and concludes with the final packaging of the delicate roe. The consumption of caviar began to pick up in China around 2012, but the bud was nipped the next year due to the anti-graft campaign introduced by the central authorities, which prohibits luxury dining and gift giving with public money. In 2016, as the fine dining scene gradually revived and Michelin launched its first restaurant review on the Chinese mainland, piquing keen interest in restaurants at an average cost of 300 yuan and above, caviar consumption started to gain momentum and soared at a growth rate of 50 percent annually, according to the association. Traditionally, caviar production depends mostly on wild fishing by countries surrounding the Caspian Sea, primarily Iran and Russia. According to a report by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the worldwide catch of sturgeon reached its peak in 1977 at 32,078 tons, which translated into 2,000 tons of caviar.,Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, however, global caviar supply has undergone a drastic decline. The long-established sturgeon and caviar management system gradually weakened, resulting in rampant illegal fishing and habitat degradation. Today, global caviar production remains steady at around 200 tons a year and largely comes from artificial breeding, as several sturgeon species have been classified as endangered since 2000. The classification resulted in a ban on wild fishing and at the same time triggered commercial breeding to boom. "It's a lucrative business, but also one that poor people cannot afford to start and rich people disdain to join, considering the investment time required for the fish's maturity and egg production," Xia said. With an initial investment of around 6 million yuan, mainly from several founding partners, Kaluga Queen harvested its first batch of caviar in 2006 and started to widely market it the following year, when China's food-safety problem was at its peak. "At first, we were treated with such bias that once they heard it's 'Made-in-China', people would turn us down immediately without opening the can and having a taste," Xia recalled. After attaining several top winner titles at caviar blind tasting events and exhibitions with its high quality, Kaluga Queen had its first breakthrough, becoming the supplier of Lufthansa's first-class cabins in 2011. Today, the company is expected to keep a double-digit growth rate, with production reaching 100 tons in 2019. While the growth is seen evenly in both retail and partnership with fine dining restaurants and luxury hotels, Xia thinks there will be growing potential in retail as more Chinese consumers get their first bite of the roe. "Our strategy is to work with as many restaurants as possible in China, turning them into our tasting rooms to deliver our roes as extensively as possible. Once the foundation is built, we will reduce the retail price, say by 5 percent, to get millions of consumers hooked," he said. Kaluga Queen is now the exclusive supplier of caviar for around 500 restaurants and hotels in China, but most of them are Western-style restaurants. "The way and amount of caviar being used in Chinese cuisines currently only represent a tip of the iceberg," said Xia, whose team is now working closely with Chinese fine dining restaurants including Da Dong, the roast duck chain, and Xin Rong Ji, the seafood chain, to develop new dishes using caviar. Meanwhile, the company's research and development team is also working to use other parts of the fish, including sturgeon fillets, marrows and skin for leather products, though caviar will remain the chief money-spinner for the company, Xia added.,Just one decade ago, Chinese consumers were stocking imported food and formula milk powders amid the country's incessant food-safety issues. However, the past decade has also witnessed a growing number of premium Western food producers from both China and abroad locating their manufacturing bases in the country, and labeling their pricey products "Made in China", in an attempt to feed the increasing appetite for a taste of luxury. French group Euralis, which produces nearly a quarter of the foie gras consumed in France, first entered the Chinese mainland in 2007, setting up a farm in Beijing. Late in 2012, the farm was destroyed in a snowstorm. In 2014, the company announced a new plan to rebuild a rearing farm together with a processing plant and commercial structure in Lianyungang, Jiangsu province, at a cost of 15 million euros ($18.4 million). The facility is expected to raise one million geese by 2020, and supply mainly to luxury hotels and restaurants in Shanghai and Beijing. "This is a market that is experiencing strong growth. In China, foie gras is cropping up more and more in the fine-dining industry and we firmly believe that it will become an ingredient in Chinese cuisine," said Guy de Saint Laurent, director of Rougi¨¦ China, Euralis' subsidiary. Southwest China's Yunnan province is known as the home to more than 250 types of mushrooms. Black truffle is one of the most expensive varieties that is sold for 130 yuan ($20.7) to 1,300 yuan per kilogram. Production is estimated at around 200 metric tons every year, with the majority being exported overseas. A highly fragmented industry supported mainly by individual farmers and wholesalers, the black truffles harvested in Yunnan are generally considered to be of lower quality than their peers from P¨¦rigord£­the finest in France£­mainly because they are usually picked hastily before they are fully matured. But their much lower price, often just a fraction of the European varieties, has led to them being used more practically and widely by chefs and cooks. Liu Yang, 44, is known as Mr Cheese among expats and gourmands in Beijing. Having studied international trade in France for a couple of years, the former information technology engineer started his own cheese factory in Beijing in 2009, as he had a personal penchant for the dairy product and found a wide supply-demand gap in the local market. Branded as Le Fromager de Pekin, his business today provides a variety of 20 or so cheeses. The skills and equipment to make cheese are imported from France, but Liu uses locally produced milk for his cheese, which has found its way into the fridges at the French embassy in the capital.

0	For contributions promoting Chinese books and writings to global audiences, 20 international authors, translators and publishers were honored in Beijing with the Special Book Award of China on Tuesday.  The ceremony, with Vice-Premier Liu Yandong presenting the awards, also marked the opening of the 24th Beijing International Book Fair, in which some 1,000 book events will be held from Wednesday to Sunday.  The fair, the world's second-largest, has attracted 2,500 publishers from 89 countries and regions, and they brought 300,000 titles.  One of the winners was British translator Paul White, who has been working with China International Publishing Group for 31 years.  Among the books he worked on are Xi Jinping: The Governance of China and The Chinese Path and the Chinese Dream.  "I stay here because of the huge changes China has experienced," White said.  White said Chinese culture presents topics that are popular with global audiences. But as interest grows, international readers also want to read about China's progress in technology and politics.  Alicia Relinque Eleta, the Spanish translator of The Peony Pavilion, received an award for her long dedication to making Chinese classics available to the Spanish world. "When I was pursuing the Chinese language in the 1980s, people thought I was crazy. But Chinese culture had the magic to cheer up a middle school teacher of mine, who had never smiled at us until after a trip to China."  From that moment, Relinque Eleta said, "I've dedicated my life to pondering the best Spanish rhythms to convey the Chinese original".  Lebanese publisher Mohamad El Khatib has cooperated with 20 Chinese publishers to present 100 Chinese titles in his native market.  "From the books, the Lebanese people see they share the same values with Chinese, especially in family and relationships with kids," he said.  Zhao Haiyun, of the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television, said the winners, selected from more than 200 candidates, "have greatly contributed to spreading Chinese culture as well as Chinese stories to the world".  Established in 2005, the award has honored 88 such writers, publishers and translators from 40 countries.  Zhao said this year, 10 of the 20 winners are from countries involved with the Belt and Road Initiative, "a sign of much closer publishing cooperation with those countries", he said.  The initiative is also the featured topic for the Beijing International Publishing Forum, an annual key gathering held one day ahead of the book fair held on Tuesday, attracting publishers from home and abroad to share insights into global publishing exchanges.  Wu Shangzhi, deputy minister of the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television, noted that copyright trade with countries involved in the Belt and Road Initiative has grown by 20 percent since 2014.  Wu also said the Chinese publishing industry grossed 2.3 trillion yuan ($350 billion) in 2016, a 9 percent year-on-year increase.  Wang Yiwei, professor at Renmin University of China in Beijing, said of the forum: "The Belt and Road Initiative is a promise Chinese leaders made to the world: not only will China achieve its rejuvenation, it will encourage these countries to rejuvenate and thus create shared prosperity for all."
1	Classes at a center for autistic children in Beijing have been suspended after surveillance footage showed teachers physically abusing the students. Two teachers at the Senxi Education center in Changping district have been fired due to "grave errors" and another are expected to follow after the police finish their investigation, the person in charge of the center, surnamed Han, told the Beijing News. Footage from classroom surveillance cameras was made public last week at the request of parents after they found bruises on their children's bodies, according to the report.  The video shows one teacher forcing a child to squat by pressing a hand on the child's head and another teacher dragging a child around using a rope. After watching the footage, parents reported the matter to the police and classes were suspended. According to Senxi's website, it is a research institute that applies brain science research in its education practices for autistic children. The center enrolls children aged 2 to 6 with impaired perception and coordination abilities.  A teacher at the school told Beijing News that 10 of the 41 students have been removed from classes since the footage was released. Han said the center would reflect on existing problems.
0	After successful staging in China of Dream of the Red Chamber, Canadian impresario plans to take it on a major tour of Europe. Andrew Moody reports. As a Canadian classical music impresario, Wray Armstrong might cut an unlikely figure in the projection of China's soft power. The 67-year-old, however, was the man behind the recent hugely successful staging in China of Dream of the Red Chamber, based on the classic Chinese novel. And he plans to take it on a major tour of Europe in the summer of 2019. He believes it is the sort of project that fits into the message about the importance of promoting Chinese culture sent out by President Xi Jinping in his report to the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in October. "President Xi has been very strong about culture and soft power, and following on from the congress we are looking at taking it to Europe," he says. Armstrong, an imposingly tall figure, was sitting behind an enormous desk in his new office at the North Pingod Arts Community in Beijing. The table is made out of a 100-year-old Chinese country house door, which is now encased in toughened glass. "I had it made by a carpenter in the Gaobeidian district of Beijing where we get a lot of our props for historical dramas. They had to put it together in my office. It is a bit of an artistic statement," he laughs. Armstrong is chairman of Armstrong Music and Arts, which he founded in the Chinese capital in 2009., He represents a number of the world's leading classical music artists, including the Polish composer and conductor Krzyszt Penderecki, the pianist Helene Grimaud and violinist Joshua Bell. He also represented the Czech conductor Jiri Belohlavek until his death earlier this year. Staging Dream of the Red Chamber in China though was his biggest success so far. The production of the opera, composed by Chinese-American Bright Sheng and with a libretto by Sheng and Chinese-American scriptwriter David Henry Hwang, is not Chinese but that of the San Francisco Opera. "It wasn't produced for the China market but by San Francisco Opera, which has a strong commissioning program and tends to commission something by a Chinese artist every five years or so. "Its board of directors really hoped it would come to China and we were one of two or three agencies who bid on the project." There were six performances in total, two each in Beijing, Wuhan and Changsha. The first performance at the last venue marked the opening of the Changsha Meixi Lake International Culture and Arts Center designed by the late British architect Zaha Hadid. "In Changsha the acoustics were brilliant and the look is completely different and wonderful. The center looks like orchid blossoms when seen from above," he says. Although it was a US production, many of the artists had to be hired in China. "The San Francisco orchestra was in season and they don't have a double orchestra or chorus like, say, Vienna (Philharmonic and State Opera). So we auditioned with the composer and hired the best young Chinese singers. They had all trained in London or worked in Berlin," he says. All the performances were a sell-out with Wuhan's being broadcast on local television; and now Armstrong is looking to stage the opera in Shanghai next year before heading for Europe the following year. "If we could do between six and 10 centers that would be unbelievable. We would like to do the music festivals in Berlin and Amsterdam, the Proms in London, although the Royal Albert Hall (the main Proms venue) is not an opera house, and maybe the Edinburgh Festival and the Proms in Warsaw," he says., He says San Francisco Opera prefers his company to stage a European tour even though it is outside China. "They know and we also know it would require an incredible fund-raising effort, which would be easier inside China than organized from San Francisco. Both the Chinese Central Opera and the Hangzhou Philharmonic would be very interested in cooperating with us and we hope we might get some government support." Armstrong was brought up in a musical family in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. His mother was a good amateur pianist and his father played an accordion and had a traditional dance band.  He studied languages at university and went on to be a translator for the Federal Translation Bureau in Ottawa. "On the third day of the job as a translator I knew it wasn't going to work - just translating what people said with no viewpoint." In the late 1970s he managed to get the job of assistant manager at the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, where he eventually became managing director working alongside musical director Andrew Davis, now best known for his association with the Proms in London. In the early 1990s, he became managing director of the London operations for the leading US arts management company ICM Artists, where he worked with Isaac Stern, who had made the film Mao to Mozart about classical music returning to China after the "cultural revolution" (1966-76). In 1999, he moved to IMG Artists, where he headed up the key classical music projects at the Beijing Olympics. He has had a close working relationship with the famous Chinese conductor Yu Long since the late 1990s and was an adviser and consultant to the Beijing Music Festival. It was when IMG wanted to set up a Beijing office that he decided to go it alone and set up his own agency. "I had a serious discussion with the head of IMG and decided I wouldn't work for him and that I would work for myself. They wanted me to operate here how the New York office thought and that just wasn't right for China," he says. Moving to China was a bold move for someone who was already in his late 50s but it has proved successful.,"What was important was to have Chinese business partners who know how to deal with Chinese business people. In the first few years I had a lot to learn," he says. Bringing top orchestras to China can be a logistical nightmare, transporting artists and their instruments. "The maestro always travels first class and the players in the top orchestras business class. This often means they have to travel over two days because there is not enough room for them all in the business class of a single airliner," he says. He believes Chinese orchestras are now bridging the talent gap between themselves and major Western orchestras as Japanese orchestras have succeeded in doing. "Chinese orchestras are doing rather well now. For them to be the equivalent of the Berlin or Czech Philharmonic we are probably still looking at 20 years from now," he says. "The actual playing talent is strong everywhere. The only difference to me is the interpretation and the traditions of interpretation." He says China suffers also from something of a brain drain of its musicians. "Many Chinese youngsters go to the Curtis (Institute of Music in Philadelphia) or the Juilliard (School in New York) or the Royal Academy of Music in London and don't come back. There are top Chinese players in the Berlin and the New York philharmonic orchestras." Armstrong says he continues to be impressed by the range of the sheer number of music events across China. "There is an incredible range of orchestras, chamber music, dance and also musicals being brought here right across China. It is very exciting to be part of it all."

The route now runs a Fuxing (Rejuvenation), the newest bullet train model developed in China. The increase will shorten travel time between Beijing South Railway Station and Tianjin Railway Station from 35 minutes to 30 minutes with no price difference in fares. "Although the time was only five minutes shorter, I was excited to see the speed of 350 kilometers per hour on the display," said passenger Zheng Yi onboard the C2002 train departing from Tianjin Wednesday. Beijing-Tianjin inter-city trains started a new train schedule Wednesday, with daily train frequency increasing from 217 one-way services to 272, according to China Railway Beijing Group.
0	Outdoor gardens built by international exhibitors have earned their places in the spotlight during the International Horticultural Expo 2019 in Beijing. Today, we're taking a closer look at the Dutch Garden. Featuring a roof garden and a rainwater collection pergola, the Dutch Garden is designed to demonstrate the Netherlands' latest concepts for a green city. The garden also gives visitors a chance to see a variety of flowers and plants, including the narcissus, lavender, hyacinths, and of course, tulips. But wait a minute -- the garden has some seats disguised as tulips as well. Can you tell them apart? Watch the video to find out.
0	As the International Horticultural Exhibition approaches, visitors are in for a green treat. Li Shumei, a Beijing resident who works for the China Youth Travel Service and has been involved with the exhibition since 2015, says she is quite confident that everything will be in good order when the exhibition opens to the public on April 29. "We've been preparing since last year, and everything is of a high standard," says Li, who mainly works on improving the visitor experience relating to seating, drinking water and toilet facilities at the exhibition venue. The exhibition will be held 74 kilometers from the center of Beijing. "It (the exhibition space) used to be an empty space," she says. But now, modern facilities, flowers and trees have taken up the space. The exhibition will be held in Beijing's Yanqing district and promises a diverse and immersive horticulture experience for the public. Li, who has been part of at least a dozen large-scale horticulture events across the country, says she is particularly impressed by the Beijing exhibition. "The pavilion layout, decorations, and garden design and originality are all beyond compare," she says. The exhibition, which will run through October, covers an area of 503 hectares. And it will have four major themes - international, China, life experience and horticultural technology. Approximately 110 countries and organizations have registered to participate. One of Li's favorite areas at the exhibition is the China Pavilion, which covers an area of 15,000 square meters. There, visitors can see China's ecological culture, the latest gardening developments and floral arrangements. Currently, more than 3,000 people from the travel agency have moved into the exhibition area for the final preparations.,Speaking about their role, Xu Xiaolei, a spokesman for China Youth Travel Service, says: "We're mostly responsible for site operations, including pavilion management, ticketing and guest reception services." And although most of the visitors are expected to buy tickets on site or book them one to three days in advance, more than 100,000 tickets have been locked up by the eager souls at the moment, says Xu. As for the overseas representation, Xu says: "The participating countries and organizations will surely bring in their best, so the audience can feast their eyes on the offerings." Meanwhile, the travel agency has developed different tour products for visitors, so they can enjoy more than 3,000 activities at the site, including music and art performance while viewing the gardening on display. Hotels will also be available in the proximity to satisfy the demands of those who want to stay longer. Separately, classes will also be available for those interested. "They can listen to masters on gardening and learn how a seed turns into a flower," says Xu, who adds that the horticulture exhibition will enable both young people and adults to appreciate the beauty of life and the importance of environmental protection. "It will surely have a positive influence on their attitudes toward life."

1	Silk ¡­ The Eternal Road, an English musical by students and teachers of the Asia-Pacific Experimental School of Beijing Normal University, premiered in Beijing on Nov 1.  The musical tells the story of a girl, named Mei, who was lured into a strange, silky world, where she is able to travel in time and visit cities on the ancient Silk Road.  During her journey, Mei encounters famous figures from history, including Marco Polo, Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368) emperor, Kublai Khan, and Zhang Qian, a diplomat and imperial envoy of the Han Dynasty (206 BC-220).  A joint production between the Asia-Pacific Experimental School of Beijing Normal University and UKCI, a theater company run by Drama UK, the musical is co-directed and written by Ian Kellgren, and Deng Wenqi. The music is composed by Patrick Dineen and the performance is choreographed by Richard Bermange.  According to Chen Guangju, the vice-president of the Asia-Pacific Experimental School of Beijing Normal University, the cooperation between the school and UKCI started three years ago, aiming at offering students theater training.  More than 100 students from the Asia-Pacific Experimental School of Beijing Normal University are part of the musical.
1	Art can help us see life's big picture and puts creativity in the frame of our lives, says Ke Lu, 41, an artist who believes the senses, and sense of wonder, we had in our youth have been dulled by the demands of modern society. "Our senses may have been eroded by information overdose and the demand for instant gratification made possible by advanced technologies", says Ke, who founded the Dashanpai Theater Art Center in 2012. The center aims to apply drama as a tool for aesthetic education to help restore a sense of creativity, especially among teenagers. It is paying dividends. On June 29, members of the center will perform The Little Prince at Tsinghua University, adapted from the French novel of the same name written by Antoine de Saint-Exupery. In the past seven years, the center, based in Wangjing in Beijing's Chaoyang district, has put on seven plays based on famous literature, and has also run themed workshops to inspire youngsters to express themselves through the medium of performance. Ke, who as a child was fascinated by painting, didn't receive any professional art training until he attended a lecture at the Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts when he was a 13-year-old middle school student. That lecture is seared into his memory.,Ke clearly recalls his first meeting with what he considered the "cool", long-haired art teacher who, in his first class, compared an artist's job to that of a divine creator. Decades later, his teacher's words still ring in his ears: "Do you know what kind of job you will be doing in the future? That is like god's job. Facing a blank piece of paper, a piece of chaotic mud, an empty room, you are god, and you have to create beautiful things in your mind." Ke says: "That moment defined my fate and belief." Encouraged by his master, Ke then explored various fields like painting, animation, film and television, until he found his true love: drama and the stage, and its "unlimited potential". In 2017, his art center was acknowledged by the faculty of Tsinghua University High School. Work carried out by the center was designated a required course among their students. Last year, the center expanded its influence to launch its plays and workshops in more high schools in several cities, including Beijing municipality as well as Zhenjiang, in East China's Jiangsu province. During the process, Ke found many educators shared similar ideas and goals. Zhao Guoqiang, principal of Zhenjiang Foreign Language International School, says: "The drama course inspires student creativity, and boosts their ability to learn. "It promotes the development of children, teachers and the cultural construction of the school." Chen Shuhua, 60, co-founder of the art center from Taiwan, thinks that children and teenagers are too obsessed with electronic gadgets. "In my childhood, I had no toys or games to play with. I just had the mountains behind my house to explore. I got the chance to feel the shape of the breeze and to hear the croak of frogs," Chen says. "It's a pity that few people today have the time to sense the beauty of the environment around them." Chen claims that the art center wants to give the five senses£­seeing, smelling, hearing, tasting and touching£­back to children, and inspire them to discover their natural creativity.,The center put on a performance in March of The Old Man and the Sea, based on Ernest Hemingway's novel of the same title, at Tsinghua University in Beijing. Before the drama began, Ke ran an interactive education experiment with the audience. He dropped a sandbag, a wooden ball and a pingpong ball on stage. He then asked the audience to imitate and compare the movements of the objects. Five audience members were invited to go onstage to perform their imitations, showing their observation and imagination. Rolling or jumping, they were all lauded by Ke and the audience applauded wildly. The play began shortly after. On the simply set stage, the sea and the sky were projected onto the background, while wooden boards, a lamp, a rope and a small statue of the Virgin Mary served as a boat. An inflated balloon represented the moon. The body language of the actors completed the theatrical effects. For instance, when pulled taut by the actors, the rope became a fishing pole and the struggle between the old fisherman and the giant marlin was presented in the form of wresting. The imagination of the audience is vital for the stage, Ke says. In part this is because of obvious limitations£­a wild raging sea cannot be transported onto the stage£­and imagination gives added value to the audience. "We don't want to present the stage as an obvious answer, we want it to collaborate with audiences' imagination and create even more possibilities of image and understanding," Ke says.,Zhang Yanhua, a teacher at Tsinghua University Primary School, brought her 9-year-old son Liu Zicheng to the show. Zicheng was deeply impressed by the creativity. Another audience member, Dorothy Jiang, a mother of two girls, says that the play can easily grab children's attention with the energetic body language of the actors coupled with the frequent audience interaction. Ke believes that to develop the ability to spot and savor beauty, people have to start by discovering themselves. Life's different stages Kong Minxing, 10, a student at the Chinese Academy of Agriculture Sciences Elementary School in Beijing, has been attending Dashanpai's aesthetic education courses for two years. Last year, he joined the cast as a part-time actor, and his performance in March playing Manolin, the little boy from The Old Man and the Sea, earned widespread acclaim. Minxing describes the art courses as "compelling". He says: "Ke let me see sounds. He tapped a bowl filled with water and I saw splashes and waves. I felt the expansion of my own body by walking on people's backs, as they created stairs for me to climb and reach for the roof." He benefited from these exercises, saying that his "ability to concentrate has been hugely improved". His father, Kong Weimeng, claims that his son used to be an introvert. "My son used to spend too much time playing video games. Learning to perform drama and interacting with the art center's crew opened a window into creativity for him," he says. "Ke uses artistic language to allow people to notice what's easily ignored in daily life. To 'see' sounds, to act, and to 'paint' with a voice£­it soothes and comforts your soul."
0	A cruise liner full of passengers from China and abroad set sail on Jan 18 from Copenhagen DFDS cruise terminal on a voyage to offer a colorful insight into Chinese culture through the theme: "Happy Chinese New Year". Aboard the cruise liner, various activities centered on Chinese Spring Festival, culture and tourism were held throughout the trip. The event was co-hosted by the Beijing Culture and Tourism Bureau, Copenhagen China Cultural Center and the Danish-United Steamship Company. Chen Dong, deputy head of the bureau, said that hopefully, the event can promote further communication and cooperation in the cultural tourism sector between the two countries, enhancing the understanding between people from both countries. Henrik Holck, vice-president of the steamship company, said he felt proud that Chinese tourists chose to spend Spring Festival, or Chinese Lunar New Year, aboard the vessel. "As foreigners, we have learnt much about the Chinese culture through the events on board the ship," he said. Denmark and China has a long history of friendship, with Copenhagen and Beijing becoming twin cities in 2012. Communication between the two cities, across a range of sectors - government, institutional, cultural and tourism - has been increasing in recent years. According to the Culture and Tourism Ministry, more than 1,500 cultural programs will take place in 396 cities across 133 countries and regions during Spring Festival. Luo Shugang, minister of culture and tourism, noted that "Happy Chinese New Year" has become the leading cultural exchange program with the widest coverage, the largest number of participants.
0	The Beijing subway will open temporary passenger trains and extend operating times to meet the needs of passengers during the Spring Festival travel rush, Beijing Youth Daily reported on Monday. Starting on Jan 21 and ending on March 1, the 2019 Spring Festival travel rush takes place 11 days earlier than the previous year. A total of 282 million passengers are expected to be transported on 16 subway lines during the 40-day Spring Festival travel rush, with an average daily passenger volume of 7.05 million, up about 3.5 percent year-on-year. Beijing Railway Station on Line 2 will start operations 20 minutes earlier. Temporary trains will be added on Line 2, Line 7 and Line 9, and the operating times of the three lines will be extended. Beijing West Railway Station on Line 9 will set up mobile ticket carts to improve the speed of ticket sales. Some 80,000 prepaid tickets will be made available to meet passenger demand. The Beijing subway also plans to roll out electronic subway tickets, enabling unlimited trips within fixed time periods. This type of ticket is designed mainly for short-term visitors to Beijing, which can reduce the number of card purchases and refunds, and reduce the number of manual ticket window operations at the same time.
0	Fifteen years after coming to China, Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the global leader in music publishing, has launched the Sony/ATV Polaris music center inside Beijing's Chaoyang Park. From June 23 to 29, more than 20 singer-songwriters and music producers from around the world gathered at the music center for the Polaris International Song Camp 2018 where they brainstormed, jammed and created original music materials. At the end of the weeklong camp, 34 original songs were born. Besides songwriting, the participants also had the opportunity to attend master classes and workshops conducted by veteran musicians from around the world, including Singaporean music producer and songwriter Lee Wei Song, Hong Kong songwriter Chan Fai-young and Beijing-based songwriter Cui Shu. "The Polaris International music center marks a brand new and exciting start of Sony/ATV music publishing in China," says Guy Henderson, president of international of Sony/ATV Music Publishing, who was in Beijing to announce the opening of the music center. "We came to China 15 years ago and through these years, we have seen the evolution of the music industry in China, from the rampant piracy of the physical market to the current exploding age of music on all kinds of digital platforms." Henderson says the music center will be a place that attracts and nurtures young music talents. "With different cultural backgrounds and understanding of music, these talents will create music together and will bring out a magical chemistry," he adds. The music center will also provide songwriters and business partners access to potential collaborations with top music technologies, professional services and cross-boundary resources, Henderson says.,Headquartered in New York, the company was set up in 1995 as a joint venture between Sony Corporation and Michael Jackson. Sony became the sole owner of the company in 2016. Norwegian record producer and songwriter Anders Froen was among the musicians who attended the music camp in Beijing. The Grammy-nominated musician, who is also known as Mood Melodies, has been in the music industry for a decade and has worked with top artists such as Jessie J and Alan Walker. "It's really cool to have one person in the room with a rock background and another who is a pop person. Something new keeps coming out from their collaboration. Different backgrounds spark ideas that never once existed," Froen says. According to Hua Shan, managing director of Sony/ATV Music Publishing China, the company first launched the song camp project in 2015 in Beijing with a goal of promoting the originality of Chinese songwriters. During that event, songwriters from different parts of the world created 22 new songs in four days. In 2016, the song camp took place in Beijing and Taipei. For 11 days, songwriters worked together for about 10 hours a day. Last year, the camp went to Tokyo and Hong Kong. In November 2017, the time when Henderson came to Beijing, he and Hua agreed to launch the music center and open it to songwriters around the world. "In this world, a hit song can come from anywhere. We've witnessed the process of the creation of new songs. The participants may be physically exhausted but they enjoy the creative process," says Hua.
0	China announced on Friday that it has lowered the bar for foreign companies to invest in Beijing's service businesses, including banking, entertainment and air transportation, to ease market access restrictions on foreign direct investment from Dec 10 to May 5. The State Council decided to allow Beijing during this period to adjust its requirements so foreign companies can invest in performance and entertainment businesses with no investment ratio being set. Supported by new policies, foreign banks and their joint ventures can apply for renminbi business when they submit the opening application to related authorities in the Chinese capital until May. They used to gain such qualification only after operating a business in China for one year. Foreign companies are also entitled to invest in the air transportation sales business. They previously could invest only in projects related to air transportation infrastructure. "Led by supply-side structural reform and the booming size of the middle class, China's ability to gain FDI is increasingly dominated by the service sector, and more profound changes are occurring in relatively developed regions," said Feng Yaoxiang, a spokesman for the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade. Feng said companies from developed countries have noticed the trend and have become more willing to invest in service businesses. China implemented a revised foreign investment catalog earlier this year, which relaxed restrictions on foreign investment in a number of industries. "The country will push for nationwide implementation of a pre-establishment national treatment system as well as a negative list, which determines industries in which foreign participation is prohibited or limited," said Ministry of Commerce spokesman Gao Feng. A negative list approach to market entry, which specifies the sectors and businesses that are off-limits to foreign investment, will be expanded nationwide in 2018. "Developing service business is vital to sustaining economic growth and encouraging foreign capital to flow into the country," said Li Guanghui, vice-president of the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation in Beijing.
1	An original dance drama will mark the 90th anniversary of the People's Liberation Army's founding.  premiered at the National Center for the Performing Arts in Beijing on Oct 10. It was choreographed by Beijing Dance Academy's president, Guo Lei, and performed by the academy's dance troupe. The plot focuses on the PLA's early history, especially in the rural revolutionary base in Jiangxi province's Jinggang Mountains that Mao Zedong established in 1927. The site is considered the "birthplace of the Chinese Red Army"£­the PLA's predecessor£­and the "cradle of the Chinese revolution". The six-chapter drama starts with a girl reading the letter left by her parents, who were Red Army soldiers. It portrays not only war scenes and soldiers' struggles but also Jiangxi's folk culture. It blends local music and dance styles with symphonic music, for instance. "It took us a year to collect local materials about Jiangxi," says Guo, who led the team to Jiangxi to visit revolutionary sites and learn more stories about the Jianggang Mountains. The choreographer adapted the rhythm of Jiangxi's tea leaf-picking operas, a folk art form, to reflect the regional style.,  He doesn't portray historical heroes but, rather, focuses on ordinary people in wartime. "These people are full of hope despite the hardships," Guo says. "They deserve contemporary audiences' applause." The dancers are young Beijing Dance Academy teachers. The work was created in partnership with Jiangxi Ji'an Vocational School's teachers and students. "After Beijing, we'll take the dance drama to Jiangxi. Jiangxi Ji'an Vocational School students will perform in it," Guo says. Guo is a Jiangxi native and returns to his hometown every year. He has long dreamed of turning the Jinggang Mountains' stories into a dance drama. "The Jinggang Mountains'stories have been adapted into various art forms, such as TV series, movies and theatrical dramas," Guo says. "Dance offers a unique vocabulary to present these tales. We hope audiences will feel the PLA's revolutionary spirit."  is part of the ongoing Spring Flowers and Autumn Fruits£­2017 Chinese Art Schools Week, an annual art festival offering a platform for major Chinese art schools' students and teachers. About 2,000 from the Beijing Dance Academy have performed in the festival since 2008.
0	Technology is making life easier for travelers in China, the country with the highest number of smartphone users. Thanks to artificial intelligence, instead of using paper tickets, tourists in Shanghai can now have their faces scanned to hop on and off sightseeing buses. The first batch of smart double-decker buses supported by Baidu Brain, the AI platform of technology giant Baidu, took to the city's streets in December, according to local media portal Shanghai Observer. When buying tickets on their mobiles, passengers' faces are scanned and verified by the phone's camera in a process that only takes about one to two seconds. Beijing home-sharing company Xiaozhu also uses facial recognition technology, and offers smart locks for a smooth check-in experience. Developed by Ant Financial, the financial technology arm of Alibaba Group, the smart locks allow people to use their faces as keys to enter houses through Xiaozhu's mobile app. This function also allows landlords to verify guests' identity and better safeguard their property. Xiaozhu is often seen as China's answer to Airbnb, the global online marketplace and hospitality service company. More than 500,000 shared houses in 650 cities and other destinations are listed on the Xiaozhu platform. Many of them are fitted with smart smoke detectors and alarms. The idea of smart accommodation is not just the preserve of fast-rising startups such as Xiaozhu. In December, a futuristic Flyzoo Hotel was unveiled by Alibaba Group in Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang province, where the company has its headquarters. Largely operated by robots, the hotel's main features include automated check-in facilities, smart facial-scan door locks and voice-controlled household appliances. Guests can buy the furniture and many other items used in the hotel by taking photos through a designated app. Wang Liantao, cofounder and chief operating officer of Xiaozhu, said, "The idea of a sharing economy is now widely accepted across the world, and China takes the leading position." He said the country's tech-savvy consumers, rapid economic development and ongoing consumption upgrades are part of the reasons for this growth. While 66 percent of Chinese tourists book most of their trips on mobile devices, only 23 percent of Japanese travelers do so, according to a survey in 2017 by international travel technology service provider Amadeus. The Chinese proportion was the highest among the 14 markets covered. Many foreign tourists in China are now booking everything online, as this offers greater convenience. Online travel agency Ctrip provides services in 12 languages through its international site Trip.com, and the company offers travelers the option to either join tour groups, or to book services and products individually. Sun Bowen, Ctrip's general manager of inbound tourism destination marketing, said, "By using big data analysis to get the user portrait of each country, we can come up with promotions and marketing strategies in a more targeted way." In addition to relying on data from its own platform, Ctrip partners with international social media platforms and search engines such as Facebook, Twitter and Google for better analysis. Although they may not be that popular with foreign travelers yet, portable translation devices are now must-have companions for an increasing number of Chinese tourists, as they can help them overcome language barriers whey they are abroad. During last year's Nov 11 Singles Day shopping festival, the JoneR Pro, priced at 2,999 yuan ($443), ranked second in the pocket translator category on e-commerce platform JD.com and Alibaba's online marketplace Tmall. Developed by Beijing Babel Technology Co in collaboration with Tsinghua University, the JoneR Pro supports two-way voice translation of 53 languages. Similar in size to a smartphone, it can translate text from photos and provide Wi-Fi access and an audio guide service for more than 1,200 popular travel destinations in 50-plus countries. AI is one of the JoneR Pro's key technologies, said Xie Yanshun, marketing director of Beijing Babel Technology. "People don't always talk in full sentences using correct grammar, but we can understand each other because we can think based on common sense. For translators, they need to figure this out independently with the help of AI," Xie said. Li Yunpeng, director of the Tourism Internet Plus Institute at Capital University of Economics and Business in Beijing, said various technologies have been used in the tourism industry to tackle specific problems for decades. But the link to tourists in each scenario should be factored in properly so that users can tap the full potential. "Many of the applications are still focused on the user side and haven't been integrated into each business. For example, people may be able to book visa applications with a travel agency on WeChat, but they still need to hand in the documents required in person or by mail," Li said. He thinks companies should place more emphasis on the appropriate use of technology in order to reduce operating costs and improve efficiency. In turn, this will help them to upgrade their business processes. Li said commercialization of the fifth generation, or 5G, mobile communications technology - targeted by the central government for next year - will further stimulate the growth of tourism technology. For example, technologies such as augmented reality and virtual reality can be expanded to more applications, from booking and guide services to virtual tourism. Technologies such as AI, big data, the internet of things and blockchain will all play important roles in pushing the industry forward, according to Li. He said tourism, although often seen as a traditional industry, has huge potential in integrating with various other businesses, and will be further modernized with the help of different technologies, including smart architecture. "Today's consumers are very accustomed to using their mobile phones or other new technologies to solve problems. Under these circumstances, tourism companies and those who want to provide tourism-related services have to adapt to these changes," Li said. Xie, from Beijing Babel Technology, said location-based services will be added to the JoneR Pro translator later this year through a free upgrade pack. This will allow the devices to automatically notify users of audio guide material as they visit a tourist attraction, or give recommendations for a specific restaurant. "We hope that in the future the JoneR Pro will not only be the travel companion of outbound tourists, but also accompany foreign tourists when they visit China and elsewhere," Xie said. The translators can be bought or rented on major Chinese e-commerce platforms, online travel service providers, and airports in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, Guangdong province.
0	The thriving China-Chilean economic and trade cooperation will be further bolstered by the upcoming China International Import Expo, officials and company executives of the two countries said at a Chile Week seminar in Beijing on Nov 1. Chile Week aims to project the participation of Chile in the Belt and Road Initiative in the technological and financial fields, and seeks to attract innovative investments in these areas. This year's Chile Week was scheduled in November, instead of previous years' August or September, to coincide with the expo, to be held in Shanghai starting Nov 5. Wang Shouwen, vice-minister of commerce of China, regarded the China-Chile relationship as a good example of cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. Chile was the first Latin American country to sign a free trade agreement with China, and the bilateral trade volume between the two countries reached $35.4 billion last year, four times its size than when the agreement was signed. As China's third-largest trading partner in Latin America, Chile's food and beverages such as blueberries and wine are welcomed happily in China. Chile is the second largest fruit exporter to China, and the third largest wine exporter to China, the minister said. The two countries upgraded their free trade agreement on Nov 11 last year, which will go into effect on Jan 1, 2019. According to the minister, the two countries will enhance operations under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative, and conduct cooperation in multiple fields such as agriculture, infrastructure and tourism. The China International Import Expo, the first of its kind in China, will provide further opportunities for overseas commodities and services, the minister added.,According to Chilean Ambassador Luis Schmidt, the country is willing to conduct cooperation with China under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative, and also mentioned the two parties will sign a memorandum of understanding on the Belt and Road Initiative on Friday. The CIIE is a key component of multilateral relations, the ambassador added. Chile will showcase its products and export services at the country pavilion, and display high-quality, healthy food at the food pavilion. 15 Chilean enterprises and five industries, namely wine, fruit, pork, avocado and olive oil, will be showcased at the expo. According to Steven Fang, CEO of EAE Mall, China Eastern Airlines, hundreds of flights are bringing cherries from Chile to China directly. The first batch of fresh king crabs will be transported from Chile to China next week, he added. Fang also noted Chile salmon, cherries and king crabs are being introduced to all of China, not only metropolitan areas like Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. Daniel Meng, head of fresh global sourcing for Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com, said Chilean food products are welcomed at e-commerce stores and he is looking forward to the country's huge pavilion at CIIE.
1	Kumar Khadka is the center of attention on a tour of some of the ancient Silk Road sites in late August. His thick curly hair and beard set the 28-year-old from Nepal apart from his peers from countries like Kazakhstan, Laos and Vietnam, as well as members of a think tank from Peking University. All of them joined the trip, a part of the ancient Silk Road tour initiated by the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, which aims to promote trade and cultural exchanges. The tour kicked off in Beijing in late August and will end on Sept 29, after covering significant sites in seven countries£­China, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Poland, the Czech Republic, France and the Netherlands. "People tease me and say that I look a lot like Karl Marx," says Khadka, who enjoyed the distinctive elements of Chinese culture during the six-day road trip from Beijing to Dunhuang, in the northwestern Gansu province. He enjoyed listening to the horse-head fiddle, and admired the hide carvings and ethnic dancing during his stay in Ordos, Inner Mongolia autonomous region. "I'd heard of Inner Mongolia before, but it's amazing to experience the culture there," he says. "The hide carving was exquisite and dancing with local Mongolians was great fun," says Khadka, who is currently studying Chinese philosophy in Beijing. The Mogao Grottoes in Gansu province, the art performance and the lecture on the ancient history of Dunhuang also impressed him. "The tour helped me discover more about China," says Khadka. "Earlier, I thought Inner Mongolia was all desert and yurts, but there are so many green spaces and modern buildings there." Curiosity about China planted the desire in him to learn Mandarin back in 2010. "Many Nepalese didn't know China so well back then, and I was intrigued by this big neighbor when I saw it on the map," says Khadka. He developed a working knowledge of Chinese after spending three years studying it at the Tribhuvan University in Kirtipur, Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal. And then, an opportunity to study Mandarin in China came his way. He applied for a two-year master's program of teaching Chinese to speakers of other languages at the Beijing Language and Culture University via the Confucius Institute, and was accepted in 2013 with a full scholarship. "This was the only way for me to fully learn Chinese history and culture," he says. "Then I can maybe go back and teach what I've learned to people at home." The language program helped him master Chinese after he completed it in June 2015. Khadka, who has passed the HSK 6£­the highest level Chinese language test designed for non-native speakers£­now speaks Mandarin fluently. After finishing the master's program, he decided to take a break and use his language skills to experience Chinese culture. So, Khadka chose to spend some time in the Xishuangbanna Dai autonomous prefecture of southwestern Yunnan province.,There, he stayed with tea-growing farmers and experienced every part of tea production, from picking and processing, to storage, all of which were interesting in Khadka's eyes. The traditional tea drinking ritual also impressed him. "To me, drinking tea is a way of enjoying life," he says. Later, to better understand Chinese thinking and culture, he applied to study Chinese philosophy at Beijing Normal University in September 2016. "I believe philosophy can give me an insight into Chinese thinking and how China became what it is today," Khadka says. Khadka is one of the many Nepalese students who have benefited from the increasingly frequent exchanges between China and Nepal. More than 6,400 Nepalese students have studied in China as of 2017. And Khadka alone knows 60 to 70 of his compatriots learning Mandarin in China at the moment. "There are even more of us doing medicine and engineering in Beijing," he says. Khadka, the vice-chairman of the Beijing-based Nepal Chinese Language Teachers Association, which aims to boost bilateral exchanges, says the association has arranged for Nepalese students to study in China and for Chinese learning institutes to host academic events in Nepal. Separately, the association will host an Asian natural philosophy meeting in Lunbini, Nepal, in November, in conjunction with a university in Lunbini and Beijing Normal University. "We want to help Nepalese better understand opportunities in China, and the Chinese faculty to understand Nepal's academic environment and resources," he says.
0	They swayed and stretched after receiving their instruction£­several students moving their bodies to express the concept of "space." That was how Tang Yi, a dance teacher at Beijing Normal University, demonstrated to the audience how to give a class on Laban's theory, a practical theory of dance, at the opening ceremony of the Asia-Pacific International Dance Education Conference. Held in Beijing from Oct 19 to 21, many experts from home and abroad took part in the conference to discuss how to cultivate dance talent, especially in a comprehensive university environment. BNU is widely regarded as a specialized university to train teachers, but it is also a comprehensive university, according to Xiao Xiangrong, the head of dance department at the university. That is especially true in terms of the university's dance department in contrast to a specialized art university like a conservatory or dance academy. In his opinion, specialized art schools focus on cultivating specific talents. For example, students who graduate from a dance academy usually strive to be professional dancers, but students who graduate from BNU's dance department may end up working in a number of dancing-related jobs, such as choreography, dance and teaching. A report on Chinese internet users' ability to appreciate beauty in dance, jointly prepared by BNU's dance department and the school of journalism and communication, was also released at the event. Xiao said that some of the results are surprising. First of all, Chinese internet users have strong aspiration for beauty, which, in Xiao's words, "may coincide with the saying 'It is natural that human beings all take a fancy to beauty'." However, only a few people are able to derive the meaning of beauty from watching a dance performance. This, according to Zhang Yue, a student of BNU who participated in writing the report, "may indicate that many people still believe dance is only for the minority". "However, we hope to bring dance to more people, to show them that everyone can enjoy it," she added. The report also notes that some Chinese netizens are more familiar with Latin dance, hip-hop and ballet, but they seldom pay attention to traditional Chinese dance. "Despite learning and advancing our experience of other countries, we should still remember our own culture," said Xiao. It was also found that it is primary school and university students that participate the most in dance activities, while middle and high school students participate the least. "It indicates that our dance education is utilitarian to some extent. In middle and high schools, dance has to give way to 'major' subjects like Chinese, maths and English," said Xiao. In terms of personal experiences related to dance, researchers were surprised to find the influence of square dancing. "Square dancing, according to the report, can really enhance peoples' ability to appreciate beauty," said Xiao. "Many experts look down on square dancing, but since it does exert influence on so many people, we need to guide it, to make the dancers really know about aesthetic culture in dance." Finally, the more influential media to spread dance right now are short-video apps like Douyin and Kuaishou. "Such short videos cannot fully express the beauty of dance. For us dance educators, we want to discuss how to take advantage of such tools and lead people to theaters, which is a real world of dance (and the best place to appreciate its beauty)," said Xiao. Researchers distributed about 50,000 questionnaires online and analyzed around 3,000 effective responses. Those who answered the questions were a good cross-section of society, from both urban and rural backgrounds and from different all age groups. Dance education for primary schools, middle schools, universities, training organizations and even the physically challenged were also among the topics discussed during the conference. Foreign experts also participated, sharing their ideas. Angela Carol Perry, an Australian dance teacher, introduced the curriculum from her country that asks students to learn the arts. They are required to learn music, drama, dance, media arts and visual arts from the ages of 5 to 13. After 13, they can select one or more art subjects to specialize in. Yoon Mira, one of the leading figures of new dance in the Republic of Korea, gave a lecture on Dalgubul dance, a Korean re-creation of traditional dance, which premiered in 1999. "Our shared aspiration here today is to make dance walk into more people's hearts, become a key to open their minds, and a part of their lifestyle," guest speaker Chen Xiaoli, a deputy division director of Beijing Municipal Education Commission, said at the event.
0	Chinese smart glasses producer Beijing LLVision Technology Co Ltd and the Chinese Academy of Sciences announced on Wednesday the launch of a joint laboratory focused on vision technology, to accelerate the commercialization of facial recognition. The Institute of Automation of the CAS will join the lab to promote the research and development of technologies related to intelligent devices, while LLVision will drive the application and use of the tech. "Through such collaboration, we aim to put scientific achievements into commercial use to create more value," said Xu Changsheng, chief researcher with the institute. "Both parties will supplement each other in developing first perspective or vision information computing technologies," he added. LLVision, known as the Chinese version of "Google Glass", is a company that produces intelligent wearable glasses. The glasses, according to the company, are able to identify faces from a database of 10,000 in 100 milliseconds. At present, its products and technologies have been used in a wide range of segments including the industrial, medical and security fields. Earlier this year, police from Zhengzhou, Henan province used the company's wearable devices to scan unusual situations and detect lawbreaking travelers. With the help of the device, a total of seven people connected to criminal cases as well as another 26 travelers who were using false IDs were caught, the company said. Wu Fei, founder of LLVision, noted the company has also cooperated with major tech companies including Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and accumulated a large number of data, which in turn will improve the efficiency of intelligent glasses.
0	The long history of Chinese culture, including its development, spread and influence, is reflected in Chinese characters. On the one hand, Chinese characters are symbols that carry and spread Chinese stories and philosophies. On the other hand, they contain the aesthetic elements of the Chinese style. Chinese scholar Yu Dan, author of a best-selling book on Confucianism in China and dean of the Beijing Institute of Culture Innovation and Communication, invested a lot of time and effort in promoting traditional Chinese culture to the world. In order to arouse global interest in Chinese characters, Yu initiated ¡°The Beauty of Chinese Characters¡± Global Youth Design Contest in 2015. The first session was launched at UNESCO headquarters in Paris, attracting 1,250 entries from 16 countries and regions around the world. This September, the finalists for the second session of the contest were announced in Beijing. Yu shares with China Daily Website her understanding of the beauty of Chinese characters, her mission with this contest that combines Chinese characters and design, and different understanding of Chinese characters from foreign designers¡¯ perspectives.

1	Two months from summer vacation, parents are already making plans for their children. Dozens of parents and children guests have since April been visiting Beijing brick-and-mortar shops owned by domestic online travel agency Ctrip, the agency reports. "The online views of our summer vacation study tour products have increased by 120 percent in April compared with the previous month," said Zhang Jie, Ctrip's study tour general manager. Zhang expects the number of young study travelers to grow by more than 50 percent compared with last year. The US, the UK, Austria, Japan and Canada are among the most popular foreign destinations for study tours. Beijing, northwestern Gansu province's Dunhuang, Shanghai, western Shaanxi province's Xi'an and eastern Jiangsu province's Nanjing topped the domestic destination list. Wang Chunxia has arranged study tours for her son since 2015. "We've been to deserts, grasslands, and (sections of) the Silk Road over the years," Wang said. Wang has booked a two-week trip to Australia and a two-week trip to the US in August for her son, who is in the fifth grade. "He will be sitting in on local classes and studying with local children there," Wang said. Although the trips will cost her roughly 70,000 yuan, Wang said it's money well spent. "He will learn things while having fun in those foreign lands, which will open his eyes and enable him to make new friends," she says. Wang said her son now better understands different cultures and is more confident. "I will keep sending him on these trips to see more places and know their culture and history," Wang said.
0	Beijing and neighboring areas, including Tianjin and Hebei province, are expected to experience heavy rainstorms starting on Thursday.  Incoming storms have already resulted in the cancellation of more than 200 flights in the capital on Wednesday.  Thunderstorms were expected to hit the capital on Wednesday night, with moderate rainfall, reaching a peak on Thursday, with torrential rains sweeping the capital, Tianjin and Hebei, said Guo Jinlan, chief forecaster of the Beijing Meteorological Center.  The heavy rain is expected to last in the region until Saturday, with precipitation reaching 100 to 150 millimeters a day in some regions, which could be good for thirsty soil, she said.  The coming round of torrential rain is mainly the result of a cold front moving in from Mongolia, which could bring strong and steady rain, Sun Jun, chief forecaster at the Central Meteorological Center, said on Wednesday.  Similar heavy rains and gusty winds have caused injuries and traffic chaos in Beijing.  The capital's weather authority has issued a yellow rain alert, the third-highest level in the four-tiered system.  The thunderstorm, gusts and torrential rains for the coming days will affect traffic, especially flights.  As of 6 pm on Wednesday, 280 flights in and out of Beijing Capital International Airport have been canceled, according to the North China Regional Administration of the Civil Aviation Administration of China.  Based on the weather forecasts, it was estimated that traffic capacity in the airport would be reduced by 30 percent from 4 pm to 11 pm on Wednesday, and only allow 30 arrivals per hour, airport authorities said.  After 11 pm, air traffic capacity will be further reduced, with only 20 arrivals allowed to land per hour, the airport added.  The airport said it is prepared to coordinate the flights and serve tourists.  Parts of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei province may encounter torrential rains on Thursday, but "it will not reach the highest alert level as rumors predicted," said Fang Chong, a forecaster at the central weather center. But she reminded the public to take preventive measures, and be alert for rain-triggered floods and landslides.
0	Total soybean exports from the United States to China would decline by at least 20 percent for the 2017-18 marketing year, compared to a historic record of 36 million metric tons in the last marketing year, if the trade dispute between China and US cannot be solved in a timely manner. Zhang Xiaoping, country director for China at the US Soybean Export Council, said current trade tensions have already pushed Chinese importers to turn elsewhere for soybean supplies, although US soybeans are competitive in both price and quality. "US farmers believe the right strategy to solve trade imbalances should be to further expand trade instead of restrictive measures such as punitive tariffs. So they have been making an effort to support all policies aimed at expanding trade," he said. As the US is expected to increase its sales of soybean and soy products to other markets, total US soybean exports for this year would decrease only by 5 percent, according to the USSEC. "Because soybean trade between China and the US has been beneficial to Chinese crushers, feed millers, animal producers and US farmers, any trade restrictions will damage the industries in both countries. We don't think it reasonable or worthwhile for any policies to hurt ones' own interests," Zhang said. He added soybean trade between the two countries will be further expanded in the long run, and expanding soy trade can effectively help solve the trade imbalance issue in the short term. "We hope the two countries will realize the importance of soybean trade to both economies and find the solution to the current trade dispute." China has other options to seek new soybean sellers from other markets such as Brazil and Argentina, although the US has some advantages when it comes to price and sophisticated distribution systems for delivery. "US soybeans are of decent quality in terms of digestible amino acids for better animal feed, which makes the US a competitive supplier of soybeans," said Li Hanping, a professor at Shenyang Agricultural University in Liaoning province. Soybeans are grown in 29 states in the US, where about 55 percent of its soybean product is exported. Chinese farmers currently plant non-genetically modified varieties, and their per-hectare production is around half that of the genetically modified ones grown in the US, Brazil and Argentina. It is difficult to increase China's soybean output within a short period, because farmers in the Northeast cannot get more land or convert land grown for other yields such as corn and rice. "With rising farming equipment prices and limited arable land, the cost of raising domestic output is fairly high," said Ding Lixin, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences in Beijing.

1	BEIJING - Yuan Ye, a father in Beijing, is proud that his seven-year-old son built and programmed a robotic dog as a Children's Day gift for himself. Through component assembling and coding, the boy made the robot bark, nod its head and wag its tail like a real dog, an achievement that he sees as truly special for this year's children's day. It was built in a child coding course he attended in Beijing. In China, computer coding has become popular as an after-school training course favored by parents who want to pave the way for their children's bright futures. The younger Yuan has been enrolled in the programming class for three years. "He is interested in a lot of things, but programming is his favorite. So far it is the longest habit of his," the father said. Computer coding becomes increasingly popular around the world, as artificial intelligence (AI) is shaping people's everyday life with applications in numerous sectors, from smartphones to self-driving cars. The UK government overhauled computing teaching method by adding mandatory programming courses for children in 2014. Computer programming is expected to become a mandatory subject in Japan's elementary schools in 2020. Since 2015, the Chinese government has published guidelines encouraging schools to experiment with STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Mathematics) education, including coding. An AI development plan issued by China's State Council in 2017 required adding courses in coding in elementary and secondary education system, and encourages institutions and companies to design software and other related games. "After 3 years of training, my son can grasp basic physics and computer coding concepts. It brings up qualities in logic and trains him in making objects," Yuan said. "The purpose is not to prepare him to be a professional programmer, but to develop his creativity and problem-solving skills." Roughly 200 institutions and companies in China offer online or offline coding training for children, according to researchers familiar with the industry. Shenzhen-based Codemao is an education company that provides online graphical programming courses for students aged seven to 16. It also provides an online platform where children can design via programming and display their own work, including games and animation. It has over 10 million online users and its services are available on both smartphones and PCs, the company said. Booming demand has lured rich capital into the market. In 2017, 30 child coding projects were established in China. The value of a single investment to fund the project kept rising, market researchers said. The programming education is promising in terms of helping children better understand the information and intelligence industry, however, the intervention of capital and undue anxiety of parents might impede the healthy development of the industry. Yao Huanan resigned his job to start a children programming education enterprise last year. "I was trying to find a coding class for my nine-year-old daughter, but the quality of the classes was not satisfactory, " he said. "These private institutions focus too much on profit, rather than on the quality of the courses," he said. "Most of the programming education is happening outside schools in private institutions. They should be made available in schools as well," said Xiong Bingqi, vice president of 21st Century Education Research Institute, a leading educational think-tank in China. Educational authorities shall outline the degree of programming proficiency needed for children so that parents, teachers and children can know better what should be done, he said. Yuan Ye's son is making steady progress in his out-of-school class. "I really like programming robots," the boy said. "My teacher will show us how to make a robot cat. It can meow when we touch her head."
0	Foreign companies will be allowed to set up performance venues in designated areas of Beijing's cultural and entertainment hubs, with no restriction on the proportion of foreign investments, according to a State Council notice released Friday. Foreign companies will also be allowed to invest in aviation transport agencies, the notice said. In June, the State Council approved a plan to further open up Beijing's service sector. Beijing was allowed to relax the access threshold on qualifications, investment ratio and business scales for foreign companies in key areas such as technological, cultural, educational and financial services, business and tourism services and health care.
0	Beijing's first bikeway, which connects Huilongguan in Changping district and Shangdi in Haidian district for cyclists, has finished the colored pavement and is about to open this week. The bicycle-only road has a maximum speed of no more than 15 kilometers per hour and is forbidden to entry by pedestrians, electric bicycles and other vehicles, according to traffic rules on the bikeway released by the Beijing Municipal Commission of Transport. Cyclists should travel on the right and be aware that riding against the traffic and parking are not allowed on the bikeway. In the event of a bicycle breakdown, cyclists should wheel their bikes to the nearest exit and leave the bikeway, keeping to the right side of the road, said the rules. There are eight entrances and exits on the 6.5-km bikeway and six of them are equipped with assistive mobility devices for bicycles. To better meet the needs of commuters, a reversible lane has been introduced on the bikeway, and cyclists should ride in the direction shown on the signs. Some 11,600 commuters travel between Huilongguan and Shangdi daily, and the opening of the reversible lane is expected to provide convenience to them during rush hours.
0	High-level environmental protection inspectors have filed 134 cases against companies in North China's Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region over air pollution as part of an ongoing campaign to catch rule-breaking businesses. About 200 supervision teams have been sent to the region, with the focus on steel, coal-fired power plants and construction industries, according to Li Ganjie, the minister of ecology and environment. "The campaign is a long-term mechanism rather than a short-term movement, which aims at helping local governments solve their pollution problems and improve the environment," he said on Sunday. The ministry said on Sunday that teams had checked 1,254 companies in Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei province, as well as surrounding areas, and discovered three companies that failed to meet air pollution standards. In Hebei, North China's Shanxi province and Central China's Henan province and Tianjin, a total of 13 companies failed to meet the anti-air pollution installation standards, and 11 industrial companies' anti-air pollution facilities were not in working condition. The ministry also announced one excessive pollutants discharge case in Shijiazhuang, Hebei province, and 35 construction fugitive dust emissions in Hebei and Shanxi. The ministry has handed over all the cases to local governments, which will deal with the involved companies and individuals according to laws and regulations. The ministry started the environmental protection campaign to strengthen the supervision against illegal pollution on June 11. It focuses on areas that include the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, the Fenhe-Weihe plain in North China and the Yangtze River Delta region. The number of days in a year with good air quality in Hebei, Shanxi and Henan, and East China's Shandong province and Tianjin is less than 60 percent, the ministry said. The campaign will last till April 28. During the campaign period, the ministry will examine several times the cities involved and help local governments improve their industrial, energy and transportation structures and land use. The ministry gained experience in this during an environmental protection campaign in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region between 2017 to 2018. It will make full use of that experience in the enlarged area for the new campaign this year to 2019.
0	It wasn't long after I first set foot in China that I was introduced to the ephemeral delights of Beijing's hutong, circa 2016.  Having had no previous experience of these age-old alleyways, I knew not what to expect. Would they be like the "snickelways" of York, England, which I had explored in my youth, or something more akin to the winding passageways of Manama's old souk, in my former home of Bahrain?  Turns out it was neither. They were unique and I was enchanted - not only by the architecture, but also by the vibrancy of the assorted bars, restaurants, galleries and boutiques that called these lawless lanes their home.  And lawless they were, or so I was to learn later, when a program of renovations and crackdowns on illegal structures began in earnest this year.      But I didn't know that at the time. Coming to the city with fresh eyes, and only some small knowledge of its history, I simply assumed this was the way the hutong had always been.  Well, maybe not always-I had supposed those establishments owned or run by foreigners were newer additions. The nature of the business being conducted must surely have changed over time, too. But nothing that my naive gaze fell upon lead me to believe that this part of the city's heart had, at least in recent memory, been anything but the diverse mishmash of culture and merriment that was laid out before me.  I realize now I did myself a disservice in those early days in this ancient city by not exploring more of what the hutong had to offer and better patronizing those places I had found and begun to love.  For it turned out that a profound change was on the horizon, one that - if the city's English-language lifestyle magazines are to be believed - was met with no small amount of shock and sorrow, especially among the expatriate community.  I, too, felt a kind of despondency, as I watched many of my favorite new haunts torn down or bricked up. Some were shuttered, others relocated, and a few have managed to carry on, for now.  Change, of course, is inevitable. Like living entities, all cities change. No big city is immune to it, and Beijing is bigger than most.  What makes this change different, though, is that it isn't really a change at all. It's more of a reversion. As an unnamed official was quoted as saying in May, the renovations are meant to "recover the original appearance of the hutong", described as "an integral part of the capital's traditional culture".  As a foreigner in a foreign land, I feel I'm in no position to pass comment. I can merely bear witness to the renovations' effects.  And though I was saddened by their passing, I'm just glad I experienced the magic of those haphazard hutong hangouts, before they were lost to time.

1	BEIJING - Bigyan Neupane is busy completing experiments and working on his thesis so that he can graduate this summer. The Nepalese international student is currently studying for a PhD at Northwest Institute of Eco-Environment and Resources under the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Thanks to a scholarship from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Neupane has been able to focus on his research and studies in China without financial worries. Neupane is part of a growing trend. In recent years, more students from the Belt and Road (B&R) countries are coming to China to undertake higher education. According to a report published by the Center for China and Globalization (CCG), a major Chinese think tank, China had about 443,000 foreign students in 2016, and 207,746 of them were from the B&R countries. Of the top 15 source countries, 10 were along the B&R routes, said the CCG report. Back in 2004, China had only 24,896 foreign students from the B&R countries. The changes were made possible by China's increasing efforts to strengthen ties with the B&R countries, especially in the field of education. China has set up a series of scholarship programs for international students to study at its universities. The Chinese Government Scholarships program, run by the China Scholarship Council, covers a total of 289 universities. Since it's launch, more than 60 percent of applicants have come from the B&R countries. In 2016, the Beijing municipal government set up a scholarship program for international students from the B&R countries to study in the city. A total of 298 students were offered scholarships by 23 Beijing-based universities that year. Provincial-level regions such as Gansu, Hubei and Chongqing are also setting up similar programs. In July 2016, the Ministry of Education issued a set of guidelines to promote education cooperation with the B&R countries. The aim, according to the ministry statement, was to "promote people-to-people connectivity, cultivate talent for the Belt and Road Initiative, and to achieve shared development." The guideline also called on local governments and social organizations to step up efforts. "Many students from my country have come to China to study in recent years," said Egidio da Costa from East Timor. Da Costa completed his bachelor's degree at the Beijing University of Chemical Technology (BUCT) in 2015. He went on to study for a master's degree at Beijing-based University of International Business and Economics. After graduation, da Costa went back to work in East Timor, but his bond with China has continued. He regularly shares news about China and Chinese songs on social network platforms. His WeChat ID is still his Chinese name followed by his student number from BUCT. In November 2017, da Costa returned to Beijing to attend the First Silk Road NGO Cooperation Network Forum, an event aimed at enhancing exchanges and cooperation among people of the Silk Road countries and facilitating people-to-people connectivity. In March 2017, the State Administration of Foreign Expert Affairs, together with three Chinese ministries, issued a circular on establishing a nationwide system to grant easier approval for foreigners to work in China. "The policy is a good news for international students studying in China," said Neupane. "I'm looking forward to working here." As for da Costa, he is planning to return to China to study for a PhD next year. He said he wants to study business and then teach at his university after graduating. "China is my second home. I'm eager to return," he said.

This is the first direct flight ever launched by Dublin Airport to connect the Irish capital with the Chinese capital. Prior to the departure of the flight, a brief ceremony was held at Terminal One of Dublin Airport, which involved speeches from officials of Dublin Airport, Hainan Airlines and the Chinese embassy in Ireland. A cake-cutting and a ribbon-cutting were also held at the ceremony. Commenting on the launch of Tuesday's maiden flight from Dublin to Beijing, Dublin Airport Managing Director Vincent Harrison said that it was a historic day for the airport. "Trade between Ireland and China is hugely important for our economy," said Harrison, adding that the new direct route will greatly facilitate Irish firms and exporters with operations and clients in China as well as Chinese financial services and technology companies investing in Ireland. According to Harrison, Ireland is also home to more than 5,000 Chinese students attending Irish educational institutions and each year there are estimated 30,000 people travelling between Dublin and Beijing. He said the launch of the direct Dublin-Beijing flight route will make travellers between Ireland and China much easier. The direct Dublin-Beijing flight service is operated by Hainan Airlines on a four-days-a-week basis with non-stop flights between Dublin and Beijing as well as flights with a stopover in Britain's city of Edinburgh. Hainan Airlines is a major airline in China with a fleet size of over 400 planes which offer nearly 1,800 flight routes to over 220 destinations around the world. Dublin Airport is the largest airport in Ireland which annually handles about 85 percent of the total flight passengers in the country. Earlier on June 2, a Hong Kong-based airline Cathay Pacific also opened its first direct flight service between Hong Kong and Dublin. With the opening of these two direct flight routes, the economic and people-to-people exchanges between China and Ireland will surely be strengthened, said an official from the Chinese embassy in Ireland.
0	The posthumous homages paid to legendary Hollywood actress and UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, Audrey Hepburn, never cease. However, a new exhibition, by Shanghai Calanstar Culture Co. Ltd, manages to be a unique tribute. The two-month exhibition, entitled "Beyond Time" is a creative celebration of Hepburn's elegance and nobleness, and is now on display in Beijing. The exhibition, spread over two-stories, is filled with memorabilia and imaginative art. The "time-tunnel" corridor, decorated by mirrors, tinfoil hangings and suspended postcards of Hepburn, is a mesmerizing tribute to both her Hollywood heyday and later humanitarian work. Another piece, consisting of three portraits of the late actress, each made from a single 1,000-meter-long thread are impressive works of technical majesty. The exhibition also features several replicas, including the vespa scooter she rode while starring in "Roman Holiday" and her black sleeveless dress from "Breakfast at Tiffany's". These replicas serve to remind us of the iconic movies that continue to fuel her eternal popularity. "Her beauty has been appreciated by both the western and eastern audiences, and more importantly, she was a nice and good-hearted person," said Sun Wen, the exhibition's liaison from Shanghai Calanstar Culture Co. Ltd. Rising to prominence with a starring role in "Roman Holiday" alongside Gregory Peck in 1953, Hepburn won immense popularity from her classic films and iconic fashionable styles. However, her most defining work was perhaps in her role as a humanitarian. In 1989, she was appointed to be UNICEF's Goodwill Ambassador, and in the following years, she paid many visits to underdeveloped countries, including, Ethiopia, Guatemala and Bangladesh, where she helped children suffering from starvation and women afflicted by disease, poverty and severe gender inequality. "Since acting had never been her favorite career choice, she concentrated more on family life and philanthropy in her later years," Sun noted. The exhibition also showcases a wall of Hepburn's famous remarks, such as, "I believe in being strong when everything seems to be going wrong¡­I believe that tomorrow is another day and I believe in miracles." "I know her through her foreign films, but nevertheless I can also appreciate her beauty beyond the screen," said Sun Tingting, who visited the exhibition. 10:00 am to 10:00pm Dec 12, 2018 to Feb 20, 2019 1st Floor, Chaoyang Joy City No.101 North Chaoyang Road, Chaoyang district, Beijing
1	HONG KONG -- "I didn't think of studying in the Chinese mainland until I went on a trip to Beijing last November," Mejorada Nicole Katelyn Remeticado, a Filipino student in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), told Xinhua her latest plan for the future. Remeticado is a student from Caritas Tuen Mun Marden Foundation Secondary School in the New Territories of Hong Kong, a local high school with a total of some 300 students from over 15 countries and regions. Unlike those famous local schools in Hong Kong, Marden Foundation Secondary School has not gained much attention from the society until recent years when the Belt and Road has become one of the buzzwords following its announcement in 2013. The Belt and Road Initiative refers to the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, aiming at building a trade and infrastructure network connecting Asia with Europe, Africa and beyond through the ancient trade routes of the Silk Road. Promoting cultural and people-to-people exchanges between China and other countries and regions participating in the Belt and Road cooperation is one of the five areas of connectivity proposed in the initiative. The school capitalizes on their "Belt and Road population" to enhance students' knowledge about the initiative and present young people with education opportunities in the mainland. According to Chu Yuen Yee, the assistant principal of the school, a large number of their students came from Belt and Road countries and regions, including Nepal, Pakistan, India, Yemen, Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines. During a trip to Beijing organized by her school in November last year, Remeticado visited the Beijing Foreign Studies University, where she met with a couple of alumni from Marden Foundation. "They shared with me their college life in Beijing which I found impressive," the teenager said. "I would like to do my tertiary education outside Hong Kong, and the mainland is definitely one of my choices." Like many of her fellow schoolmates, Remeticado learnt about the Belt and Road Initiative during Liberal Studies class, a core subject in Hong Kong high-school education. "It's initiated by China with the aim to connect different countries together," she said. Lai Man Fat, Remeticado's Liberal Studies teacher, said that by talking about culture, they help students to build the concept of what the initiative is all about. "We encouraged our students to start from their own culture in particular," which, Lai said, is an easier and more interesting way for young people to understand a national-level policy. The school has set up a Belt and Road exhibition room on the campus, showcasing national costumes, currencies and utensils from various countries and regions. They even extended the education about Belt and Road outside classroom, by organizing visits to the mainland, for instance. Besides, they have built collaborations with a number of universities on the mainland, all for creating a better path for students' future. "Hong Kong is not a market big enough for students from Belt and Road countries and regions to develop their career," Yuen Kwok Ming, principal of the school, said. "The mainland is a huge market and has close ties with different countries in business and economics, allowing young people to make the best of their talent."
0	HELSINKI - Each year, two large scale firework shows are held in Helsinki, the capital of Finland. One is on New Year's Eve, the other on the Chinese Lunar New Year's Eve. The Spring Festival celebrated in Finland, highlighted by the Helsinki Temple Fair, adds lively colors, cheerful laughter and harmonious atmosphere to this Nordic country when the long, dark winter prevails. The annual event becomes now part of the Happy Spring Festival, a universal celebration for Chinese Lunar New Year across the globe. However, the Helsinki Temple Fair has its own course. It was created in 2007 following an agreement reached between Helsinki and Beijing, and has ever since been gaining popularity among local citizens around Helsinki.,The 12th edition of Helsinki Temple Fair kicked off on Thursday evening as the drum beat of the dragon and lion dance gathered hundreds of people downtown. The dragon pilots were a group of Finnish youngsters keen on Kong Fu. The parade then marched to the main promenade in the central shopping district, where an outdoor show was on stage for four hours despite the freezing temperature. The performance was given by Beijing National Orchestra, Long Yun Martial Arts Group and Beijing City Contemporary Dance Company, all arriving in Finland only days before. Dozens of booths demonstrating Chinese folklores were put up along the promenade. At the booth of Beijing Tourism Committee, people were seen lining up for trying on dramatic costumes, while others were sightseeing Chinese tourism attractions with VR glasses. At the booth of the Finnish food company Atria, visitors queued for the braised pork snacks cooked in Chinese style. One of the chefs said over 2,000 plates were handed out in just four hours. The company recently got the license to export raw pork to China, and became the first time sponsor of the Temple Fair. Twelve newly carved zodiac ice sculptures were seen placed in various locations, including the railway station square, pedestrian streets, and the commercial centers. On an ice ring at the railway station square, girls from Finnish figure skating clubs danced against the musical background of Chinese theatrical singing. Approaching 18:00 local time, or 00:00 Beijing time, Chinese Ambassador to Finland Chen Li and the Mayor of Helsinki Jan Vapaavuori addressed a thousands-strong audience and led the countdown to the Chinese Lunar New Year. Synchronized with the New Year bells ringed in Beijing, fireworks were set off at the temple fair venue in Helsinki. Two hours later, a massive firework show was given near the Toolo Bay 500 meters away. Like in previous years, it was estimated that some 40,000 viewers took part in the event on Thursday. As no more than 5,000 Chinese nationals live in the capital city of Finland, the Temple Fair has obviously become an indispensable festival for locals in Helsinki's winter calendar.,In an interview with Xinhua, Vapaavuori said the celebration used to take place on only one street but the venue extended to the nearby squares this year. In the past 11 years, a temple fair was held and completed in one evening, but this year's celebration lasted half a month. An event named "Happy Spring Festival - Beijing Week" took place in Helsinki in late January, focusing on startup competitions, technology seminars and business match-making. For the first time in 12 years, the issues of business, technology and sports, among others, were put into the Spring Festival basket of Helsinki. "Chinese New Year celebration is getting bigger and bigger in Helsinki," said Vapaavuori. In the Chinese zodiac system, the period of twelve years concludes a cycle. As the Year of Dog arrives, analysts believe that the Spring Festival, originating from China, has gone beyond borders and to some extent has become a cultural event shared by the world. Ma Wen, deputy inspector of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture, said that the celebration of Spring Festival particularly in Finland has developed in a natural way where the local partners play a key role and the event is broadly accepted by Finns. "Beijing is the only sister city of Helsinki, and Finns regard Chinese people as friends," said Vapaavuori.
0	When it comes to eating out, the Chinese public is increasingly turning to branded chains. New research from the Industry Development Department of China Cuisine Association, or CCA, shows that consumers are paying growing attention to food and service quality, and consumption has become more brand-oriented than price-oriented. Nothing exemplifies this better than the serpentine queues of customers waiting patiently to enter a Western restaurant in WF Central, a high-end shopping mall in Beijing at 2 pm on any given working day. Much of that rush was centered on hungry customers wanting to enter Cafe Landmark, Jade Garden and The Cheesecake Factory, the three restaurants launched simultaneously by Hong Kong-based food and beverage company Maxim's Group in Beijing. Incidentally Maxim's is also popular for its Maxim's mooncakes. "I have been expecting the brand to launch in Beijing for a long time. To get seated, my friends and I waited for one and a half hours. The dishes and service, which are exactly the same as we had in the United States, are worth the wait," said a consumer who just finished her meal at The Cheesecake Factory, an American restaurant that traces its origins to California in 1978. "The reason why we introduced the three brands to Beijing at the same time is that we want to use the combination effect of the brands to set off a craze in the city, attracting customer loyalty," said Martin Lee, chief operating officer of Maxim's Caterers Ltd. The huge queues in front of The Cheesecake Factory have already proved the success of the company. The food and beverage market is continuously expanding, with branding being the biggest trend, boosting the development of the market. Driven by consumption upgrade and the rapidly evolving city construction, a growing number of international brands, such as Starbucks and Japanese ramen restaurant Ippudo, are now eyeing the local market. Companies are now laying more emphasis on building and preserving brand image, and competition in the market has evolved from competition between product categories to a full-fledged brand battle, an indication that the development of the catering industry has come to a new stage. According to the latest report by the National Bureau of Statistics, China's total retail sales of consumer goods hit 36.6 trillion yuan ($5.80 trillion) last year, with the income from catering businesses taking up 10.8 percent, which was 3.96 trillion yuan. With a 10.7-percent year-on-year growth rate, the volume of the nation's catering sector ranked just next to that of the United Kingdom. The 2017 report by the CCA also pointed out that the nation's catering income has been rising steadily year-on-year and having a positive impact on the whole consumer market. According to the report, in 2017, the catering market had an 11.3 percent contribution rate on the consumption market. According to official statistics from the provincial statistics bureaus, first-tier cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou crawled out of recession in the catering market. In 2017, the catering income of Beijing and Shanghai reached 102.8 billion yuan and 102.5 billion yuan, growing 7.7 percent and 7.9 percent respectively. Meanwhile, the sales revenue of Guangdong's catering industry rose 5.9 percent to 368 billion yuan, ranking first in the country. Jiang Junxian, president of the CCA, said in an interview with Xinhua that branding of food and beverages is becoming increasingly apparent. Apart from the taste, the environment, service and user experience of a restaurant have all become core competitiveness points. "As people's living standards rise, rather than the price, they focus more on the taste, service quality and brand culture, which creates the distinctive character of a brand. This is why we have been devoted to building different unique brands," said Lee from Maxim's. "We are confident about the catering market in China where tremendous growth potential lies. Therefore, we will continue to explore more characteristic brands, offering more choices for consumers of different consumption levels," Lee added.
0	City dwellers no longer need to search for long to find a place to exercise, as the nation's sports industry boom is prompting urban planning to evolve to suit citizens' growing demand for fitness and exercise spaces. Channel Five Sports Space, the first comprehensive public sports venue in Beijing, was launched on Aug 4. As a response to the nation's scientific health and fitness strategy, called Healthy China 2030, the Sports Space was established to integrate digital and physical resources for the public. "We are aiming to build the Yelp of the sports industry," said Hong Ping, president of ZhongShiLiangZhong (Beijing) Cultural Media Co Ltd, the company responsible for operating the Sports Space. "We are building a public sports service platform, integrating online and offline resources in all fields in the sports industry." In the 5,000-square-meter Sports Space, both young and old alike are able to enjoy a wide variety of activities, including table tennis, wrestling, taekwondo and aikido. LeFit, a new concept gym chain startup, was among the first fitness brands to open an outlet within the new venue. According to statistics from the General Administration of Sport, China currently only has 1.5 square meters of sports-dedicated space per capita, while the United States has 16 square meters. Most sports stadiums in China are owned by the government or schools. Sports areas open to the nation's sports, education and military sectors account for over 60 percent of the total, of which only 29.2 percent is accessible to the public. He Wenyi, executive director of Peking University's China Institute for Sports Value, said the central authorities' guideline issued in 2014 to promote the development of the sports industry has not yet been fully implemented. "The nation's public sports sector is in its infancy, but the potential is huge. Urban areas need to provide more facilities to boost participation in sports and satisfy the public's diverse needs and preferences," He said. "We hope Sports Space's business model can be applied to other regions in China. In the future, we may tap into this model further, such as building sports leisure towns and sports amusement parks," he said. According to ZhongShiLiangZhong, the company plans to open more Sports Spaces in other cities, including Shanghai, Tianjin and Xi'an in Shaanxi province. Its final goal is to establish more than 1,000 such spaces across over 100 cities in China.

Flourishing cultural exchanges have been held in China and Hungary to promote mutual understanding between the two nations in recent years. The Beijing Film and TV International Show lifted the curtain in Budapest, Hungary, on April 23. The show kicked off with performances prepared by Hungarian dancers and pop singers, before showing trailers of Chinese productions. "Within the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative, more and more Chinese film and TV productions have become accessible for Hungarians," said Wang Wei, director of planning and development for the Beijing Municipal Radio and Television Bureau. "This kind of cultural exchange can facilitate interpersonal bonds between Hungarian and Chinese and will create a solid base for further cooperation between the two countries," he stressed. Maria Pap, an official from the Hungarian National Tourist Office, said: "Budapest is a very important tourist attraction and destination here in Central Europe. I am delighted to see more and more Chinese tourists coming to Hungary." It was one of many events to demonstrate Chinese culture and China's unique landscapes to Hungarian people in recent times. Organized by Beijing's culture and tourism bureau, a promotional event named Charming Beijing was held in Budapest in March. Representatives from the bureau hosted in-depth discussions with local tourism businesses aiming to further expand partnerships. Forty images of historical landmarks in Beijing including the Forbidden City and the Great Wall were displayed. Organized by the Hungarian-Chinese Cultural Association, a three-day Chinese Spring Festival celebration took place in Hungary in January with the support of the Chinese embassy in Hungary.,The festival celebration had a panda exhibition, a cultural heritage exhibition that included painting and calligraphy, a tea ceremony and tea tasting, and a demonstration of traditional Chinese medicine. A special zodiac stamp issued in honor of the 2019 Chinese Year of the Pig was presented during the event. On the red stamp, a chubby pig can be seen covered in a flower motif, under a sign saying "Year of Pig 2019". It is the sixth edition of a Hungarian stamp commemorating the Chinese Spring Festival since the first was issued in 2014, the Year of Horse. Dancers, singers and musicians from Northwest China's Gansu province staged a performance entitled Magical Silk Road. It was inspired by the famous Dunhuang frescoes, which attracted more than 600 people in June 2018 in Hungary. Hungary, known for its abundant cultural and natural resources, and as the home of poet Sandor Petofi, was also keen to present its culture to Chinese people.,A Hungarian contemporary art exhibition in Chengdu, Sichuan province, which ran from March 29 to April 20, presented the work of six Hungarian artists. The Modern Art Exhibition of Hungary, which took place at the National Art Museum of China last year, brought together dozens of paintings and sculptures. They look back on the dynamic and various schools of Hungarian fine art over the past century. A total of 99 paintings and 24 sculptures were on display. Looking ahead, China is willing to maintain high-level exchanges with Hungary, consolidate political mutual trust, and push bilateral practical cooperation forward, according to one of China's State leaders. China will support its citizens traveling to Hungary and is willing to expand people-to-people and cultural exchanges to further consolidate public support for stronger bilateral relations. The state leader of Hungary said China and Hungary will celebrate the 70th anniversary of their diplomatic ties this year. Hungary is willing to continue to deepen practical cooperation with China, accelerate the use of the Hungarian section of the Belgrade-Budapest railway, and enhance cooperation in areas including agriculture and tourism.
1	Chinese teenagers and young children these days take up a lot of extracurricular courses, both after school and on the weekend. And fine art training is one of the most favored among the non-academic programs. This year¡¯s Fourth Biennial of Teenager and Children¡¯s Art showcased the creativity and imagination of young artists from across the country with a selection of some 800 paintings and calligraphic works. The works featured at the show were on the environment.

0	Construction began on Wednesday morning on a new intercity railway between Beijing and the Xiongan New Area that will shorten travel time to half an hour. The railway will be 92.4 kilometers long with an investment of 33.53 billion yuan ($5.29 billion). It will have five stations that begin at Liying Station along the Beijing-Kowloon Railway, and will run through Daxing district in Beijing, Beijing's new airport and Bazhou in Hebei province, ending in Xiongan. The Beijing section that runs from Liying to the new airport will begin service in September 2019, when the new airport opens. The design speed of the section will be 250 km/h. The section from the new airport to Xiongan will be put into operation by the end of 2020, with a design speed of 350 km/h. When the full railway is operational, the travel time from downtown Beijing to Xiongan will be reduced to half an hour. The Xiongan New Area, established in April 2017, is a new economic zone about 100 kilometers southwest of Beijing in Hebei. It is the third new area of national significance after the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone and the Shanghai Pudong New Area.

Well, it's maybe a bit of both. All aboard a high-speed train hurtling across the Chinese landscape at speeds up to 300 kilometers an hour! During this nine-minute video, the coin kept its balance, prompting a surge in online viewers worldwide. Some took to performing similar experiments on high-speed trains in their own countries¡­ with varying levels of success! Although the Japanese high-speed train is also great, do you think that it is the safest? Or Shinkansen is the fastest? Think again! Chinese high-speed rail ¨C or CRH ¨C stands out in front, commanding the top-6 places in world speed rankings and some 60% of global high-speed track mileage.  The Beijing-to-Shanghai high-speed train has even clocked in speeds up to 480 kilometers an hour. That's about 300 miles an hour! And with this high speed, the time to travel from New York to Washington could be shortened from the original 3h50min to 53.5min.  In 2017, the Renaissance EMU train achieved an average 350 km-per-hour journey between Beijing and Shanghai. That kind of speed would get you from London to Edinburgh in less than two hours. But the price is just a mere 20 pounds or so. In fact, China sells the cheapest high-speed train tickets in the world, which means if a Londoner gets on a Chinese high-speed train on Friday after work, it will be very easy to travel to Edinburgh and enjoy the most authentic Scotch whisky there.  "High-speed rail changes life." That is why China keeps building it. Since high-speed rail debuted in China with the Beijing-to-Tianjin link in 2008, China has built four east-west high-speed lines across the country and four north-south routes. Along with its extensive high-speed rail networks, China has been transformed into a vast, economically-connected transportation network. Departing from Beijing in the morning, you can go to Shanghai to have a meeting and arrive in Hangzhou in the afternoon to enjoy beautiful scenery and eat local delicious sweet and sour fish near West Lake. At night, you can return to Beijing at 10pm, right on time. It is easy to shuttle between three cities in just one day. Nowadays, there are many young people choosing to live a twins life -- living in a quiet city while working in a bustling city. The transportation time is only an hour while the cost is as low as 16 US dollars. Different from other countries, high-speed rail construction in China receives government subsidies and support. It has also been constantly upgraded in the past five years. As high-speed rail increases the flow of economic and trade exchanges, it also facilitates the mobility of population and enterprises, allowing smaller cities to develop alongside major metropolises. As you know that in comparison to other forms of transportation, high-speed rail means reductions in noise, pollution, and energy consumption. Therefore, China can protect the environment with its best efforts, while still pursuing fast economic development. There are so many benefits about high-speed rail, no wonder that China has never stopped with its upgrades. In the past five years, under the leadership of Chinese President Xi Jinping, China is no longer satisfied with just having high-speed rail and its national system.

0	Problems that arose in the past related to administrative disputes have been alleviated, according to a report released on Thursday by a Beijing court. The Beijing No 4 Intermediate People's Court, selected as part of a pilot program to improve hearings of administrative cases, said in its report that it accepted 2,893 administrative disputes last year, twice the amount it accepted in 2015. The increase can be attributed to the court's strict and effective measures for filing cases, which means all appeals in line with laws were accepted immediately after registration, instead of being subject to a court review, as was the case previously, it said. To reduce interference from governments when courts hear administrative disputes, judicial reform implemented by the central leadership in 2013 required the intermediate people's court to handle administrative cases involving the suing of governments of the city's 16 districts. Under the requirement, the intermediate people's court was established in December 2014. Last year, all 16 district governments in the capital were sued, with the biggest number of cases involving the Haidian, Dongcheng, Xicheng and Chaoyang governments, it said. "Almost 70 percent of the cases were related to people's livelihood," said Cheng Hu, vice-president of the court. "Many conflicts between residents and governmental departments involved the renovation of old buildings, demolitions and environmental improvements." Cheng complimented the attitude of administrations, saying that every governmental department involved in cases had taken the initiative to attend the court, respond to litigants' questions and solve disputes. "The previous problem that many citizens complained of ¡ª about it being too hard to confront officials in courtrooms ¡ª has been alleviated," he said. In addition, governmental departments as defendants lost 79 lawsuits, of which about 20 percent were related to the disclosure of official information, the report said. "Some governmental departments were sued because they didn't handle or delayed administrative affairs, while others failed to follow administrative procedures while handling the affairs," Cheng said.
0	Beijing's transportation commission released a new regulation on Wednesday barring passengers from eating or drinking on the subway in a move intended to create a more comfortable space for travelers. Uncivilized behavior, such as selling products or playing loud music, are also banned under the regulation. Violations will be included in the passenger's credit record, and the person could be forbidden from taking the subway in the future, the commission said. The commission also assigned special inspectors and supervisors to identify improper behavior on subway trains. Prohibitions against smoking electronic cigarettes and using counterfeit tickets were also added to the rules. Liu Daizong, China transport program director at the World Resources Institute, applauded the new measure and said that as an enclosed space, a subway car will be filled with odors if passengers are allowed to have food. "These smells easily cause disputes between passengers, but there was no basis for law enforcement officers to get involved before," he said. In January, a woman surnamed Wang sparked heated discussion online after she was filmed eating snacks and spitting out the food debris onto the floor of a car on Beijing's Line 13. She was later found by netizens to be the same woman previously filmed eating chicken claws and spitting out bones in a Shanghai subway car. Netizens had dubbed her "chicken feet lady". Other passengers asked Wang to clean up her mess but she refused, leaving the food packages in the subway car when she got off. She was later detained by police in Beijing on suspicion of disrupting public transport. Liu, who is also a member of the expert committee of the Beijing transport commission, said eating food on subways has become widespread worldwide, especially in big cities, as people commute to work. Cities like Singapore, Nanjing and Xiamen have already banned drinking and eating on the subway, which provides a much cleaner environment for travelers, he said. Beijing, as an international metropolis, needs to catch up and provide a more civilized public space for commuters. But some passengers in Beijing questioned the strictness of the new regulation. Han Yanni, a 26-year-old white collar worker in the finance industry in Beijing, said drinking water and nibbling bread is her daily routine on the subway, especially in the morning rush. "Except for onions or sunflower seeds, I can put up with most of the eating behaviors," she said. "Especially if they take a garbage bag for their trash."
0	An exquisite porcelain teapot. Several fine ceramic cups. A small vase and a flower. A piece of calligraphy introducing tea making procedures. These fives things adorn a traditional Chinese tea table. With a touch of Chinese aesthetic, the table is almost an artwork in the form of modern installation. Another piece was inspired by  a masterpiece by Song Dynasty (960-1279) painter Wang Ximeng. The painting was featured on cups and table flag which were decorated with black mountain-shaped sculptures. A total of 30 such tables, from both Chinese mainland and Taiwan, were featured at the First Exchange of Tea Culture Between Beijing and Taiwan at Grand Millennium Beijing on June 24. "Tomorrow marks the 30th year since the first time when I visited the Chinese mainland on June 25, 1988. In the past three decades, I have come to mainland 300 times," Fan Zengping, director-general of the Taiwan Chinese Tea Culture Association, said at the event. The 300 times saw his promotion of Chinese tea culture in both Chinese mainland and Taiwan. For him, tea has become a mirror of life. Sipping a cup of tea is a way to meditating on life. "We need to cherish the achievements of exchanges between mainland and Taiwan, and picture a better future for we Chinese people who have the same root," Fan said. Chen Yunjun, standing director of China International Tea Culture Institute, talked about the differences of tea culture in China and Japan as well as the relation between Chinese tea culture and Zen. "Japanese tea ceremony is famous for its silent rites, yet only a few people have tea or matcha daily. Most Japanese drink sencha. However, tea is part of Chinese people's everyday life," Chen said. Quoting Buddhist master Jinghui on tea culture, Chen said the spirit of Chinese tea culture can boil down to four Chinese characters:   (Õı integrity),   (Çå purity),   (ºÍ harmony) and   (ÑÅ elegance). "Our traditional tea culture is an important cultural heritage that connects people in Chinese mainland and Taiwan. We hope it will go on to play bigger role, bridging the two sides closely." About 100 tea masters and representatives attended the event, sharing the same passion for Chinese tea culture.
0	Workers who lose their jobs because of Beijing¡¯s efforts to relocate noncapital functions to neighboring regions will receive compensation to soften the blow, a senior official said on Wednesday. The city government is moving manufacturers and wholesale markets, as well as other industries, to outlying areas to ease pressure on resources and reduce congestion. Experts say layoffs are inevitable. However, Liu Xiaojun, head of employment promotion for the Beijing Human Resources and Social Security Bureau, said a subsidy will be paid to those affected while they search for alternative employment, according to a Beijing News report. To qualify, workers will have to satisfy two conditions: they need to have contributed to social security insurance; and they need to have been laid off instead of resigning. The amount paid will depend on their social security insurance contributions, while migrant workers will be required to proof from their former employer that they were laid off. Liu was speaking at a job fair in the capital¡¯s Dongcheng district on Wednesday. He said more job fairs will be organized in the run-up to Spring Festival, which falls on Feb 16.
0	The recently concluded 9th Beijing International Film Festival has seen 40 projects from 77 companies, with a total value to 30.9 billion yuan ($4.6 million), surging 18.48 percent year on year. The projects cover a wide range of segments, from scheduled-to-produce films to establishing funds for filmmaking. One bit of exciting news for sports fans is the unveiling of plans for a film titled Ice Hockey on Fire, which aims to chronicle the history of China¡¯s national ice hockey team.The biographical drama is scheduled to be a tribute to the 2022 Winter Olympics, which will take place from April 4 to 20 in Beijing. Xu Yiwen, an investor in the film, says ice hockey is a contact sports which demands teamwork. Director Miao Sheng says the film is his sports-themed debut. The script is complete and casting is on, says Miao. For history buffs, a China-Sri Lanka coproduction with the working title   will provide an interesting perspective of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). The film is based on story of a Crown Prince of Ceylon (Sri Lanka¡¯s colonial name), who visited to China as an emissary with navigator Zheng He and his expeditionary fleet in 1459. Zhang Chenzheng, the chief of the international department of the China Film Producers Association, says the film will resonate with audiences both in China and Sri Lanka. Aside from the films, a fund launched by Beijing-based Jade Blossom and Tangshan-based Tang Wen Pictures will raise 300 million yuan, the first batch of a series of phases, to encourage creations on mid-and small-budget films.
0	Hidden in a residential complex off the North Third Ring Road in Beijing is a potentially lucrative cottage industry with an attitude. Its main wall, decorated with vinyl discs, movie posters and images of rock bands, presents the look of a music and movie bar. But Li Boxing Club pulsates with a different kind of energy. "Since I was very young, I always wanted a boxing club of my own, a small space that all my friends could come and have a good time at," said its owner, who is in his early 30s and prefers to be called A-li, as if in tribute to boxing legend Muhammad Ali. A-li hails from the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. The front wall of the club has a landscape painted on it, a portrayal of the regional capital's landmark Drum Tower. That's the area where A-li's dream started. "Back then, we had a very small venue, with a small balcony outside. We had a lot of fun there when we finished training. We used to drink, smoke and chat while looking at this beautiful Drum Tower," A-li said. "Fun" included mischief and an iota of street vandalism, like stealing posters from the light box at the local bus stop. Fun got extended in another form as a career beckoned. He moved to four different locations, before finally settling down at the current location. He invested 300,000 yuan ($43,800) to buy the small venue, which has now grown into a very busy club. His personal training class, priced 800 yuan per hour, is always fully booked, he said. That's because for many club members, who range from city white-collar executives to artists and celebrities, boxing is not just a sport but a part of their life. "I'm a man, I'm not a coward or a loser. They said boxing is hard. Come on, life is much harder," said Wu Di, the lead vocal artist of a Beijing-based rockabilly band Rolling Bowling. He's been practising boxing for a few years, but it was only in 2015 that he started to learn seriously at A-Li's club. "It's like everything else. Hard work will pay off. There is no such thing as genius in this sport," he said. "You need to learn scientifically, learn how to control your muscles, manage your breath and prepare your body for the one accurate and powerful punch. "You need to stay sharp, focused and brave and always try to push yourself to a higher level. Just like playing music, practice is the core, there is no genius." After a tour of Guizhou, he and his band were back in Beijing for a short break, before embarking on a fresh tour to Lanzhou city for a music festival. A musician and an amateur boxer, Wu credits boxing, his hobby, for his enriched life. "Before I met my girlfriend, my life was much simpler£­training, working on my music, then training again, until I fell asleep.",Boxing, he said, appears like a violent combat on the surface, but scratch it, and you will see that it is a rational sport that needs a scientific approach, Wu said. "Before I joined the club, I was learning it by myself. Years ago, when I went to a boxing club in Italy, they didn't even bother to take a look at me." Back then, Wu's frame was more music buff than boxer. But music and boxing share a few features, he said. "Many think singing is dependent only on one's voice or throat. It's not the case at all. It requires your full body's attention and a singer needs to use the power or energy that is at his or her core. Similarly, boxing requires every muscle to get involved. "Boxing is not as popular as before, because it takes too long to cultivate a champion. Sometimes, it takes over 30 years of training. Boxing is a foreign sport. It lacks the tradition in China. So this sport is facing difficulties in its development because it's too hard. Anyone from a wealthy family is not likely to make much effort to learn the art." He said boxing is like his favorite music genre. "Vintage American-style rock-n-roll is an awesome style, but people don't recognize it." He said more and more people like him have turned to boxing. Recreation sports are emerging as a viable, even lucrative, business segment, he said. Agreed Cai Jialong, founder of Long FC, a game based on mixed martial arts. "In China, there are over 80 million boxing fans. With such a large crowd of potential fans, combat sports and even players may fare better in the future. "The major demographic for this market are those aged between 18 and 30 with a relatively strong consumption power and open mind. They tend to accept the culture of combat." Li Zhipeng, partner of BW Venture Capital, which used to invest in the country's popular workout app Keep, said more games and commercial competitions can encourage more people to take part in recreation sports with a combat element. "Combat sports are a nascent business. People in this business are approaching it like parents would view an infant£­without undue hurry about growth and future. We don't want to talk about profits right now." But he predicted top combat players in China will be able to earn 100 million yuan annually five years from now.
0	Over 600 people gathered on Friday morning in front of the new office buildings of the Beijing municipal government in Tongzhou district for a flag-raising ceremony, marking that the government has formally begun work in the new location. Those in attendance included the Party chief of the capital Cai Qi, Mayor Chen Jining, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Beijing Municipal People's Congress Li Wei, and Chairman of the Beijing Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) Ji Lin. Following the ceremony, these four distinguished individuals also inaugurated the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Beijing Municipal People's Government, the Beijing Municipal People's Congress, and the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPPCC.,So far, 35 municipal government departments and 165 agencies, with about 120,000 employees, have relocated their offices to Lucheng town in Tongzhou district. On Thursday evening, the nameplate on the government's old main building in the downtown area was taken off and handed over to the archives. Beijing is shifting some of its administrative functions out of the city center to Tongzhou to help address problems including traffic congestion and air pollution. The move is also part of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei integrated development plan.,"Beijing will make every effort in implementing the design of the sub-center of Beijing," Vice-Mayor of Beijing Sui Zhenjiang said at a policy briefing of the State Council Information Office on Friday, stressing that environmental protection would be a top priority of the new sub-center. The previous chemical plant in Tongzhou will be restructured into a forest park of 11 square kilometers, with a theater, library and museum as supplemental facilities. The central business district of the sub-center, together with an integrated traffic hub, will connect Tianjin, Tangshan in Hebei province, and the suburbs of Beijing. "Historical and cultural protection, especially protection of the historical sites in Lucheng town, Tongzhou district, is another major task of the sub-center building," said Sui, adding that intelligent management is a new feature of the sub-center. Beijing's sub-center, which sits in the east of the capital, aims to accommodate 1.3 million permanent residents by 2035. The city sub-center will cover 155 sq km and be extended to the whole area of the current Tongzhou district, which has a total of about 906 sq km, according to the plan for the sub-center's development for 2016 to 2035, approved by the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council.

1	A design contest on the traditional agricultural calendar unleashed the artistic talent of young people. China Daily reports.  According to the Chinese lunar calendar, the Autumnal Equinox (qiufen) is the day when night and day are of equal length. After that day, the location of direct sunlight moves to the south, making the days shorter and nights longer in the northern hemisphere. Part of the cultural heritage of China, the 24 Solar Terms embody Chinese people's experience and knowledge of astronomy, phenology and agricultural meteorology. The 24 Solar Terms was included in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists in November. On this year's qiufen, which fell on Sept 23, the awards ceremony for the Logo Design Contest for China's 24 Solar Terms was held in the capital as part of this year's Beijing Design Week. The contest was open to both professionals and juveniles, and 1,520 design works from 97 primary schools and 125 communities in Beijing were received in the juvenile group, of which dozens won awards of best design and most creative, and 60 finalists were shortlisted.,  Zeng Hui, planning director of Beijing Design Week, initiated by the Ministry of Culture and the People's Government of Beijing Municipality, says the students' works embodied their own visual interpretations of the calendar. "Teenagers learned about the solar terms through design, which helped raise their awareness of nature and the life cycle of the seasons," Zeng says. Huang Yifei, 11, a 6th-grade student at the Affiliated Primary School of Beijing Petroleum College, won a best design award for a drawing of White Dew (bailu). "I learned about the 24 Solar Terms in kindergarten and I've also learned a song about them in primary school," Yifei says. "White Dew is my favorite solar term as it's very poetic. It indicates the real beginning of autumn." This year's White Dew was on Sept 7, and Yifei read many poems about this solar term before finally choosing a poem by Du Fu, a Tang Dynasty (618-907) poet, as her inspiration. "Du's poem goes, 'The dew starts to be white from tonight and the moon is brighter in my hometown'," says Yifei. "In Du's poem, he expressed his homesickness by hearing a wild goose's honk on an autumn night.",  "I drew a full moon because the White Dew is near mid-autumn and used a dark color to show it was night. "I used a pen to draw the lines and then colored my design with marker pens," Yifei explains. Shao Liyuan, an art teacher at Cuiwei Primary School, was awarded the best tutor. "Our students were enthusiastic and creative about the design contest. More than 95 percent of the students in each class took part in the competition. We won a dozen awards," Shao says. The designs were all original ideas by the students. "As a tutor, I just helped them to accomplish their ideas," Shao says. "The competition also brought parents closer to their children, as they helped explain the solar terms." Yin Yue, the mother of Chen Sizhuo, 10, who won awards for designs for six solar terms including Rain Water (yushui) and Insects Awakening (jingzhe), says: "I searched the information of the solar terms and told my son the story of each solar term. We both learned together." Many primary schools in Beijing supported the competition. Fengtai No 1 Primary School organized hundreds of students to join the contest, and they worked in various mediums, including traditional Chinese painting, dough modeling and seal cutting. "We were surprised by the students' works. They were not just paintings, but designs," says Yin Nan, principal of Beijing Fengtai No 1 Primary School. "The competition provides a platform for our students, so they can be confident about themselves and care for nature at a young age." Some of the prize winners will visit UN headquarters in New York in February. "We encourage our students to go out," Yin says. "We want to see how creative our students can be."

0	President Xi Jinping paid an inspection visit to Xiongan New Area in Hebei province Wednesday morning. He was informed about the general plan of the State-level new area, its policies and construction process and have interactions with local people. This is Xi's second visit to Xiongan. His first tour took place on Feb 23, 2017, when he chaired a meeting for the plan and construction of Xiongan New Area. Hailed as part of the "millennium strategy", the new area was officially announced in April 2017. It is located about 100 km southwest of Beijing. Its main function is to serve as a development hub for the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei economic triangle. Additionally, "non-core" functions of the Chinese capital are expected to migrate here, including offices of some State-owned enterprises, government agencies, and research and development facilities.
0	Performers of shadow play, Peking Opera and acrobatics are displaying their skills at the Traditional Culture & Arts Week in Beijing. Chen Nan reports. Lu Baogang can still remember the day his father died of a heart attack in 1979. For Lu, who was 15 then, it felt like sky was falling. That year, as the youngest and only son of his family, Lu dropped out of school and started working with the Beijing Shadow Show Troupe, where his father was appointed as director days before he died. "My mother made the decision for me and I had to obey because I had to earn money to support my family," says Lu, who has four elder sisters. He was a top student in his class and his dream was to study in university and become a teacher after graduation. Standing in his office at the Beijing Shadow Show Troupe, which is based in a quiet and hidden hutong (alleyway) in the capital's Xicheng district, Lu, 53, who is now the director of the troupe, recalls the events like they happened yesterday. The art his father practiced was shadow play, also known as shadow puppetry, an ancient Chinese art form combining music, storytelling and puppets. The art, which took shape in the Western Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 24), reached its peak in the Tang (618-907) and Song (960-1279) dynasties. The troupe celebrates its 60th anniversary this year. And during the ongoing Traditional Culture & Arts Week, which kicked off on Oct 31 and runs through Nov 17, Lu is leading his troupe to display his family's craft. There were, at one time, two schools of shadow puppetry in Beijing: eastern and western. Although they originated from the same source, they were different when it came to performing styles. Lu is the fifth generation to follow his family's shadow play tradition, whose style is from the old western school.,  The Beijing Shadow Show Troupe, set up by the government in 1957, is an extension of the Lu family tradition. Since its founding, the troupe has received support from established Peking Opera masters, including Mei Lanfang, who had invited the troupe to perform at his home many times. "Shadow play and Peking Opera have a strong connection. Many repertoires, including The Journey to the West and White Snake Lady, were shared by shadow play and Peking Opera," says Lu. Like many traditional Chinese art forms, such as Peking Opera, shadow play has gone through rocky times, challenged by diverse contemporary entertainment. In 2008, shadow play was listed as a national intangible cultural heritage. What Lu wants to do is more than display this art form. "I want to revitalize this art form. I am proud of my family's tradition. But for decades, the troupe was losing talent and its market was declining. It would be a shame if this art form dies in my hands," says Lu. The troupe now has 11 actors, from their early 20s to their 50s, who give about 110 performances every year around the country. They also produce shadow puppet cartoons for television and do free shows to children during the summer vacation. For now, Lu is preparing for a new show to be premiered in 2018, which will integrate traditional shadow play with contemporary elements, like a multimedia stage set, to attract younger audiences. But he feels that there is much to be done. He says that by letting more people see the art form£­from the performances to the techniques of making shadow puppets£­people, especially the young, could be inspired by what they see and begin their own revival. Along with Lu's troupe, the ongoing Traditional Culture& Arts Week also features Beijing Fenglei Peking Opera Company, which celebrates its 80th anniversary; and the Beijing Acrobatic Troupe, which marks 60 years.,The two troupes are also performing their latest works at the festival. The Beijing Fenglei Peking Opera Company was on the verge of dying in 2001, but had a dramatic reversal of fortune thanks to Song Yan, now 53, a Peking Opera actor, who is also the director of the company. When Song became the director, he led the actors to give nearly 800 performances in 15 months, which helped it survive. Today, 16 years later, the company is one of the best-known Peking Opera companies in the country, doing about 600 shows a year. The company premiered its work, Ke Si Jian Yi, at the Tianqiao Performing Arts Center on Nov 1 and 2, which is about the people who rented costumes to Peking Opera troupes in the 1930s. The show is the second of a trilogy by Song, in which he combines theater with Peking Opera. The first show, titled Wang Zi, premiered in October 2015. It tells the story of a father and his adopted son in Beijing in the 1930s. Speaking about the challenges traditional art forms are facing, Song, who joined the troupe when he was 12, says: "Though they are different, there is one thing in common. People who learn these arts have to be patient and focused. You have to isolate yourself from the outside world, which is full of commercial benefits and a variety of entertainments. It takes years and even decades to master these techniques. That's why these arts are timeless and can still be appreciated by audiences centuries later." The Beijing Acrobatic Troupe will present a show, which won a gold medal at the Paris' Festival Mondial du Cirque de Demain (The World Festival of the Circus of Tomorrow) in 1995. Beijing Tianqiao Zenith Investment Group Co Ltd, which manages the three troupes, says they did more than 1,400 shows in 2016, which attracted more than 400,000 people. And in another bit of good news, the government of Xicheng district has received approval for a project to build a heritage center in the Tianqiao area, once a haven for folk arts and small businesses in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, to promote shadow puppetry and acrobatics. Xu Li, the deputy head of Xicheng district, says: "These troupes are national treasures, and they have performed in other countries in cultural exchange programs, introducing Chinese culture to international audiences." The Traditional Culture & Arts Week is running through Nov 17, featuring performances and exhibitions at Tianqiao Performing Arts Center. 9 Tianqiao Nandajie, Xicheng district, Beijing. 400-635-3355.

"China is the third-largest recipient of FDI in the world. Beijing appears keen to continue to improve China's attractiveness to foreign investors with its continued plans to cut red tape for foreigners and its announcement to increase foreign investment in healthcare, education, sports and culture. If implementation of these reforms is successful and the new rules are transparently applied, then China's FDI inflows may grow even more in the coming years," said Dan Starta, Partner and Head of Greater China at A.T. Kearney. The index is a forward-looking analysis of how political, economic, and regulatory changes will likely affect FDI inflows into countries in the coming years.

0	Maxime and Lise, a young French couple,are ready to travel across China from Beijing in North to Yunnan province in Southwest on a tandem bicycle in a bid to encourage green travel.  Maxime, 26, works helping herdsmen better raise and take care of their dairy cattle, while his wife Lise, 26, is a speech-language pathologist. The two like sharing their travel stories on Facebook to advocate green travel.  "We choose a tandem bicycle because it makes it easier to communicate with each other about beautiful landscapes we come across during the journey. Besides, bicycling is an economic and environment-friendly way of traveling in comparison to using motors, vehicles and so on," the couple said in a letter to a photographer.      The two said the aim of their journey is to get locals' good ideas on topics such as health, economy, biology, agriculture and politics. They said they chose to visit China because they often talked about how much of the country is very competitive in developing renewable energy resources.  "We know China is a densely-populated country and will be the leader of the global economy in the future. We want to get a better understanding of the country and its residents. We love the country," they said.

0	For TwoziBalloons, a professional balloon services provider, Christmas is especially busy as more customers order Christmas-themed balloons to decorate their homes. Six years ago, TwoziBalloons founders Zheng Zhong and Ni Miaomiao found an opportunity in balloons and started their workshop in Hangzhou, East China's Zhejiang province, which turned into a successful business. Ni fell in love with balloons when she was a child. However, even in Beijing, the capital city, it's difficult to find a good balloon store. Sometime, she saw peddlers selling balloons in the street, but the quality was not good, and the balloons popped quickly. Ni started spending lots of time attending special training courses to learn more about balloons and contacted insiders to improve design creativity. As more people began to pay attention to holiday spirit, TwoziBalloons launched its store on Taobao, China's biggest online shopping platform, in 2016, as Taobao had become an essential part for most young people. Now, Zheng Zhong and Ni Miaomiao have become a couple, and their 20-person team has become an icon in Beijing, Zhejiang and Fujian provinces. Either online or offline, TwoziBalloons adheres to quality, putting more efforts to incorporate more popular elements into balloon design. "No matter how far we develop, we'll not forget why we started this business," Zheng said.
0	The Chicago Symphony Orchestra is touring Asia from Jan 19 to Feb 4, featuring a diverse set of works, including symphonies of Brahms and Tchaikovsky and Rimsky-Korsakov's orchestral showpiece Sheherazade, as well as Verdi's Requiem. With stops in five Asian cities, the orchestra plays at the Oriental Arts Center in Shanghai on Jan 22 and 23, and at the National Centre for the Performing Arts in Beijing on Jan 25 and 26. According to Italian conductor, Riccardo Muti, who became the music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in 2010, the orchestra's touring history in Asia dating back to 1977. It first performed in Hong Kong in 1986 and made its debut in Shanghai and Beijing in 2009. "I was very impressed with the enthusiasm for classical music among the audiences in China. And it was clear to me that classical music and culture are important to today's audiences in China," says the conductor, who first performed with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in China in 2016. Asked about the music programs, he says that they "bring all the amazing colors of the Orchestra and its instruments into one piece that is filled with great imagination".,And he adds that the 128-year-old orchestra is made up of more than 100 musicians from all over the world, including 15 from from China, who contribute a great force to the orchestra. Among the Chinese musicians is Shanghai-born musician Chang Li-Kuo, who has been the assistant principal viola of the orchestra since 1988, appointed by Sir Georg Solti, a long-serving music director of the orchestra from 1969 to 1991. > Introduced to music by his pianist mother, Chang studied violin and piano at the affiliated middle school of Shanghai Conservatory. One of the first Chinese students to study classical music in the United States, Chang came to the US with a full scholarship at the Eastman School of Music and a young artist fellow at the Music Academy of the West in 1979. Speaking of how he joined the orchestra, Chang says: "I can still recall how nervous I was when I did the audition of applying to the Chicago Symphony Orchestra more than 30 years ago. Back then, few Chinese musicians played in the US," recalls Chang. "I won the audition in 1988, but before that I had applied three times. The first two times I gave up because I was so nervous." Chang adds that he is proud that Chinese musicians are playing an important role in many world class orchestras. "They have to work much harder to get recognition because classical music is a foreign culture to the Chinese," he says. "It is like an American who goes to China to study Peking Opera and tries to compete with all the Chinese performers."
0	Tax payers who have filed their income tax papers themselves or through agents can apply for tax certificate regardless of whether they have actually paid the tax, news site bjnews.com reported on Monday.  It is the latest step by Beijing service center of the State Taxation Administration to heed taxpayers' practical concerns, following the amended individual income tax law that came into effect on Jan 1. The new rules, especially the additional deductions that cover six categories, have reduced the amount of income tax individuals have to pay and eased their burden. The deductions can be claimed through an app specially developed by the tax authority. However, the new threshold of 5,000 yuan ($724) introduced in October, along with the additional deductions, has exempted some taxpayers from paying any income tax, which means there will be no record of declaration on the app. This has worried some taxpayers working in Beijing: As people without local   (permanent household registration) are not allowed to buy a house or car unless they can provide a record that they've paid income tax and social security payments for five consecutive years. A break in tax payment record will definitely affect their ability to access other services. The timely promise of keeping a running record of tax payment from the country's tax authorities will no doubt dispel those taxpayers' concerns while guaranting their benefits from tax deductions. Previously, the tax bureau removed the requirement for tenants to provide information about property owners when applying for a tax deduction against their rental payments. Before the adjustment, tenants had to submit their landlords' personal information to the bureau to claim a 1,000 yuan ($147) exemption every month. In response, landlords said they would either increase the rent to cover the rental income tax or discourage tenants from applying for tax deduction. According to the Beijing municipal tax bureau, the comprehensive tax rate for rental has been reduced to 2.5 percent from the previous 5 percent, including individual income tax and house property tax.
1	Wang Fuman, better known on the internet as "Snowflake Boy", finished a three-day tour of Beijing on Sunday. He visited the capital with his father and his sister at the invitation of two media organizations. The family from Zhaotong, Yunnan province, watched the flag-raising ceremony at Tian'anmen Square and visited several places related to law enforcement during the visit, including the city's SWAT headquarters and a top police-training university. "The biggest difference between Beijing and my hometown is Beijing isn't cold but my hometown is," 8-yearold Wang said by phone on Sunday. "Beijing is much warmer than my home because every family here has heating, but we can only warm ourselves by burning wood." Wang, who was nicknamed "Snowflake Boy" after a picture of his ice-covered hair went viral on Jan 8, was invited with his family to visit the capital by chinapeace.gov.cn£­official news website of the Communist Party of China Central Committee's Politics and Law Commission£­and btime.com. Chinapeace.gov.cn said on Sina Weibo that the family arrived by air on Friday afternoon, marking the first time Wang and his 10-year-old sister had flown in a plane. That afternoon, they visited the Beijing Police Museum and received gifts from city police officers. On Saturday morning, the family witnessed the flag-raising ceremony at Tian'anmen Square. "That's my favorite tour in Beijing," Wang said at a news conference on Sunday. After leaving the square, Wang and his sister tried rock climbing and touched a real gun, overseen by the Beijing SWAT team. The police officers also taught the children a few combat skills. "The real gun was a lot heavier than my toy guns," Wang said. "They (SWAT officers) train really hard every day, but I still want to be a policeman." The family also went to the People's Public Security University of China on Saturday afternoon. They visited the students' dormitory and were taught how to fold a quilt "as tight as tofu". Wang Dawei, one of the professors, encouraged Wang Fuman to work hard and "try to be admitted to our university", according to chinapeace.gov.cn. The now famous image of Wang Fuman was taken after he had walked more than 4 kilometers through freezing snow to reach school for a test. It sparked financial appeals and discussion on the standards at poor rural school. Wang's family lives in Zhuanshanbao village, which is located in a cold mountainous area. Both he and his sister, Wang Fumei, study at the village primary school. Their mother abandoned the family two years ago. "I want to study well and be a doctor who can cure my sick grandmother," Wang Fumei said. Wang Gangkui, the children's father, thanked people for their support at the news conference and added, "I just want my children to have a better and warmer school to study at, and have good jobs in the future."
0	Like a skillful slalom by an Olympic skier, Beijing has made good progress preparing to host the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games, officials said. While it has been just 18 months since the Chinese capital and co-host city Zhangjiakou, Hebei province, received the nod, full governmental support and the legacy of the 2008 Summer Games have helped with drafting major construction plans, training staff and rolling out sports promotions. "Preparation work is on the right track and will be sped up next year," the Organizing Committee for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games said in its annual report in December. Plans call for 25 competition and noncompetition venues for 2022. Among the 12 proposed in Beijing, 11 were built for the 2008 Games. The only new permanent venue, the National Speed Skating Oval, will be built at the site of the 2008 field hockey and archery competitions. A judges' panel is assessing 12 designs for the skating venue, down from 66 submitted in an international contest in June. Ground will be broken for the winning design in April. Construction of venues will start this year and be completed by 2019. Trial events will start in 2020, organizers said. "Reusing the 2008 legacy venues really helps Beijing 2022 stay ahead, while verifying Beijing's promise to host the Winter Olympics in a sustainable way," said Gui Lin, with the committee's department of planning, construction and sustainability. Construction also has begun on a high-speed railway linking downtown Beijing with Yanqing county and Zhangjiakou. Completion is set for the end of 2019. It will shorten a three-hour car ride between Beijing and Zhangjiakou to 50 minutes. The emblem for Beijing 2022 will be unveiled in the second half of 2017, with the recruitment of sponsors starting this year. The General Administration of Sport, China's top sports body, released plans in November to speed up construction of 650 skating rinks and 800 ski resorts to be built by 2022 to encourage 300 million people to participate in winter sports. After their first visit to Beijing in October, officials from the coordinating commission of the International Olympic Committee praised the host's sustainable approach, which is part of the vision of the Olympic Agenda 2020 road map. "We are pleased with what we have learned. Beijing 2022 is off to a fast start. Initial preparations are well on track," said IOC Vice-President Juan Antonio Samaranch, son of the former IOC president. "Our site visits confirmed that Beijing 2022 remains fully committed to the legacy goal of developing world-class winter sports facilities. Their success will accelerate growing participation in winter sports among the 300 million people in this region and throughout China," he said.

The daytime delivery girl turns to a livestreaming host at night, and interacts with her fans through singing, dancing, and chatting. Li earns about 20,000 yuan ($3,028) a month through her hard work, and uses most of her earnings to support her family. Watching World Cup while enjoying crawfish has become a new trend this summer, with crawfish orders jumping to a new high, especially after 9 pm. When asked whether the night orders worried her, Li smiled and said most night orders are assigned to male drivers and she is asked to deliver at night only in the neighborhood. "The city is much safer than we image," she added. Although Li is not a professional dancer - she learned most of the moves through self-taught videos - Li won the hearts of more than 30,000 online fans, with almost 10,000 of them showing up every time when she starts a livestreaming show. "I like her positive attitude toward life," one of her fans said. Li began to earn a living in Beijing five years ago and intends to stay in her dream city as it offers better opportunities. "Food delivery is a tough job, but it's a stable work," she said. I plan to launch my own business and do livestreaming part-time, she added.
0	BEIJING - The world was watching when China and the United States held economic and trade consultations in Beijing Thursday and Friday. What signals have the talks sent? What did the two sides discuss and what does the future hold? Stable economic and trade ties between the world's two biggest economies benefit not only themselves, but also the greater global economy. During the talks, the two sides agreed that a sound and stable China-US trade relationship is crucial for both, and they are committed to resolving relevant economic and trade issues through dialogue and consultation. They had thorough exchange of views on issues including increasing US exports to China, bilateral service trade, two-way investment, protection of intellectual property rights (IPR), as well as resolving tariff and non-tariff issues, reaching consensus in some areas. "It was a good time to reduce China-US trade frictions," said Song Guoyou, deputy director of Fudan University center for American studies. The meetings showed both sides willing to address economic and trade issues and narrow their disagreements through dialogue, Song said. By proposing a trip to China for consultations, the US side demonstrated the importance it attaches to China-US trade and economic issues, and its sincerity for addressing them. China and the United States can tackle trade frictions "in a rational, prudent manner," said Zhao Longyue, a professor at Guangdong University of Foreign Studies. "From the view of long-term development, win-win cooperation is the fundamental way to resolve these kinds of issues." "China and the United States are natural partners. Their economies are strongly complementary," said Wang Yong, a professor with Peking University school of international studies. For example, more US exports to China creates opportunities for US firms and products, while meeting the demands of Chinese consumers with better incomes for greater quality of life, Wang said. Talks like these, while candid and pragmatic, necessarily involve disagreements and bargaining. The Chinese side vigorously struck back at unsubstantiated accusations on issues including IPR and the unreasonable demand that it is up to China to reduce the US trade deficit, sources close to the talks said. Chinese negotiators firmly defended the interests of the nation and its people throughout, the sources said. China lodged solemn representations with the United States concerning the ZTE case during the consultations, a spokesperson with China's Ministry of Commerce said Friday. The US side said they attach importance to China's representations and will report China's stance to the US president. Li Yong of the China Association of International Trade, said that if agreement could be reached on the ZTE case, it would set an example for further high-tech cooperation between Chinese and American enterprises. "In this age of globalization, frictions are not solved by crippling others, a negative mindset, through coercion or by unilateral thinking. These approaches will hurt both Chinese and American enterprises. The world's industrial chains will also be damaged," said Li. Tu Xinquan, a professor with the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, said all negotiations need to be egalitarian. China never bows to pressure and maintains a principled stance. Equality, frankness, rationality and pragmatism are prerequisite to future consultations, he said. Both sides of the talks recognized that given that considerable differences still exist on some issues, continued hard work is required for more progress. They also agreed to stay in close communication on relevant issues and establish a corresponding work mechanism. Dong Yan with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences believes structural problems in the China-US economic and trade relationship are unavoidable, judging from the perspectives of history and international relations. "It's normal to have disparity and even friction, but these factors should not be allowed to set the direction of China-US cooperation," Dong said. Zhao Longyue said that China and the United States need to take a long-term view from the perspective of development. Instead of being burdened by trade deficits, both sides can exploit their respective advantages in different sectors in an active and cooperative manner, realizing resource complementarity, common development, mutual benefit and win-win results, he suggested. "We must not imagine one brief consultation will solve all our problems. Apart from sincerity, both sides need to show patience, and respect the policy environment of each other," said Li Yong. Both sides need frank, rational and pragmatic exchanges, to seek common ground and put their disagreements aside, maximize their converging interests, and be responsible to their people and the world at large, Li said.
1	To welcome the upcoming 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and demonstrate the essence of Chinese culture, the National Museum of China recently showcased the works of 43 masters of Chinese literature and art from the last century. Titled  the event features over 90 rare items including paintings, calligraphies, publications, manuscripts and photos. Ranging from novelists Lu Xun and Ba Jin to painters Qi Baishi and Zhang Daqian, every master from this iconic group has made significant contributions to modern Chinese culture. Most of them were born in social upheavals, grew up among the people and bore the wear and tear of the trying age, but their talent, resilience and perfectionism for arts have created the art treasures of China. Meanwhile, the National Museum also premiered  a 110-episode biographic documentary on those cultural figures on Sept 16. The first two seasons of the documentary were broadcast on China Central Television, Beijing Television and over 40 other TV stations at home and abroad. The exhibition will run through Sept 29 at the National Museum in Beijing, then tour in Shanghai, Shandong province, and Guangdong province.
0	BEIJING -- Three more urban rail sections will be put into service in Beijing this year, the Beijing Municipal Commission of Transport announced Friday. With commissioning of the subway line link to the city's new airport, the eastern extension of the existing Line 7 and Batong Line, the total length of metro rails in operation in the Chinese national capital will reach 699.3 km by the end of the year, comparing to 636.9 km at the present, according to the commission.

1	Primary and middle schools in Beijing should carry out thorough inspections of all apps, WeChat groups and QQ groups that students use, as well as the WeChat and Weibo public accounts they follow to ensure the mobile tools will not harm students' physical or psychological health. Education authorities in Beijing should submit a report on their progress to the Beijing Municipal Education Commission by March 1, the commission said on Tuesday in an online statement. Apps that contain pornography, violence, online games, commercial advertisements or that increase students' academic burdens are to be banned, it said. The content, links, functions and information security of apps should be strictly reviewed and sent for approval to higher education authorities, and unapproved apps are forbidden from use by schools. Homework and students' scores and rankings should not be shared in chat groups, and teachers should refrain from praising students or criticizing them in the groups, the statement said. Parents should not post sycophantic replies or advertisements or curry votes if their child is in the running for a prize or title, it said. Schools and education authorities should also strengthen their supervision of content and the comments on their own social media accounts. They should not post anything that is forbidden by laws or regulations, it said. On Jan 2, the Ministry of Education asked education authorities at all levels, along with middle and primary schools, to establish daily supervision to ensure that mobile apps used by the schools meet the standards set by the ministry. Schools should avoid using apps to increase the academic load for students, and educational apps used on campus are not allowed to charge money. Information should be protected and privacy leaks should be prevented, the ministry said. Xiong Bingqi, deputy head of the 21st Century Education Research Institute in Beijing, said the chat groups were originally designed as conduits of informative and harmonious dialogue between families and schools. Instead, the sheer convenience of the instant-messaging platform is becoming a cause of stress for teachers and parents alike. "The chat groups no longer play their original role, but have instead devolved into a free-for-all in which parents argue, show off and bootlick to curry favor with teachers, while the teachers feel obliged to answer questions and requests from parents 24 hours a day, seven days a week," he said. Chu Zhaohui, a senior researcher at the National Institute of Education Sciences, said that although the Beijing regulation intends to protect students from harmful content, the education authorities should refrain from going to the extreme and regulating every aspect of students' lives. "The part about teachers not recommending any social media account not managed by the school is a bit over the top, as students should have the freedom to follow any legal account they want," he said.

0	BEIJING - China has now established supervision commissions in every county, city and province as the last remaining county, Daxin in South China's Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, set up its supervision commission on Sunday. The new supervision commissions nationwide incorporate existing supervisory, corruption prevention and control agencies within the government and procuratorates and are in charge of three major duties: supervision, investigation and punishment. The new system expands the scope of inspection to ensure that all public servants who exercise public power are subject to supervision. In January 2017, China started a pilot program for the new supervision system in Beijing, as well as Shanxi and Zhejiang provinces. The number of people under supervision rose from 210,000 to 997,000 in Beijing, from 785,000 to 1.315 million in Shanxi, and from 383,000 to 701,000 in Zhejiang. Since the end of October, supervision commissions have been set up by the People's Congress at the provincial, city and county levels across the country. A supervision law is expected to pass, and the national supervision commission is expected to be formed at the first session of the 13th National People's Congress, scheduled to open on March 5.
0	When the second Beijing Documentary Week kicked off at the China Millennium Monument last week, 97-year-old translator Xu Yuanchong arrived in a wheelchair. As the first Asian winner of the Aurora Borealis prize, the world's highest honor in the field of translation, Xu is the "protagonist" of My Legacy and I: Xu Yuanchong, a documentary that opened the annual event. The documentary is part of the 10-episode TV series My Legacy and I, which recounts stories of 10 celebrities, including actor Pu Cunxin, dancer Yang Liping, artist Cai Guoqiang and Demos Chiang, a great grandson of former Kuomintang leader Chiang Kai-shek. Xu attended the premiere for a simple yet emotional reason-to see his late wife Zhao Jun again on the big screen. Zhao, who married Xu in 1959, passed away on June 15 in Beijing. In the 40-minute documentary, a series of trivial moments between the couple were captured on camera to reveal the lesser-known side of the world-renowned translator. One scene shows how he fell from his bicycle and got injured after a night of hanging out in Peking University. Even though he had to stay in hospital for two weeks, Xu depicts the fall as poetically beautiful, because the accident occurred in an alley flooded by moonlight. Held by Beijing Municipal Bureau of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television, the seven-day event runs through Thursday. Over the course of the week, nine cinemas and five art venues screened 52 acclaimed documentaries, which were selected from more than 1,000 entries. Highlights included Still Tomorrow, a biographical documentary about Chinese poet Yu Xiuhua; Chinese Heavyweight, about a boxing coach and his two students from rural China; The Verse of Us, which follows six working class poets; and Sky Ladder: The Art of Cai Guoqiang, which documents the works of the eponymous artist. Additionally, an exhibition has broadcast 40 documentaries, one produced each year from 1978 to 2018, to reflect the strides China has made, thanks to its reform and opening-up. Aside from the screenings, the event also hosted a string of forums to look into the history of documentary production in China and the future of documentaries in the digital era. Thanks to the rapid expansion of the Chinese film industry, documentary-a somewhat marginalized genre-has also seen a rise in audience interest, and with it, market share, in recent years, says Wu Wenfeng, editor-in-chief of the documentary channel on streaming service iQiyi. "Up until 2015, documentaries released online relied on pre-run advertisements to make some profit, but now viewers are willing to pay to see the content," explains Wu. However, for Zhang Zhaowei, a documentary director known for the series, Who Are Singing Their Songs Over There, budding documentary makers need to polish their skills. He suggests that they spend time reading novels or viewing art in order to hone their aesthetic taste, which he believes is an essential part of storytelling. "What happens today will become history tomorrow," says Gao Changli, director of the publicity department with the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television. "Documentaries are very important in the recording of history."

1	BEIJING -- China will start building the world's brightest synchrotron radiation light source by the end of this year in Beijing, hoping to help scientists better study the structure of microscopic particles. The High Energy Photon Source (HEPS), also called "Beijing light source" in Chinese, is expected to produce X-rays up to 300 keV in photon energy, according to the Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP) of Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), which is in charge of the development of the project. A synchrotron radiation light source is a source of electronmagnetic radiation usually produced by a storage ring. To generate light of extreme brilliance, electrons will be accelerated nearly to the speed of light in several stages and forced to travel in a closed path. Bending magnets and insertion devices in the storage ring will supply the strong magnetic fields to help convert high energy electrons into photons with high brilliance. Construction of the HEPS will be finished in six and a half years and its first phase will cover about 65 hectares in Beijing's suburban Huairou district. It will consist of accelerator chains, 14 beamlines and other auxiliary facilities. The accelerator chains include a linear accelerator, a booster and a gigantic storage ring with a circumference up to about 1,360 meters. The storage ring is considered key to the generation of "brightest light," as it will effectively lower the emittance down to 60 pm rad or lower, according to a scientific paper published in Chinese Physics C. The lower the emittance, the brighter the synchrotron light. "The emittance is minimized to enable many more photons of a given direction to be concentrated on a spot per unit of time, which will determine the light brilliance," explained Xu Gang, the paper's first author. The X-rays produced by such a light source will help open a new door in observing and studying matter at the micrometer to nanometer level, Xu said. Scientists use different light to study different things. For example, they observe stars with radio waves, follow airplanes with microwaves, and study very small objects, like viruses, protein molecules and metal atoms, with the light that is close to the size of these particles in wavelength. "How does a blood cell flow in a vessel? How does a scientific device at the nanometer level work? How do we inject and extract lithium ions from batteries? All the studies rely on light with extremely short wavelengths, or in other words, extremely bright light," said Ding Hong, a researcher in the Institute of Physics of CAS. In the future, HEPS will serve as a research platform for material science, chemical engineering, biomedicine and other fields.
0	BEIJING - Ma was travelling from Beijing to Guangzhou on a high speed train and enjoying freshly-cooked spicy fish head and stewed pork, typical cuisines of his hometown in Hunan province. "All I did was to take out my phone and make an order, and the meal was served upon the train's arrival [at Changsha station in Hunan]," said Ma."I'm so glad to have a taste of my home on this long and tiring journey." China is in the midst of its travel rush for Chinese New Year, the most important time of the year for Chinese families to get together. Around 2.98 billion trips are expected to be made during the 40 days starting Feb. 1 around the festival, including 390 million trips by train, up 8.8 percent on last year. With their smartphones, Chinese people on trains will no longer have to eat instant noodles, ham, sausages and box meals, as food delivery services have gone aboard high-speed trains. From July 2017, 27 major railway stations across China launched a pilot on-demand food delivery service for high-speed trains passing through the stations. Meal upgrades are not the only progress brought by smartphones during the travel rush. At waiting rooms of Beijing Railway Station, passengers waiting for their trains can be found shaking their smartphones. Within seconds, a service webpage shows up on their screens, with the train schedule, wheelchair leasing, and lost and found services available. The software imbedded in the social networking app WeChat can also lead passengers to the right waiting room. "The smartphone service has saved passengers from turning to a station worker for help and improved efficiency for our services," said Ma Jianfu, a publicity manager at Beijing Railway Station. At Beijing West Railway Station, railway workers have applied for facial recognition for ticket checks. The gate allows passengers to pass through automatically if their faces are recognized as the same as pictures on their ID cards. "It needs only three to five seconds for each passenger to enter," said Song Tingting, with the station. According to the China Railway Corporation, 70 to 80 percent of train tickets are sold online, with nearly 10 million tickets sold at most in a day. Ma from Beijing Railway Station said that technology has helped improve railway services. "In an era with explosive information technology and ubiquitous smartphones, railway workers need to keep pace with society and better serve passengers during the travel rush," he said.
0	Defendants in more than 95 percent of official misconduct cases heard by a Beijing court over the past two decades were charged with bribery, corruption or embezzlement, according to a report released Wednesday. The anti-graft report, issued by the Beijing No 1 Intermediate People's Court, looked at cases heard since 1995, when it was established, with the aim of strengthening the fight against corruption and giving a warning to officials. The report said the court has concluded 1,802 official misconduct cases, of which 1,724 ¡ª or 95.7 percent ¡ª involved charges of bribery, corruption or embezzlement. Half the defendants were sentenced to at least 10 years in prison, while the amount of money involved in more than 46 percent of cases exceeded 1 million yuan ($143,548), it said. The court in western Beijing, where many government departments, colleges and financial institutions are located, has heard several high-profile cases involving officials at ministerial level or above. It sentenced Cheng Kejie, former vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, to death for bribery in 2000. Cheng was the highest-level official given the death penalty for corruption since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. In 2007, the court sentenced to death Zheng Xiaoyu, former director of the China Food and Drug Administration, for accepting 6.49 million yuan in bribes and dereliction of duty. The nation's central leadership has stepped up the fight against corrupt officials in recent years. The court said it would continue to strictly punish people convicted in such cases, and explain related laws and the negative effects of such crimes through its rulings.
0	China's first guideline on road tests of autonomous motor vehicles was released on Monday by local authorities in Beijing, signaling the country's determination to accelerate the development of the technology. The guideline, compiled by the city's transport commission, public security bureau and economy and information technology commission, applies to independent entities registered in China. They can apply to test at most five vehicles at a time, but before conducting road tests they must first complete tests in designated closed zones, according to the guideline. It also requires that a human driver sit in the driver's seat to be able to immediately take over the car in case of emergencies and other special situations. The authorities said they will soon release the list of road sections eligible for such tests. John Zeng, managing director of the consulting firm LMC Automotive Shanghai, said the guideline is very helpful to companies in the sector, many of which are testing autonomous driving in the United States. "It's a practical move that will greatly promote the sector. It will be even more helpful if there is a national-level guideline," said Zeng. The guideline came four days after the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology unveiled a three-year plan to boost the application of artificial intelligence in automotive and other sectors. Under the plan, by 2020 the nation will build a reliable and safe platform for smart and internet-connected vehicles that can support highly autonomous driving technologies. China expects 80 percent of new vehicles sold in 2025 to feature some autonomous driving functions, according to an automotive development plan released in April. Many Chinese companies, including Baidu Inc, are already working hard on the research and development of autonomous driving technology. Baidu also plans to introduce vehicles that will allow drivers to take their eyes off the road in 2019 in cooperation with Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Co and Beijing Automotive Group Co. PwC's consultancy subsidiary Strategy& estimated that by 2030, China will have at least 33 million highly or fully autonomous driving vehicles, more than those in the US or the EU.
0	China's environmental authority found 248 companies in violation of standards during the latest round of air pollution inspection, of which over 100 were found to have discharged pollutants excessively.  Inspection teams in 28 cities in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and nearby provinces of Henan, Shandong and Shanxi have inspected 396 companies, of which 248 were found breaking the rules, the Ministry of Environmental Protection said in a statement on Thursday night.  The ministry launched the largest-ever inspection on the northern region to control air pollution, with a first group of more than 220 inspectors visiting the 28 cities since April 8. It released its findings on violations each day.  Most recently, the ministry's inspectors found a limestone factory in Beijing's Shunyi district did not have pollution control facilities and seemed to have used some machines that had already been sealed by local authorities, inspectors found.  In Tianjin, a wooden door maker was operating with neither environmental permission nor pollution controls.  The inspectors have reported the problems to local authorities for further investigation, the statement said.
