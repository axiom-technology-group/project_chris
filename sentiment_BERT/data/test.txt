{"content": "The chance of getting a new car registration in Beijing reached a record low this month because of an increase in applicants for the license plate lottery, combined with a reduced quota. According to data from the capital's Transport Commission, more than 2.8 million applicants participated in the lottery on Monday to get a license for a conventional car in Beijing. The government gave out 6,333 licenses in the lottery, which meant the chance was 1 in 2,031 - slightly worse odds than for the lottery in April, which was 1 in 1,963. Li Bin, 33, an IT engineer who has participated in the lottery for five years, said the success rate made no difference to him. \"No matter whether it's 1 in 2,031 or 1 in 1,963, it means nothing to me,\" he said. \"I don't think I can get a plate anytime soon. So, I applied for a new energy vehicle license and gave up trying for a gas or diesel car, even though I really love driving a gas car.\" Not that it is much easier to get a license for an electric car. According to data from the commission, about 280,000 people have applied for licenses for e-vehicles in Beijing, which means new applicants will be eligible in 2024 at the earliest. During Monday's lottery, 4,135 people who failed to comply with court orders were barred from entering, a practice that started in April, when 4,017 defaulters were barred. The capital introduced an annual quota for new car registrations in 2011 to ease traffic congestion and combat smog. For the past two years, the cap has been set at 90,000 licenses for conventional vehicles, available only by entering a monthly draw, and 60,000 for new energy vehicles, which are distributed on a first-come, first-served basis. The municipal government has cut the quota for gas and diesel cars by more than half to 40,000, an attempt to control the growing number of cars on the road. Rong Jun, spokesman for the Beijing Transport Commission, said the lottery policy is far from perfect, but it's needed under the circumstances, since Beijing's population and demand for cars have surpassed the city's capacity. Beijing aims to keep the total number of cars below 6.3 million until 2020. As of the end of 2017, the city had about 5.9 million cars. In 2011, when the lottery policy was launched, the number was around 4.98 million.", "overall-label": "politics"}

{"content": "BEIJING - With dignitaries flocking to the Swiss resort of Davos from every corner of the globe, the World Economic Forum (WEF) offers a once-a-year opportunity for the international community to debate on how to forge ahead with plans to revive global economy. The theme of this year's economic jamboree - \"Creating a Shared Future in a Fractured World\" - echoes Chinese President Xi Jinping's vision of \"Building a Community with a Shared Future for Mankind.\" Scholars and political figures consider the vision as a guide for the world to pursue future economic development to achieve common prosperity. Michael Moller, director general of the UN Office at Geneva, said this year's WEF theme has \"an organic\" link to what Xi said. \"It was a new movement and new positioning of China that was extremely welcome at the time when the world was fragmented, when we had many problems of different kinds,\" he said. \"The rest of the world is coming to follow the president's words last year,\" he said. \"We are seeing more and more renewed international solidarity.\" According to British scholar Martin Jacques, a professor at University of Cambridge, China has provided a new possibility, that is, abandoning the law of the jungle, hegemonism and power politics and the zero-sum game and replacing them with win-win cooperation and co-construction and sharing. This is unprecedented pioneering work and a great creation to change the world. Peter Thomson, president of the 71st session of the UN General Assembly, said building a community with a shared future for mankind \"to me is the only future for humanity on this planet.\" Xi made a keynote speech entitled   at WEF one year ago. The speech pointed out that in the face of both opportunities and challenges of economic globalization, the right thing to do is to seize every opportunity, jointly meet challenges and chart the right course for economic globalization. \"We should commit ourselves to growing an open global economy to share opportunities and interests through opening-up and achieve win-win outcomes,\" Xi said. One day after he made the WEF speech, Xi spoke to an audience at the UN Geneva Office, elaborating his ideas of building a community with a shared future for mankind. \"We should build an open and inclusive world through exchanges and mutual learning,\" Xi said. \"We should make our world clean and beautiful by pursuing green and low-carbon development.\" Moller said he had recommended that many people read these two speeches made by President Xi, according to People's Daily, the official newspaper of the Communist Party of China (CPC). He said the messages contained in the two speeches have clearly presented the world the policy direction of the Chinese government, which means a huge step towards the common goals set by the world. This year at WEF in Davos, Liu He, a senior Chinese official, elaborated the top-level planning of China's economic policy for the next few years. Liu, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and director of the General Office of the Central Leading Group for Financial and Economic Affairs, pledged that China will open wider to the world. In his speech, Liu stressed the necessity to shift the Chinese economy from a phase of rapid growth to one of high-quality development. Such a transition, he said, is the context in which China formulates its macroeconomic, structural, reform and social policies in the coming years. He said China will further integrate with international trade rules and ease market access. China will also substantially open up the services sector, the financial sector in particular, and create a more attractive investment environment. Over the past year, China has also been working hard to turn the vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind into actions. In May, 2017, China hosted the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation to expand the circle of friends for the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative. Over 100 countries and international development organizations including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund participated in the forum in Beijing. The Leaders Roundtable of the forum produced a communique which strongly denounced protectionism, saying \"we endeavor to promote a universal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system with WTO at its core.\" In September, China hosted the ninth BRICS summit in the southeastern city of Xiamen, Fujian province. A declaration issued following the meetings of the five major emerging economies - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, said: \"We emphasize the importance of an open and inclusive world economy enabling all countries and peoples to share the benefits of globalization.\" Moreover, the 19th CPC National Congress, held in Beijing in October, set building a community with a shared future for mankind and building a new type of international relations as an overall goal of China's diplomacy. These endeavors initiated by China have once again demonstrated China's commitment to building an open economy, ensuring free and inclusive trade worldwide and sharing benefits with other countries.", "overall-label": "business"}

{"content": "  Indian and Chinese artists get together to present a piece inspired by classical kathak and modern dance in Beijing, Chen Nan reports.  She spins around and around really fast with her long, black braided hair spinning in the air and her hands gesturing up and down.  \"It's all about the center point. All the movements start and return to the center point of the body,\" gasps Mitul Sengupta, a 35-year-old Indian dancer-choreographer, who displays a movement of kathak, a major Indian classical dance form, at the theater of Beijing Dance/LDTX.  This is part of her latest choreography work, titled  which will be staged at Beijing's Tianqiao Performing Arts Center on Friday and will travel to Taiyuan in Shanxi province on Monday.  The work is the first collaborative project between Rhythmosaic-Sengupta Dance Company, which was founded by Sengupta 10 years ago along with her husband, Ronnie Shambik Ghose, who graduated from the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts with a major in musical theater dance, and Beijing Dance/LDTX, which was founded by Willy Tsao in 2005.  Choreographed by the couple, Tsao and Ma Bo, the latter a veteran dancer of Beijing Dance/LDTX,   features more than 20 dancers from China and India. The music contains traditional instruments of both countries, such as the sitar and   (Chinese zither).  The costumes feature white and black not only to match the title of the work, but also to express the vibrancy of other colors through contrast, such as yellow and green, which was the idea of the participating Indian artists.  When it premiered at Calcutta Club, a well-known heritage venue in the Indian city of Kolkata, in December 2015,  was staged five times, drawing more than 5,000 people.  \"The response of the audience was fantastic. This is a production to strengthen the bond and cultural heritage of the two ancient countries, which share lots of similarities and a long history of friendship,\" says Oindrilla Dutt, the curator and initiator of the project.  She named the dance work   to symbolize \"peace, unity and the flowing of time\".  Dutt, who is an experienced curator of the arts, got to know Sengupta and Ghose about a decade ago and offered them their first break onstage in India.  \"Sengupta has had strong training in Indian classical dance from a very young age and Ghose has been trained in jazz, classical ballet and modern dance,\" Dutt says, adding that the couple are open to fusion of traditional and contemporary dance moves, which made their experiment with a Chinese modern dance company possible.  In 2014, Dutt came to Beijing along with the couple and dancers from the Rhythmosaic-Sengupta Dance Company to perform at the Beijing Dance Festival, an annual event launched by Tsao in 2008 to promote modern dance in the Chinese capital by bringing international contemporary dance troupes here as well as showcasing local talents.  According to Sengupta, it was her company's first trip to China and the first time for an Indian dance company to perform at the festival. The program they presented was titled Desolate - The Voices of the Trapped, which blends kathak with contemporary dance.  \"We were impressed by the young Chinese dancers' techniques and along with Willy Tsao, we developed the idea of producing a dance piece to celebrate the diversity of both countries, which is based on the languages of kathak and contemporary dance forms,\" says Sengupta.  In 2012, the couple worked with French dancer-choreographer Gianin Loringett, giving a modern twist to Tchaikovsky's classic ballet, Swan Lake. Titled Swan Lake Revisited, the work was a fusion of classical ballet and kathak.  \"Like technology keeps progressing, modern dance also develops fast, and one of the most important factors is to learn and be inspired from a different culture,\" says Tsao who runs three major modern dance companies in China.  \"This collaboration opens our vision for modern dance. These artists showed us that Indian dance can be both very traditional and very modern.\"  Calling the experience both challenging and rewarding, Dutt says dance is universal, which is all about breaking down barriers.  \"This is an exciting time to be an artist. In the past, there was a strong division of different forms of arts, but now artists can combine the arts together for independent expression,\" says Dutt.     ", "overall-label": "life-style"}

If approved, the rule would make Qinhuangdao the first city to ban smoking on beaches. Drafted by the city's health commission, the regulation would also ban smoking in all indoor public spaces, workplaces and public transportation vehicles, as well as in some outdoor public areas, including scenic areas and near children's hospitals, schools and libraries. E-cigarettes would also be prohibited. The draft has been released on the city's website to solicit public opinion. \"By including beaches in the spaces where smoking is banned, we can set a standard for other coastal cities to follow,\" Liao Wenke, deputy director of the Chinese Association on Tobacco Control, was quoted as saying by china.caixin.com. Banning smoking on beaches is an international trend, according to an article on the association's website. It said Thailand, a popular destination for coastal tourism, initiated smoking bans on its 24 beaches in February last year. Wang Na, a 31-year-old from Qinhuangdao who has a 3-year-old daughter, said the smoke-free environment will encourage her to spend weekends with her family on the beaches more often. \"I don't like the smell of cigarettes and hate to let my daughter be exposed to it,\" Wang said, adding that she often sees discarded cigarette butts on the sand.

Since Beijing won its bid to host the 2022 Winter Olympics in 2015, the Beijing-based China Tourism Academy reports that the country's winter tourism business has taken off. Chinese travelers made approximately 197 million visits to venues and locations offering cold weather activities during the winter of 2017-18, a year-on-year increase of 16 percent, the Academy's report shows. During that same period, winter tourism generated revenues of about 330 billion yuan ($47.9 billion), up 22 percent year-on-year. Travelers are also increasingly spending more time at their winter destinations, with trips lasting, on average, about three days during the 2017-18 winter period. Skiing is the most popular activity, with ski resorts accounting for 60 percent of the market nationwide.

Free and discounted tickets to major scenic spots in Gansu will be offered during the winter period until the end of March, and top-rated restaurants are also offering preferential rates.,In Xinjiang, at a winter-tourism festival in the region's capital, Urumqi, and a winter-industry expo in Altay, more than 130 tourism activities have been staged since Oct 14, many of which will also continue through March. Travelers can explore the wilderness on a horse-drawn sleigh or by helicopter at the Altay Mountain Wild Snow Park, while hot air balloon flights, ethnic Kazak folk performances and rime festivals in Koktokay. Rime is white ice that forms when water droplets in fog freeze to the outer surfaces of objects, such as trees and is feathery and milky in appearance, creating stunning scenery. Urumqi's ancient ecology park offers opportunities for horse riders to engage with the region's equestrian culture during holidays like Spring Festival, which falls on Feb 5, and Valentine's Day, nine days later. At the same time, Xinjiang has adopted about 100 new policies to boost winter tourism. Free and discounted skiing and dining tickets will be offered at Urumqi's 20-day snow-art carnival which takes place around Spring Festival. Gifts and Xinjiang specialties at an \"agritainment\" food competition and hiking event around the capital's Grand Bazaar will be prepared, while top-grade scenic spots will offer lower winter ticket prices through March. Chartered-plane and tourism-train passengers will receive monetary incentives, as will travel agencies that bring large numbers of visitors during the winter. Heilongjiang province has also upgraded its winter tourism packages and offers custom-made tours and interactive programs. More than 300 events featuring folk celebrations and winter sports, as well more than 4,000 art performances are part of a program that runs through April, according to Zhang Lina, head of the Heilongjiang culture and tourism authority. The capital city and future host of the Winter Olympics, Beijing, as you would expect, is keen to raise the profile of winter travel and get in on the action. Therefore, it has also launched 15 tourism packages and dozens of self-drive routes to provide plenty of winter fun for local residents and tourists. The packages cover activities across a range of interests, including folk customs, winter sports, traditional Chinese medicine, hot springs, shopping and art performances.,The goal is to encourage people to experience the winter charm of the capital and popularize winter sports ahead of the 2022 winter games, says Wang Yue, deputy head of the Beijing culture and tourism authority. She says that temple visits, museum exhibitions and special park and library events would also be held during the Spring Festival. All of these are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the country's brisk development of its winter travel business. Investment in winter tourism has reached approximately 540 billion yuan during 2017-18, according to China Tourism Academy. According to UNWTO forecasts, the output value of relevant sectors, including winter sports, resorts and exhibitions, are expected to hit 2.92 trillion yuan during the 2021-22 season. Governments at various levels have increased infrastructure construction in winter destinations. The new terminal at Changchun Airport, Beijing-Zhangjiakou high-speed rail and Altay Airport have all given travelers easier access to the nation's winter wonderlands. The improving domestic winter tourism infrastructure has also turned some regions into snowcapped hot spots, says Chinese travel website Mafengwo. The ski resorts at Mount Emei and Xiling Snow Mountain have made Sichuan province a popular winter getaway, while Hubei, Zhejiang, Guizhou and Hunan provinces have all built their own winter tourism sites. Despite cold weather activities being relatively more expensive, more tourists are willing to pay for better experiences and domestic winter tourism spending broke 3,000 yuan per capita, Tuniu reports. In 2018, the purchase of ski equipment grew by 90 percent year-on-year, according to online retail platform, Tmall. \"Experiencing high-quality winter tourism will be an important theme this winter,\" Feng Rao, a senior official with Mafengwo's tourism research center, told China Tourism News. The winter tourism market is offering travelers more quality choices, she explains. \"With a series of positive supervision and standardization work by relevant departments across the country, this year's market environment and tourism services are expected to improve significantly,\" says Feng.", "overall-label": "life-style"}

{"content": "  Chinese internet and mobile app publisher Cheetah Mobile Inc is stepping up efforts to expand its presence in overseas countries by upgrading its products and services with artificial intelligence technologies.  Fu Sheng, CEO of the Beijing-based company, said it is very important to have abundant application scenarios and a large number of users to achieve breakthroughs in AI and this is exactly in line with the company's edge.  By applying image recognition technologies to Live.me, a live streaming platform which is ranked as the most popular social-networking app on Google Play app store in the United States, the company said it can now automatically track user-generated content. The move has greatly boosted work efficiency and lowered labor costs.  Cheetah Mobile has also invested $400 million into an AI startup called Beijing Orion Star Technology Co Ltd, in a move to beef up its technology prowess.  Unlike the first-wave of Chinese internet players such as Baidu Inc and Tencent Holdings Ltd which rely on the domestic market to thrive, Cheetah Mobile gets 75.4 percent of its nearly 600 million monthly active users from abroad. The firm has managed to achieve that within just six years.  The Beijing-based company started to zero in on overseas markets after competition in the domestic market intensified in 2012. It worked hard to adapt itself to foreign markets.  \"Our strategy is straight-forward: develop utility apps, which are hardly subject to cultural influences and enjoy universal, steady demand,\" Chen Bo, a software developer at Cheetah said.  The Beijing-based company quickly gained a presence by rolling out Clean Master, the Android junk cleaning app, and CM Security, which protects smartphones with anti-virus software and privacy.  But unexpectedly, cultural obstacles still popped up. \"Users in the Middle East complained against an ad on our app because the girls on that ad wore off-shoulder tops,\" Chen said. \"We then worked hard to localize our apps as per overseas sensibilities.\"  Cheetah Mobile found advertisement revenue hard to come by as users generally don't use e-tools and apps of the kind it develops every day. As a result it has been transforming itself into a content business through research and acquisitions.  \"Apps that provide content and services, such as social media apps, live streaming apps, maps, mobile payments apps and online shopping apps have become the new trend for Chinese developers who are targeting emerging and developed markets,\" said Wei Fangdan, CEO of Baijingapp, an online community of more than 40,000 domestic app developers who have global aspirations.  In the third quarter of this year, Cheetah Mobile generated 154 million yuan ($23.4 million) in operating profit, marking a 303 percent year-on-year growth.", "overall-label": "tech"}

The 47-year-old is an inheritor of the Cheng school - one of four major Peking Opera styles founded by late opera master Cheng Yanqiu (1904-58) that emerged in the early 20th century. Though the 200-year-old art form has gradually lost its appeal to the general public in modern society, Zhang has performed sold-out shows both in and outside China, attracting audiences of all ages. Starting in 2008, however, she took an academic approach to pass down the traditional art. For 10 years, she has been teaching at the National Academy of Chinese Theater Arts in Beijing, a leading school for traditional Chinese opera.

{"content": "   While patriotic education is still considered highly important, some patriotic education centers, which aim to raise awareness through a range of activities, face problems.   Although they are crowded on special dates, some education centers receive very few visitors at other times.   One such example is the Li Dazhao Martyrs Cemetery in northwest Beijing, where Li, one of the founders of the Communist Party of China, is buried. It was listed as a national patriotic education center in 2001.   Guan Xiaolin, a security guard who has worked at the cemetery for three years, said that the record number of visitors, in his memory, was about 3,000, when a group of soldiers visited on a special day.   \"Apart from occasions like that, the place is extremely quiet for most of the year, just as you see now - there's not even a single visitor,\" he said.   Other centers are experiencing similar situations.   One example is the former residence of Soong Ching Ling, the honorary chairwoman of the People's Republic of China in the 20th century, located near Houhai Lake in Beijing's downtown.   It was Soong's home from 1963 to 1981, and is now a patriotic education center.   \"Mostly people come to visit on certain memorial days, such as National Day on Oct 1 and the anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, which falls on July 1. Most visitors come in groups rather than individuals,\" said a 65-year-old volunteer at the residence, who asked only to be identified by her surname, Gao.   She added that the visitors vary greatly in age, and most come in the name of social groups or Party committees from across the country.   \"But the number of individual visitors has risen a lot compared with years ago, thanks to the country's improved patriotic education in recent years and the official website of the residence, where visitors can access exhibition information,\" she said.   According to Beijing Daily, more than 200,000 visitors visited the residence last year, and the official website of the residence says it received an average of nearly 2,500 visitors a day during the seven-day National Day holiday last year.   In addition, some patriotic education centers fail to meet visitors' expectations because they lack diverse displays and exhibitions.   Tursongul Torgan, a primary school teacher from the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region in Northwest China, visited Soong's former residence soon after she arrived in Beijing with colleagues for a period of training in late September.   She said young people, especially children and teenagers, quickly become bored with exhibitions and listening to guides.   \"Based on my experience, most children around me don't enjoy just reading information boards. They prefer modern displays, which they find more interesting,\" she added.   Sun Lu, a teacher of Chinese at Hefei No 42 Middle School in East China's Anhui province, said many patriotic education centers still display the history in dull ways, and are failing to keep pace with the times.   \"Those centers should provide better services by utilizing modern technologies, such as VR glasses and 4-D films, which will not only attract the attention of teenagers, but also adults,\" she said.

{"content": "Tianjin will give top priority to industrial restructuring as part of the ongoing efforts by the northern port city to sustain annual GDP growth. Tianjin's renewed focus came after its GDP growth fell to 3.6 percent last year from double-digit growth in the preceding years. During the first six months of this year, the city's GDP edged up by 1.5 percentage points compared with the first quarter, growing 3.4 percent to reach 992.7 billion yuan ($145.7 billion), showing signs of a slight recovery. Decluttering Beijing's industries and trying to transfer competitive sectors including intelligent sectors, part of the efforts to implement the synergic development strategy for Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei province, is now a key effort to restructure Tianjin's industrial layout. The effort is expected to pay off to help reverse Tianjin's downward GDP and the city revealed an ambitious target to build itself into an \"intelligent coastal port\", said Sun Hujun, deputy head of Tianjin Municipal Development and Reform Commission. A prime example is the Tianjin Economic and Technological Development Area (TEDA), which has attracted 238 Beijing companies during the first half with contractual investment value of up to 74.2 billion yuan. According to Zheng Weiming, director of the administrative committee of TEDA, the area is highly \"selective\" in its industrial transfer campaign as it wants to ensure quality GDP growth. As a result, most of the firms in the area are from central State-owned companies, and also include emerging intelligence projects from JD and Baidu. Zheng, however, admitted that, despite the selective approach, the area logged the highest GDP growth in the city of 7.3 percent. Liu Gang, director of Economic Research Institute at Nankai University in Tianjin, indicated that the city s' previous economy was highly dependent on investment and heavy industries. But it needs to move on to a new path driven by smart technology upgrading, he added. \"China has strong demand to boost intelligent industries and Tianjin can cater to the demand by helping move industries from Beijing,\" he said. To this end, the city unveiled a package of polices in mid-June, ranging from enterprises' smart upgrading, cutting-edge internet transformation, as well as development in robotics, integrated circuit, software, information services to big data sectors. Each relevant project could hit up to 50 million yuan and there are no limits for eligible companies to seek funding.", "overall-label": "business"}

Yanqing, 74 kilometers northwest of central Beijing, will host several events, including Alpine skiing, bobsled, skeleton and luge. So far, up to 14,000 students in the district have taken skating and skiing lessons, said Zheng Shiyong, deputy director of Yanqing district's education commission. \"We will continue supporting and encouraging more people to participate in winter sports,\" he said, adding that around 17,000 students will experience winter activities by the end of this year. Some professional winter sports activities have also been designed into the district's education plans, with more professional instruction to students, according to Zheng. The district's education authorities also cooperated with its sports bureau to make winter ice and snow sports available to all residents in the area. \"We will have 110,000 people participating in winter ice and snow activities by 2022 in Yanqing,\" said Ma Zhiyong, deputy director of the sports bureau. So far, more than 47,000 people have received skating and skiing training and the number will continue to rise, with expectations of 70,000 enrolled by the end of this year, he added. He also said Yanqing has built more ski runs over the last two years, based on seasonal features and site conditions. Some important events and testing activities are expected to be held in Yanqing - for example, the 14th National Winter Games Alpine skiing speed events in 2020. Zheng, the deputy commissioner, said schools in Yanqing also created some outdoor ice rinks when winter weather conditions allowed, while in summer, manmade ice would be a good choice for campuses to open up skating practice. Yanqing will put more effort into increasing the number of qualified winter sports instructors, improving school curriculum and hastening construction of winter sports venues to add more flavor to the upcoming Winter Olympics in China, he said.", "overall-label": "life-style"}
{"content": "Topographically treacherous Guiyang has used innovation to transform its geological disadvantages into advantages, especially during the most recent stage of reform and opening-up. Its mountains have proved to be development hurdles, sometimes literally, in areas such as transportation infrastructure. Yet that very geology is now proving to be a boon rather than a bane for the development of Guiyang and surrounding areas in Guizhou province. That is because it is seismically stable, and its altitudes produce relatively steady, cool temperatures year-round, which makes it ideal for big data infrastructure. Guizhou's data economy grew by 37 percent last year, and its value addition is expected to account for 30 percent of the province's GDP by 2020. Guiyang has ranked No 1 among provincial capitals in GDP growth for the past five years. Its GDP reached 353.8 billion yuan ($50.9 billion) last year, about 79 times the 1978 figure based on comparable prices, with annual growth averaging 12.3 percent over the past four decades. The city's big data is transforming sectors such as agriculture, healthcare and transport cargo across the province, country and world. Truck driver Gao Dabao said big data collection in Guiyang has changed his life through a single app - Huochebang. He used to find work by driving around shipping centers throughout the country, looking at lists hung on lobby walls to see what goods were being sent when and where, and for what price. \"It was inconvenient and tiring,\" Gao said. \"Now, I just search Huochebang to find cargo to drive. It's easy.\" Based in Guiyang, Huochebang is the country's largest shipment information internet platform. It links 5.2 million trucks with 1.25 million users - businesses and individuals - who want cargo transported. \"Our main target is to solve problems in the informatization of truck and cargo matching,\" said Zhao Qiang, vice-president of Huochebang. \"This can lower logistics costs, which benefits all of society. \"We've grown rapidly since we arrived in Guizhou in 2014, when big data was booming. Big data helps us understand more about such areas as trucks and human behaviors. So it empowers the industry.\" Big data also enables the establishment of credit systems and conflict mediation, he said, adding: \"There were often disagreements due to a lack of credibility. Drivers are graded according to big data. That can extend to loans.\" In the past four years, Huochebang has grown from a small acorn into a unicorn, a startup valued at $1 billion. \"The market for truck drivers is huge - so huge that it'll be worth more than 1 trillion yuan in the near future,\" Luo Peng, vice-president of Manbang Group, which owns Huochebang, said in June. \"The domestic logistics supply is very fragmented. China now has around 1.5 million logistics companies and tens of millions of truckers. As an industrial internet platform, we need to ramp up resources to better serve the drivers via emerging technologies such as big data and artificial intelligence.\" Guiyang ranks in the top 10 Chinese cities for computing power, according to the 2018 China AI Computing Power Development Report released at the 2018 AI Computing Conference in Beijing in September. Industry investment has increased tenfold in the past year, while the computing power of artificial intelligence has grown by 230 percent and the amount of data has expanded by 50 percent. Big tech giants such as Apple, Qualcomm, Huawei, Tencent, Alibaba and Foxconn have regional headquarters in the city as well as cloud-computing and big data centers. Per capita disposable income in Guiyang's urban area was 32,186 yuan last year, up by 11.9 times in real terms compared with that of 1980, with annual growth averaging about 7.2 percent. The figure for rural areas was 14,264 yuan, 12.2 times more than in 1980 in real terms, with an annual average growth of about 7.2 percent.

{"content": "At a recent exhibition at the Beijing University of Technology, 21-year-old Polish student Oskar Czajkowsk introduced his graphic design work, the pattern of which, seen from a distance, looks like two interlocking and opposing Cs. The work, on closer inspection, appears less symmetrical as the upper ends of the Cs differ from each other in shape\u00a3\u00adone looks like the beak of a raptor and the other, the head of a dragon. \"The white-tailed eagle in the Polish emblem is regarded as the symbol of our country. And I learned that the Chinese usually identify themselves as 'the descendants of the dragon',\" says Czajkowsk, who studies at the Poznan University of Technology. \"I portrayed the intertwining eagle and dragon to represent the close relationship between the two countries.\" His work was in the running to be chosen as the logo for the Sino-Polish University Consortium Under the Belt and Road Initiative, which was founded in March 2017. It won the second prize in the first art-and-design competition held by the consortium. The exhibition displays some 200 of the winning designs out of the 900 works in the competition. The consortium comprises 15 Chinese universities, including BJUT, Beijing International Studies University, Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture, and Chongqing University, as well as 12 universities from Poland, such as the Opole University of Technology and the Poznan University of Technology.,The consortium aims to facilitate cooperation in higher education between the two countries and create a bond by organizing various activities, such as the exhibition. This time, the competition attracted participants from 31 universities and institutes in China, Poland, Ukraine, South Korea and Estonia with nearly 900 entries covering logo design, crafts, painting, photography, costume design and digital media. Entries were required to show either the history, culture, art or technology of China or of the participants' countries. Chen Lizhong, a postgraduate student from BJUT's school of art and design, prepared for the competition for many months. He was not only a contestant but also among the designers of the brochure, the main illustration and the cloth bags used in the event.,\"The national flags of China and Poland feature the color red. So we used red in the main illustration. We wanted all the visual elements of the event to show the characteristics of both countries,\" says the 26-year-old, adding that he had to learn about Polish culture. Chen's schoolmate, 23-year-old Song Peng, was familiar with Polish arts and crafts as her teacher had once suggested that she design tableware based on the culture of the European country. Song then used the stylistic pattern on Polish pottery as the inspiration of her design. She says: \"I tried to distill the cultural messages into a representative image of Polish culture and then made a series of products embodying the core images.\" For this competition, she created jewelry based on images related to a poem in the Chinese classic, The Book of Songs, and won a prize. Wu Bin, vice-president of BJUT, says an art and design competition is more inclusive than an academic event, as it allows students from various educational backgrounds to join in and broaden their horizons. Besides, Wu says: \"I hope that through promoting mutual learning and understanding between BJUT and Polish universities, our art-and-design discipline could be further developed and meet international standards. \"Next year, we will take the competition to Poland.\" Wojciech Zajaczkowski, the Polish ambassador to China, who attended the opening ceremony of the exhibition, supports the idea. And he hopes that the competition will become a source of inspiration for students from both countries. Speaking about the contestants, Wu Xing, deputy director of BJUT's school of art and design, says most of the contestants were from engineering universities whose strengths are not in art and design, but it was a good chance for them to improve these abilities. \"The contest also helped to inspire the students to develop their artistic skills and promote interdisciplinary studies.\",He adds that schools of art and design in engineering universities will only stand out when they find ways to learn from such majors as mechanical engineering and software. Meanwhile, BJUT is running workshops on Chinese painting and calligraphy, traditional tie-dyeing techniques and shadow plays for visiting Polish students after the competition. Polish student Dorota Wozniak says she found similarities between the two cultures. \"We both have exquisite porcelain and traditional paper craftwork,\" she says. \"But there are more cultural similarities for me to discover.

{"content": "China will lift foreign ownership restrictions in the life insurance sector in three years and raise foreign ownership limits to 51 percent in joint-venture life insurance firms by the end of June, a top regulatory official said. Speaking at a panel discussion during the Boao Forum for Asia on Wednesday, Yi Gang, the governor of the People's Bank of China, the central bank, said the new measures will form part of the broader package of policies that will further open up the country's financial sector. Industry insiders said the new measures will instill market vitality and create new development opportunities. By June 30 this year, most of the measures will be in place, Yi said, the first time that China has provided a clear timeline on its financial market opening-up plans since the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China last October. Wang Guojun, an insurance professor at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, said the new measures are well within expectations. \"The change in the foreign ownership ceiling in a joint venture life insurer from the previous 50 percent to 51 percent is very important and can help reduce internal rivalries,\" said Wang. Chen Liang, CEO of Allianz China Life, welcomed the latest round of opening-up measures. \"The central government's latest efforts will benefit the whole insurance industry. A more open and fully-competitive market will not only bring new development opportunities for Allianz and other foreign insurers, but also bring lots of benefits for Chinese customers,\" said Chen. Being the first European insurer entering the Chinese market, Allianz has been operating in the country for 19 years and has developed a full line of businesses including life insurance, property and casualty insurance and asset management. \"We believe we can play a bigger role in better serving Chinese customers, especially in the fields of pension business and health insurance sectors,\" Chen added. \"And we are looking forward to more supportive regulatory policies that encourage product innovation.\" Statistics from the banking and insurance regulator showed that foreign life insurers' market share in China stood at around 5.8 percent by the end of last year. But their market share in the country's metropolitan cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou has been close to 20 percent. Besides, qualified foreign investors are also allowed to run insurance agencies and survey and loss adjustment businesses in China. Foreign brokers will also enjoy the same business scope like their Chinese counterparts. Shen Kaitao, chairman of Jiang Tai Insurance Brokers Co Ltd, one of the country's largest insurance brokers, said such measures will help to improve the efficiency of the whole industry with more competition in the market. \"With years of development, Chinese insurance brokers have gained rich experience in dealing with SMEs and individuals.

{"content": "The world premiere of an English-language musical version of   will be staged in Beijing from Nov 30 to Dec 9. Then it will tour Xi'an, Shaanxi province, from Dec 15 to Dec 22 and Shanghai from Dec 29 to Jan 13. Based on the original French version of the musical, entitled Autant emporte le Vent, in which both lyrics and music were written by the French musical writer Gerard Presgurvic and which premiered in Paris in 2003, the new musical version of Gone With the Wind is a collaboration between the composer, Presgurvic, and the Beijing-based company, Joyway. The company brought Presgurvic's musical, Romeo and Juliet, to China in 2016. According to Zhang Ligang, founder and president of Joyway, the project of adapting the French musical into English started more than two years ago. Zhang and his wife, Qiao Jing, a former host on China Central Television (CCTV), who is the producer of the English version of the musical, flew to Seoul in 2015 to meet Presgurvic, when the musical's Korean edition was staged. Set against the backdrop of the American Civil War in the 1860s, the musical follows the life changes of the main characters, Scarlett O'Hara and her lover Rhett Butler.,\"Like Romeo and Juliet, Gone With the Wind is a clas-sic story, which we still enjoy today. When I wrote the musical, I used music to portray the role of Scarlett O'Hara, who has grown up quite privileged but all the trappings of her luxurious lifestyle are destroyed because of the war. The story is her personal transition from a self-centered and spoiled young girl into a mature and independent woman,\" says Presgurvic, who wrote 28 songs for the musical, blending various musical styles, such as rock, pop and jazz. \"It was much more challenging to make an English version of Gone With the Wind than to bring the original French version. When we initiated the idea of making the English version of the musical, Presgurvic liked it and we did a global casting together,\" says Zhang, noting that the original novel by American author Margret Mitchell in 1936 and the 1939 Hollywood movie starring Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable have both enjoyed great popularity in China. Gone With the Wind is the only novel by Mitchell that was published during her lifetime. Mitchell received the Pulitzer Prize for fiction for the book in 1937. New York-based actress Rachel Gold, who has been seen in The Phantom of the Opera on Broadway playing Christine Daae, will play the role of Scarlett O'Hara, opposite actor, American singer-songwriter, Eric Briarley, as Rhett Butler. \"I've read the book and watched the movie several times to understand the role. Vivien Leigh is very inspiring and I will add my own interpretation into the role,\" Gold says in Beijing. American singer-songwriter, Amy Vachal, who is a semifinalist on the ninth season of popular American TV singing competition, The Voice, plays the role of Melanie Wilkes. Gone With the Wind will mark her debut as a musical actress. French singer-songwriter Cyril Niccolai, who played Ashley Wilkes in the French version of the musical will play the same role in the English version. Frantz Morel, who worked with Presgurvic on the French musical version of Romeo and Juliet will direct the new play. He notes that, of all the 500 costumes created for the musical, Scarlett O'Hara's nine dresses highlight the protagonist's life. The musical will also feature eight styles of dance, including ballet, contemporary dance and waltzes that will be performed by over 30 dancers from around the world. chennan@chinadaily.com.cn  (China Daily 11/19/2018 page20)", "overall-label": "life-style"}
{"content": "Commercial time-honored brands are national treasures. Beijing's time-honored brands are glories of the Chinese capital. During the past 30 years, although many time-honored brands are continuing to develop, some are fading away. There is a wave of regret at the thought of the time-honored food brands such as Puwufang, Baohuachun and Tianyishun that have vanished. The old generation of revolutionary leaders showed loving care for the time-honored brands. Mao Zedong had a few instructions on time-honored brands, including Wangmazi, Zhang Koizumi, Donglaishun, Quanjude, Ruifuxiang, Tongrentang, Business Printing House, Zhonghua Book Company and Fire Palace stinky tofu. \"Wangmazi, Donglaishun and Quanjude will be preserved forever,\" said Mao Zedong. \"Ruifuxiang and Tongrentang will also save a thousand years\u00a1\u00adTo save the name of history, why not the name of Business Printing House and Zhonghua Book Company.\" Most of these time-honored brands Mao referred to are Beijing-based time-honored brands, which have an important position in his life. Mao often frequented Changsha Fire Palace to eat stinky tofu when he was young and went there again after the liberation, leaving saying \"Fire Palace stinky tofu is still delicious\". Then, Changsha Fire Palace used the leader's words to advertise and protect the time-honored brand. It is said that Mao used the \"Zhang Koizumi\" scissors. Zhou Enlai gave instructions to the Shengxifu hat shop \"to keep the characteristic of Shengxifu and organize to run factories\". He liked the \"Wonton hou\" ravioli and specifically invited chefs of \"Wonton hou\" to cook for foreign guests. He lined up in the China photography studio in Beijing Wangfujing Street. Besides, Zhou had creatively explained the word \"Quanjude\". Deng Xiaoping loves to wear the shoes made by Neiliansheng shoe store and had shoes measured there several times. \"The shoes are appropriate, my thanks to the masters of Neiliansheng shoe store,\" Deng said in a message to Neiliansheng one time after his shoes were finished. He gave high praise to this time-honored brand in his words. Xiaoping's family had made a pair of shoes for him in Neiliansheng, hoping he could set foot in Hong Kong after its return to the mainland. Unfortunately, these shoes did not last. This pair of shoes was later officially collected by the National Museum with \"Xiaoping shoes\" named by Neiliansheng. \"This is not Shengxifu and do refrain from labeling others,\" Deng Xiaoping said in a sarcastic and humorous comment in response to a hat factory operated by the Gang of Four during the period of the \"cultural revolution\"(1966-76). Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai and Deng Xiaoping are all great leaders, who live their daily lives as ordinary people and share the same love and appreciation for time-honored brands.

Three choreographers are involved with the project, including well-known British dancer, Akram Khan. The production has gathered together top talent from around the world, including the UK, the Netherlands and South Korea. This is 25-year-old Hua Xiaoyi's first contemporary dance work. She has been practicing classical dance for 14 years, and has been honored twice for her skills on the stage. In her past works, she has portrayed a variety of roles.  But with this work, she wants to be herself.,\"I think this is a breakthrough. I'm attempting to express myself through another language,\" she explained. \"The most difficult part is psychological, since I've practiced classical dance before. It's such a different dance language. This time, I want to give up the familiar things and accept a fresh challenge. This work expresses the theme of choice; we face choices in every moment through our life, it's precious.\" A year ago, Hua initiated the   idea, which was supported by Xu Rui, vice president of the Beijing Dance Academy. Hua remembered how she was inspired by British dancer Akram Khan's abilities when she saw his show in New York in 2013. With Xu's help, Hua got in contact with Khan and invited him to choreograph in her show.,Xu, who shaped and helped finish the whole production, recalled time with the team.  \"Real meaning of this international team is inter-cultural cooperation. We have different culture backgrounds and we have different understanding. We encouraged and inspired by each other,\" Xu Rui said Consisting of four sections, the whole production was choreographed by Khan and Chinese artists Lou Menghan and Gao Chengming.,Menghan, who choreographed the third section, explained what he was trying to express.  \"My piece is roughly translated into dancing on my own. But you don't need to get the meaning only by the words. What I want to say is when we are alone as a dancer and this reflects to Xiaoyi, now with her, another step of her career. Always try something and challenge herself. I use different element, express in different moves.\" The show will move to Shanghai on Nov. 21 and 22.", "overall-label": "life-style"}
{"content": "As People's Liberation Army (PLA) of China celebrates its 85th Founding Anniversary on 1st August, I can\u00a1\u00aft help thinking of those old days when I stayed with Chinese soldiers.  PLA, true to its name always maintained its basic peoples' army character. It always bore in mind what Mao Zedong taught, army is more like a fish and people are like the water in a river. This has been the ethos of PLA and the essence of China's civil military relationship. PLA was never isolated from the broad masses and always remained deeply involved in all national developments and socioeconomic activities. It played a dominant role in national reconstruction and infrastructure building and combating natural disasters, like floods, cyclones, tornadoes, draughts and earthquakes. PLA always enjoyed the utmost trust, confidence, love and respect of the people of China. It is an all pervasive force with multidimensional characters. It is a fighting force par excellence with highest combat readiness. It is a productive force beyond comparison and skilled workforce, the colossus of which the world has not seen before.  I recall, I had the opportunity to live in a PLA unit in a garrison very near to Beijing for a month in mid 1977. It was a part of the study curriculum, during my study in Beijing Modern Languages Institute. President Ziaur Rahman, the visionary leader of Bangladesh, who believed in strong Sino-Bangla relation, sent me to China to study Chinese language for my future employment as military attach\u00a8\u00a6 in the embassy. In my outdoor study ( ) I was sent to a PLA unit, I lived in the military barracks along with the PLA junior commanders.    There was no rank system in PLA at that time and officers were called commanders and soldiers, the fighters. I put on their uniform, ate, worked, played and slept with them. I was introduced with the great master military strategist of ancient China, Sun Tzu and his epic work Art of War. I was given many tactical combat lessons. I was taken to the firing range to learn the skills of shooting. I found PLA soldiers were most accurate on to their targets and never missed any shot. The PLA unit where I lived was fully self-sufficient to cater its logistic needs. It had its own uniform and shoe making factory, it had its own agricultural fields to grow grains and vegetables, own farm yards to raise cattle and get meat and dairy products. The unit was even running a medicine factory to produce medicine for local use and surplus sold outside. I remember, in my Chinese language class text book there were many easy reading short stories. I read stories of Lei Feng, the great soldier of PLA, who dedicated his life for the service of poor people and was always available to rush in their crises and difficulties. The motto of PLA, he firmly believed, was  serve the people. Many such moving stories and their valuable lessons and my intimate stay with PLA soldiers enriched and helped me to know and understand them very closely. They all left a deep impression in my life and I still treasure them, cherish them. Now as I reminisce my good old days in China in my leisure hours at my home in Dhaka, strange spells of feelings strike me, I get somewhat nostalgic. China, I always considered my second home, I lived there in the 70s and 80s for more than half a decade. About 35 years ago when I lived in China, she made a tiny footprint in global economy and political and military power. Today as I see China, I am totally amazed. What a wonder China has done! China today has emerged as a most vibrant and strong nation already occupying the center stage of world economy and power. China\u00a1\u00afs phenomenal rise within shortest possible time (only three decades or so) is a miracle story. But miracles do happen. It happened in China. It happened because of country\u00a1\u00afs wise and able leadership, pragmatic correct policies, national unity and solidarity and harmony. The unifying factor and the stabilizing core element have always been PLA, the liberator, the redeemer. It indeed always remained most patriotic, dedicated, most loyal and trusted to the people as the name PLA indicates. It never failed in its tasks and never fell short of people's hopes and aspirations.  China, to protect its land, air and sea is vigorously and unabatedly pursuing its modernisation drive and is fully confident to thwart any eventuality. However, PLA, with all its big technological advancement and modernisation changes, the basic people's characters has not changed, it remains truly the people\u00a1\u00afs army, for the service of the people, for their welfare and wellbeing and for their security.  I recall, I was invited to China by PLA in 1996 when I was the Chief of Army staff. Brigadier Khairul Anam (now regular column writer in The Daily Star) was our defence attach\u00a8\u00a6 in Beijing. He arranged my meetings with top PLA leaders. I also had the honored privilege to meet His Excellency Jiang Zemin, the President of China and Chairman of the Central Military Comission, the highest military organ of the country. I remember, President Jiang said, \"China has changed a lot. It is not the same China which you saw when you lived here in the 70s and 80s\". He said, \"It is a changed China, developed China and it is a new generation, a new leadership.\" He also said, \"The world is changing. I heard Dhaka skyline has also changed. But in all these changes one thing has not changed and it will never change and that is our relationship with Bangladesh, our policy for Bangladesh.\" He continued, \"I assure you General, China is your friend and will ever remain a friend. In time of need she will be always beside you.\" His words still ring in my ear. I treasure them. I believe this epitomizes our two militaries and two countries true relationship. Long live PLA. Long live Sino-Bangla defence cooperation.  ", "overall-label": "politics"}

{"content": "Inspired by a scene in a Soviet film that showed cattle and sheep roaming on a prairie under a blue sky and white clouds, He Jingrong, from Beijing, decided to specialize in caring for livestock when she went to university. \"I thought what a nice job it would be,\" said He, an 80-something retiree who was a senior vet at China Agricultural University Veterinary Teaching Hospital in Beijing's Haidian district. She enrolled at China Agricultural University to study Western veterinary science in 1958. Two years later, after the government decided to strengthen efforts to protect folk veterinary medicine, she was among the first group of students selected to major in a newly established traditional Chinese veterinary medicine course at the university. At that time, over 80,000 of the 90,000 vets in China lived and worked in the countryside. Without any textbooks, He and 13 other students went to the countryside to learn from veteran vets' practical experience in treating sick animals. The knowledge passed down included things like heating the sole of a shoe and applying it to heal a rectal prolapse, and using an 8-year-old boy's urine as an ingredient to enhance the efficacy of a dose of medicine. After graduation, the 14 vets were assigned to 14 different provinces. He was sent to eastern China's Shandong province, where she had a hard time as she had to jump into sties to treat pigs and hurry around to treat an average of 50 patients a day. Being a vet is a risky career, as He can attest. Two vets she knew died after they were kicked by horses. One was kicked in the stomach and ruptured a kidney when examining a horse's forelegs. One classmate decided to switch careers soon after graduation when a buffalo horn scarred her face while she was performing acupuncture on the animal's hind legs. A dog bit off a doctor's nose and He, who returned to Beijing in 1970, had to have three rabies shots after being bitten by animals. \"Everybody looked down on us then,\" she said. \"My family would complain I had wasted five years in college, and that it would have been better to become a laborer.\" However, she said the status of vets has been greatly boosted in recent years. \"Now people say it is a career to make money,\" He said.", "overall-label": "education"}

A challenge of going 21 days without losing your temper, which was set as homework for a class of third-grade students and their parents during the summer vacation in Wuhan, has suddenly become an internet hit, reports the Beijing Youth Daily. The homework was set by Cheng Hong, the head teacher of the first class of the third grade in the Zhonghua Road Elementary School in Wuhan's Wuchang District. Attention was immediately drawn to the special homework after it was shared on the internet, despite the summer vacation having ended weeks ago. Some netizens commented that 21 hours is already a long time let alone 21 days, while other doubted the necessity of the challenge. Cheng told the Beijing Youth Daily that the aim of the challenge was to remind parents about the importance of ensuring a good domestic environment for children to be able to learn to manage their emotions. Based on the \"diary-like\" recordings of the 44 students in the class, only one set of twins and their parents completed the challenge. Cheng says she found that parents were more likely to get angry than the children, with 80 percent of the disputes originating from the children's homework. Many parents who participated in the challenge were cited as saying that they have learnt the importance of managing their emotions on a daily basis as this will have a major effect on the children's emotions. One mom has also reportedly come up with innovative ways of managing the bad emotions in the family during the challenge.

{"content": "Beijing-based wholly foreign-owned travel agencies are expected to dip their toes in the outbound tourism market, as the capital city has forwarded request for approval, Beijing Business Today reported on Monday. The move comes after Wan Cheng (Shanghai) Travel Service Co Ltd, controlled by a Hong Kong enterprise, became the first of its kind in Chinese mainland to run outbound travel business last year; and UK travel agency Thomas Cook set up a joint venture with Fosun Tourism group in Sanya, Hainan province, last week. Since 2003, when the first wholly foreign-owned travel agency established in China, these agencies have been only allowed to engage in inbound tourism, which was on a slow development track compared with robust outbound tourism market. Beijing Business Today cited data showing that more than 90 percent of nearly 30 foreign travel companies in Chinese mainland operated in the red until the first half of 2015. On the other hand, statistics from Ministry of Culture and Tourism revealed the number of Chinese visits abroad reached 71.31 million in the first six month of this year, a 15 percent increase from a year earlier. Meanwhile, China has been the top country in spending the most during traveling out of border for consecutive years, the newspaper said. Shi Jianzhong, secretary-general of Beijing Tourism Industry Association, told Beijing Business Today that competition in the sector will become fierce if wholly foreign-owned travel agencies participate in outbound tourism in China, adding that it is not a bad thing for a wider opening-up, because Chinese players could learn foreign management concept and promote product development and consumers will also have more choices with more affordable prices. And the tourism industry may face a shakeup, as foreign entrants, such as American Express, Germany's Touristik Union International and Japan Travel Bureau Foundation, could invest a lot to expand their sales network either built on their own or through acquisition, Liu Simin, a researcher at Beijing Foreign Studies University, said. But they also have to be ready for a long battle and understand Chinese market, Liu added. At the same time, industry insiders said high profits in outbound tourism seem lucrative, but many changes still remain in the business, including long-lasting process of market expanding and cultivating and high requirement for integrating capacity.", "overall-label": "politics"}
{"content": "BEIJING - The world was watching when China and the United States held economic and trade consultations in Beijing Thursday and Friday. What signals have the talks sent? What did the two sides discuss and what does the future hold? Stable economic and trade ties between the world's two biggest economies benefit not only themselves, but also the greater global economy. During the talks, the two sides agreed that a sound and stable China-US trade relationship is crucial for both, and they are committed to resolving relevant economic and trade issues through dialogue and consultation. They had thorough exchange of views on issues including increasing US exports to China, bilateral service trade, two-way investment, protection of intellectual property rights (IPR), as well as resolving tariff and non-tariff issues, reaching consensus in some areas. \"It was a good time to reduce China-US trade frictions,\" said Song Guoyou, deputy director of Fudan University center for American studies. The meetings showed both sides willing to address economic and trade issues and narrow their disagreements through dialogue, Song said. By proposing a trip to China for consultations, the US side demonstrated the importance it attaches to China-US trade and economic issues, and its sincerity for addressing them. China and the United States can tackle trade frictions \"in a rational, prudent manner,\" said Zhao Longyue, a professor at Guangdong University of Foreign Studies. \"From the view of long-term development, win-win cooperation is the fundamental way to resolve these kinds of issues.\" \"China and the United States are natural partners. Their economies are strongly complementary,\" said Wang Yong, a professor with Peking University school of international studies. For example, more US exports to China creates opportunities for US firms and products, while meeting the demands of Chinese consumers with better incomes for greater quality of life, Wang said. Talks like these, while candid and pragmatic, necessarily involve disagreements and bargaining. The Chinese side vigorously struck back at unsubstantiated accusations on issues including IPR and the unreasonable demand that it is up to China to reduce the US trade deficit, sources close to the talks said. Chinese negotiators firmly defended the interests of the nation and its people throughout, the sources said. China lodged solemn representations with the United States concerning the ZTE case during the consultations, a spokesperson with China's Ministry of Commerce said Friday. The US side said they attach importance to China's representations and will report China's stance to the US president. Li Yong of the China Association of International Trade, said that if agreement could be reached on the ZTE case, it would set an example for further high-tech cooperation between Chinese and American enterprises. \"In this age of globalization, frictions are not solved by crippling others, a negative mindset, through coercion or by unilateral thinking. These approaches will hurt both Chinese and American enterprises. The world's industrial chains will also be damaged,\" said Li. Tu Xinquan, a professor with the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, said all negotiations need to be egalitarian. China never bows to pressure and maintains a principled stance. Equality, frankness, rationality and pragmatism are prerequisite to future consultations, he said. Both sides of the talks recognized that given that considerable differences still exist on some issues, continued hard work is required for more progress. They also agreed to stay in close communication on relevant issues and establish a corresponding work mechanism. Dong Yan with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences believes structural problems in the China-US economic and trade relationship are unavoidable, judging from the perspectives of history and international relations. \"It's normal to have disparity and even friction, but these factors should not be allowed to set the direction of China-US cooperation,\" Dong said. Zhao Longyue said that China and the United States need to take a long-term view from the perspective of development. Instead of being burdened by trade deficits, both sides can exploit their respective advantages in different sectors in an active and cooperative manner, realizing resource complementarity, common development, mutual benefit and win-win results, he suggested. \"We must not imagine one brief consultation will solve all our problems. Apart from sincerity, both sides need to show patience, and respect the policy environment of each other,\" said Li Yong. Both sides need frank, rational and pragmatic exchanges, to seek common ground and put their disagreements aside, maximize their converging interests, and be responsible to their people and the world at large, Li said.", "overall-label": "business"}

{"content": "Online food apps are changing everyday life for Zhou Huan, a 25-year-old worker from Beijing, as all her meals can be brought by deliverymen no matter where she is. But recently she was even more pleased when an unmanned vehicle delivered her meal directly to a shopping mall in Beijing. \"You know what? I was so surprised when a robot approached me and said clearly that the food had arrived,\" Zhou said. The intelligent machine was developed by Meituan-Dianping, China's largest on-demand service provider, to offer customers unmanned online delivery services. It is also indicative of the country's digital transformation. Major tech companies in the country including Baidu Inc, JD and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd have all found themselves in a good position to develop autonomous deliveries to back up their businesses. Together, they are driving a burgeoning online food delivery market in China where a total of 300 million customers like Zhou order food online through popular apps. Meituan-Dianping, a group buying and dining platform with 320 million active users and more than 4 million merchants, started trial operations of autonomous deliveries in the shopping mall, office building and university campus last year. The company's autonomous delivery car is able to ferry food such as drinks, fruit and snacks from a local store to the residents. Embedded with leading camera, radar and GPS technologies, it can also avoid cars and passers-by automatically. Recently, it also launched its autonomous delivery service in Xiongan New Area, as part of its broader efforts to accelerate the application and commercialization of unmanned technologies. \"We will implement autonomous delivery not only between buildings but also within buildings by the end of this year in some areas in Xiongan,\" said Xia Huaxia, head of autonomous delivery at Meituan-Dianping. By then, delivery cars will be able travel up and down in building elevators, without anyone having to push the elevator buttons for them, he said. Xia agreed that its service would continue to rely on its delivery staff to some extent for quite some time into the foreseeable future. \"Currently, autonomous vehicles will act as a supplement to our delivery staff, especially for late-night deliveries, as unmanned vehicles can work round-the-clock,\" he added. Wang Xing, CEO of Meituan-Dianping, noted that the Beijing-based company will promote large-scale operation of autonomous delivery vehicles by 2019. An industry analyst pointed out that the autonomous delivery industry is promising since the national online delivery market is huge. The size of the Chinese online delivery market exceeded 297 billion yuan ($46.5 billion) last year, which represented an annual growth of more than 65 percent and is expected to exceed 360 billion yuan this year, said an industry report. \"As such, major internet companies are scrambling to tap into autonomous delivery to bolster their competitiveness to gain a lead,\" said Yang Xu, a life and services analyst at consultancy Analysys. \"Emerging technologies including unmanned delivery will be the core engine driving its businesses in the future,\" he added. However, Yang noted that the commercialization of autonomous delivery remains a long way off and still faces some challenges. Before this can be achieved, a number of problems including complicated road conditions, technological bottlenecks, operating costs and supervision need to be dealt with, said Yang, adding that related rules and regulations have yet to be issued. \"Autonomous delivery is never easy. We will continue to join forces with different partners to jointly develop technologies needed for unmanned delivery vehicles,\" said Wang Huiwen, co-founder and senior deputy president of Meituan-Dianping. \"We hope to accelerate the rollout of unmanned delivery in the country in the near future,\" she said.", "overall-label": "tech"}

Last year, a pair of stone candelabra found in a Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) emperor's tomb was stolen in Beijing, but local officials covered up the theft for months. After the artifacts were traced, 17 administrators, including six department heads, were disciplined for the incident. Twelve officials in Hebei province were also held responsible in 2016 after an illegal real estate development was started near the Eastern Qing Tombs, which date back to the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). Both locations are part of the Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties, an inscribed UNESCO World Heritage site. Fires resulting in damage to six key cultural heritage sites under State protection also led to 23 officials receiving punishments in 2017, according to culture authorities. Luo said China recently established an accountability system to clarify who is responsible for protecting each of the country's 767,000 registered \"unmovable\" cultural heritage sites, such as structures and monuments. China has prevented several major crimes involving cultural relics, Luo said. For example, he said, the Ministry of Public Security released most-wanted lists twice last year specifically to strike at such crimes. It led to the capture of 16 of the 20 suspects in the list. \"Protection of cultural relics has many more legal references now,\" the minister said. However, to implement the laws that safeguard cultural relics, it is essential to conduct an archaeological investigation before any major infrastructure construction begins, he added. Luo said having a clear understanding of cultural resources is one way to better protect the nation's heritage. Consequently, the Culture Ministry has organized several nationwide surveys in the past five years. The surveys found that 108 million cultural relics are housed in public museums and other State-owned institutions. More than 870,000 intangible cultural heritage items were also registered, Luo said. He called for better protection of intangible cultural heritage, and said it should be promoted among the public in creative ways to enrich people's cultural lives. Luo cited the third season of A Bite of China, which was broadcast recently by China Central Television, as a show that promotes culinary culture. A type of iron pan made through traditional craftsmanship sold out almost immediately after being featured in one episode of the latest season. \"We need more ways to keep such heritage items alive and let them improve people's livelihoods,\" Luo said.", "overall-label": "politics"}
{"content": "Short trips to admire the beauty of spring flowers were popular among Chinese during the Tomb Sweeping Day holiday, which lasted from Sunday to Tuesday, according to travel agencies. A report released on Tuesday by leading online travel agency Ctrip showed that people were keen to take short trips around their home cities to enjoy spring blossoms during the three-day holiday. In cities like Beijing and Chongqing, short trip packages to suburban areas or city outskirts with blossom-viewing opportunities were among the best-selling, the report said. Apart from seasonal flowers like cole flowers and sakura, peach flowers also attracted lots of attention, thanks to  a TV serial romance that has gone viral recently among young people. Ctrip's finding was echoed in a report by online travel agency lvmama.com, which found that people were passionate about spring outings during the holiday, due to the sunny and warm days. Bookings of short trips on Lvmama tripled that from the same period last year. The report also found that apart from some traditionally hot tourism destinations, like Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, other major cities, including Nanjing and Suzhou of Jiangsu province, Hangzhou of Zhejiang province and Wuhan of Hubei province, also attracted large numbers of tourists during the holiday.", "overall-label": "life-style"}

{"content": "  The centuries-old art form of pingshu, or storytelling, is making a welcome return to television after a long hiatus. Xu Fan reports.  One desk and one folded fan was all that consisted for the props used by pingshu (storytelling) master Tian Lianyuan to bring to life a battlefield story from Yang Jia Jiang (Generals of the Yang Family), an influential novel based on the titular legendary family in the Northern Song Dynasty (960-1127) era.  Although Tian is 76 years old, he delivered his dialogue with power and performed with emotion.  When the plot rose to its climax - where a warrior on horseback wields his sword as he rides toward his enemy - he abruptly kicked his leg high to mimic the role's martial   skills.  The stunt drew ovations from the audience, who watched the performance at the headquarters of one of the country's biggest broadcasters, Beijing TV, on Nov 22.  Alongside well-known pingshu artists Lian Liru and Liu Lanfang, Tian was shooting Beijing Pingshu Dahui (Assembly of Pingshu Artists in Beijing), a program showcasing the artists' storytelling performances.  The 25-minute program started to air on Nov 28 on Beijing Satellite TV, and is scheduled to be broadcast every morning from Tuesday to Friday.  Pingshu is a traditional art form that usually sees a performer wrapped in a Chinese-  gown recount a legend through dialogue and exaggerated gestures. Most of the stories are adapted from classic novels penned by ancient authors.      Once limited to audiences on street corners or  houses, pingshu gained unprecedented popularity from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, thanks to a number of programs that ran on television and radio, the dominant entertainment platforms at the time.  As a pioneer to usher in the \"golden decade\", Tian was the first person to appear on television screens and perform pingshu on a show run by Liaoning TV, the provincial broadcaster, in 1985. He is also the first pingshu artist to wear a suit instead of a traditional gown.  On the Liaoning TV shows, he was telling the stories of Yang Jia Jiang, the classic novel penned by Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) author Xiong Damu. To make the traditional art form more intriguing to modern audiences, Tian explored ways to innovate.  \"A traditional pingshu show lasts for two hours. The first 30 minutes act as a prologue and the plot twists appear in the following 90 minutes. But that would not work for a television show. It's too slow. Audiences would switch to another channel,\" explains Tian.  As Liaoning TV limited Tian to 20 minutes per episode, he rewrote the scripts, cut the introduction to three minutes, and added stunts to spark the audience's imagination.  \"In the past, pingshu was an art form to be listened to. But since television has popularized it, it has become more of an art form to be watched,\" adds Tian.  Propelled by the success of Tian's shows, one of the highly-rated TV programs of the time, more than 20 television stations - including the country's most-watched broadcaster CCTV - produced similar shows, prompting pingshu to rise to the peak of its popularity.  But the glory faded after the mid-1990s, due to falling production standards and the rise of television dramas. Over the past decade, pingshu programs have almost disappeared from TV screens.  In 2008, pingshu was inscribed in China's national   list, putting it back in the spotlight. The rapid growth and popularity of the internet has helped pingshu to reach more audiences through online video clips.  Now with Beijing Pingshu Dahui, the centuries-old art form has made a return to television screens after a decadelong break, and may witness a revival, says Tian, with an excited gleam in his eye.  Tian's forum on Baidu Tieba, a popular online community, currently has 4,160 followers who have written 38,000 posts.  But the humble artist says: \"I am old. The future is in the hands of the youngsters.\"  Besides, Tian says he has yet to completely recover from a terrible car accident three years ago, which caused the death of his son and severely injured him.  When the Beijing program's producers called him, Tian was initially reluctant to join the show. He didn't give it the nod until the TV company persuaded him with a powerful reason: His reputation could help to revive the art form.  \"China's television industry now has some shallow, mass-market entertainment productions. I hope the younger generations can learn more about traditional culture and benefit from its legacy,\" he says.  Tian also mentions  winner of the Nobel prize in literature who once revealed that his childhood hobby of listening to pingshu opened up his imagination and encouraged him to start writing.  \"Pingshu dates back more than 2,000 years. From the emperors' courts to public areas, it has influenced generations. It's our duty to publicize this unique art form created by the Chinese,\" says Tian.  Speaking about the future, Tian recalls his visits to perform pingshu in Canada and Russia, which he describes as inspirational.  \"I saw some foreigners sitting among the audiences. It convinced me that this Chinese art form could also appeal beyond borders,\" he says.  \"I am too old to learn English. But if the young performers can speak English fluently, I believe pingshu will be enjoyed more in the West.\"   ", "overall-label": "life-style"}
{"content": "College students from around the world will learn how to build a community with a shared future for mankind through a summer school at Beijing Normal University. The opening ceremony for the annual philosophy summer school was held at the university on Monday. Thirty-four students from 16 countries and nine from domestic universities will spend two weeks together learning about traditional Chinese philosophy and contemporary China. Wu Xiangdong, dean of the university's school of philosophy, said it is quite relevant for young students from different countries to discuss how to build a community with a shared future, given rising nationalist thinking and trade protectionism in various countries. It is the first time the summer school, now its fourth year, has added the shared future theme to the program - co-hosted by the university and the Confucius Institute Headquarters in Beijing. It also focuses on Confucianism and the concept of seeking harmony in diversity, an idea put forward by Confucius more than 2,000 years ago that can help to solve problems facing the world today, Wu said. Different countries and civilizations are like musical notes, he said. Only by being different can they compose music. Likewise, countries should overcome cultural misunderstandings and conflicts through more exchanges, mutual learning, dialogue and inclusiveness, he added. Traditional Chinese calligraphy and tai chi will also be part of their stay. They will visit famous scenic spots in Beijing, including the Great Wall, the Forbidden City and the National Museum of China. John Major, an independent scholar of Chinese history and a lecturer at the summer school, said that while Confucianism was introduced to the Western world four centuries ago, it is still little understood. The students can serve as ambassadors when they return home to spread the word that Confucianism is still relevant to modern life, he said. Travis Quigley, a student majoring in political science from Tufts University in the United States, said Western philosophy advocates maximizing the interests of individuals, while Confucian teachings emphasize the values of generosity and humanitarianism. The program makes connections between potential future leaders by forging personal and intellectual bonds. People across many nations can help solve disagreements in the way that forming personal friendships can help bring different groups closer, he said. Runeko Lovell, also from the university, said the summer school provides a great opportunity to learn about Chinese culture and philosophy, which is not well-understood in the West. From interactions with students from China and other countries, we can learn how to build a more close-knit and inclusive community, he said, adding: \"The world needs a community with a shared future for mankind more than ever.\" ", "overall-label": "education"}

Northeast China, the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region in Northwest China, Japan, Switzerland and North America, have emerged as the top skiing destinations for avid Chinese skiers, according to Qunar, an online travel firm that was acquired by Ctrip, China's largest online travel agency. More affluent millennials, including those born after 1995 and 2000, spend most of their leisure time skiing and snowboarding. Ski lovers in China, whose numbers are rising, go skiing almost four times a year on average, and their per-capita spend exceeded 1,300 yuan ($191) each time. The volume of online searches on mobile phones for skiing products surged 79 percent over last winter, Qunar found. \"From a pure sport, skiing has become a comprehensive travel experience. It comprises admission tickets, hotels, training, snow museum visits and delicacy savoring,\" said Song Yawen, director of themed tours at Qunar. The 2022 Winter Olympics will be held in Beijing and Zhangjiakou city, Hebei province, located about 200 kilometers northwest of Beijing. In the run-up to the quadrennial event, these places are attracting skiing fans. High-speed trains will soon connect Beijing and Zhangjiakou, and shrink travel time from four hours to about one hour. \"By buying our new recreation service online, a consumer can take a 35-minute helicopter ride from Beijing to Chongli for 3,000 yuan. Four people can fly at a time. Hanging baskets can carry along cargo like skiing gear,\" Song said. \"Besides, we have introduced some snow-related travel products with activities like snowmobile rides, sledge rides, ice sculpting and winter fishing.\" In Ewenki autonomous banner of North China, playing with reindeer and dog sled is part of ice-and snow-themed tour packages. For Tian Shen, 26, a bank employee and an experienced skier in Beijing, winter means hitting the white slopes at various places in China. She has been going to ski resorts in Zhangjiakou almost every weekend this winter. Around New Year's Day, she made a trip to Songhua Lake, Jilin province in Northeast China, one of the most popular skiing destinations in the country. \"I love the feeling of fast sliding, and as control over my body gets better and better with practice, it makes me feel good. This year, I plan to try more difficult movements of snowboarding that require skill,\" Tian said.

{"content": "Overwhelming applause erupted at the National Center for the Performing Arts when foreign singers performed   a popular Chinese song from the 1980s, in a bel canto style. On Sept 4, 37 young performers from 12 countries gave a concert in Beijing, offering the audience a musical feast to tell the story of China over the past 40 years. The concert was part of this year's iSING! Suzhou International Young Artists Festival, a program to train young vocal artists and to promote cultural exchanges. Potential foreign and Chinese artists were selected from three continents to receive one month of training from some of the world's most respected opera coaches, before making performances in East China's Suzhou city as well as Shanghai and Beijing. \"I have known about this program for nearly seven years. I thought being a participant is something that I would never be able to achieve. Therefore, coming here is like fulfilling my dream,\" says Milica Jovi?i?, a performer from Serbia.,The selected performers focused on improving their vocal abilities and learning Mandarin lyric voice during the one month. To commemorate China's reform and opening-up, which began in 1978, the performance included popular Chinese songs from different times over the past four decades, such as     and . Performers also sang several beloved foreign pieces, such as  and \"Singing is an ideal way for us to exchange culture and ideas, and to make connections,\" says Juliet Petrus, a US performer who joined the program for a third time. According to the art director Tian Haojiang, by inviting foreign artists to China, they get an opportunity to approach China and its culture. Chinese artists, in turn, can also have the chance to stand on international stages.,When he appeared in an opera 17 years ago in Italy, he found foreign musicians had a very limited understanding of Chinese culture, not to mention Chinese music. He wondered why the cultural exchange is so imbalanced. Many Chinese musicians go abroad and know Western culture very well, but their Western counterparts are so unfamiliar with Chinese culture. \"I can sing Western operas in six foreign languages. Why can't Westerners sing in Chinese?\" says Tian. He decided to change the situation by setting up iSING!. Over the past eight years, the program has selected about 160 singers from over 3,000 applicants to join in, with many participants having won prizes in international competitions. Tian and his group members also performed onstage at the 2018 Spring Festival Gala, or Chunwan in Chinese. \"I have achieved so many things in this group, including improving my professional skills and making good friends.

{"content": "    The Beijing festival, which opens on Oct 8, always features world-class musicians and concerts. Chen Jie reports. October is the main season for classical music fans in the capital as the Beijing Music Festival always features world-class musicians and concerts. This year, the annual festival has a unique program to mark its 20th anniversary. Yu Long, the artistic director of BMF will conduct the China Philharmonic Orchestra, of which he is also the music director, to open the festival on Oct 8. The orchestra will perform with violinist Frank Peter Zimmermann and his violinist son Serge Zimmermann. Then, in the next 22 days, the festival will feature 29 performances including three operas and children's concerts, lectures, masters-classes and opening rehearsals. The highlights include Wagner's opera  all of Beethoven's symphonies by Deutsche Kammer Philharmonie Bremen, an orchestral marathon by nine of China's symphony orchestras and concerts dedicated to Chinese composers and works. The BMF has presented 48 operas since it began in 1998. And 26 of them have made their debuts in China. Wagner seems to be the favorite, though German composers' operas are not as popular as Italian ones like   or  . The BMF has staged Wagner's    and    and  .,  In 2005, it took 15 hours over four nights for The Ring Cycle premiere in China. This year, BMF has co-produced Die Walkure with the Salzburg Easter Festival. In 1967, the first Salzburg Easter Festival presented Richard Wagner's  also known as  conducted by Herbert von Karajan (1908-89). This year, to mark the 50th anniversary of the festival, the Bulgarian director, Vera Nemirova, has produced Die Walkure, one section of the cycle, based on the original version of Karajan. \"This revival not only brings back the historical Karajan creation, but poses questions as how the play is to be reinterpreted for our time,\" says Yu. The Beijing production will feature an international cast and the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra under the baton of Jaap Van Zweden. Meanwhile, to mark the 190th anniversary of Beethoven's death, the BMF has invited The Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bermen to perform all nine of Beethoven's symphonies. \"Beethoven is no stranger to Chinese audiences. And when talking about classical music, most people focus on Beethoven, Mozart or Tchaikovsky. \"And Beethoven's   and Tchaikovsky's   are very popular.,  \"But it's very rare, actually, it's the first time to have all 9 of Beethoven's symphonies in a few days in Beijing,\" says Tu Song, BMF's Music Festival program director. The other \"large\" program is an \"Orchestral Marathon\"\u00a3\u00adnine of China's orchestras, each conducted by their music director, performing in turn, for 10 hours from 10 am to 10 pm with a 2-hour break, on Oct 14. Then, at the end of the day, selected musicians from each orchestra will form \"The Beijing Music Festival Orchestra\" to play Tchaikovsky's   under the baton of Yu. Speaking about the program, Li Nan, the deputy director of the China Philharmonic Orchestra, who has worked with Yu since the beginning of the BMF and the CPO, says: \"It's an idea came to my mind some 20 years ago when we were just starting the festival. \"I bet that classical music is the genre that has developed the fastest in China in last two decades,\" says Li, adding: \"In 1995, it took a China orchestra two months to rehearse Shostakovich's  . But now a Mahler piece only takes two to three hours. \"China has some 70 orchestras. And many have regular seasons, well-prepared programs and tour around the world. \"So, it is time to do such a 'festival orchestra' to let leading musicians sit together.\",  Though some of the world's leading musicians believe that China is the future of classical music, Yu and Li both say that what China's classical music scene needs is more music works. Yu says: \"We have few choices of Chinese works when we tour abroad, except for the violin concerto   or the folk song  . We need contemporary works.\" To ensure this, since the first BMF in 1998, the duo have staged a program every year devoted to original works by Chinese composers. As a result, Tan Dun, Guo Wenjing, Zhou Long, Ye Xiaogang, Chen Qigang and other Chinese composers who have enjoyed fame in the Western world, have all presented their works at BMF. On Oct 16, the Beijing Symphony Orchestra will perform a concert featuring an all-Chinese program comprising Guo Wenjing's  Zhang Qianyi's   and Zhou Long's  \u00a3\u00ad . And at the closing concert on Oct 29, the China Philharmonic Orchestra will perform the world premiere of Chen Qigang's  . Maxim Vengerov will play the violin for the piece which was commissioned by the Beijing Music Festival. \"A Chinese work played by a China orchestra featuring an international soloist.

{"content": "While living in perpetual darkness cannot stop visually impaired people from reaching out for love, other people's opinions can. That's a lesson Liang Jiangbo learned in adolescence. In 2002, while studying at a middle school for blind and visually impaired children in Nanjing, Jiangsu province, the then 16-year-old received a letter in his capacity as class monitor. He opened the letter, which was written in Braille, and discovered that it was from a blind girl in his home province of Anhui, asking about the curriculum and life on campus. Liang replied in detail, and the two quickly became pen pals and later classmates. Though the pair never knew what the other looked like, the congeniality and companionship they felt quickly turned into something more than friendship. They arranged to apply together for a prestigious blind high school in Qingdao, Shandong province, and hoped to later study at the same college. Their intimacy quickly spread around campus and became obvious to Liang's parents, who were more concerned about the inconvenience that could arise from the union of two blind people than fears that the relationship would affect their studies. Liang's parents even went so far as to tell him about the difficulties a blind couple would face when their parents were too old to care for them, and how their children might be bullied for having blind parents who could only offer limited assistance. Gradually, barriers grew between the pair and they broke up before graduation. \"We were both worried by what other people said, and our relationship was affected,\" said Liang, who is now a Braille proofreader with the China Braille Press in Beijing. \"I went on to high school in Qingdao and later to Beijing for college, whereas she chose not to, as a sign of severing ties with me.\" Liang is one of a large number of visually impaired people who have been encouraged to downplay the importance of true love and marry partners with better vision. Blind and visually impaired people are categorized as the most vulnerable among disabled people, and are told that they will only make it through life if they marry a sighted person. Influenced by such opinions, visually impaired city dwellers choose to marry sighted rural residents who want urban hukou - household registration - to make their lives easier. Though some relationships turn out to be good matches, large numbers of these utilitarian unions do not last long, according to experts.,In 2011, Liang was working as a radio host at a media company in Beijing when he met his fiancee, an able-bodied colleague. \"We felt attracted to each other. We would often go out for food or karaoke with friends,\" he said. Liang was concerned about whether he was handsome enough, if his girlfriend minded his disability and if he would be able to take care of her as well as an able-bodied partner. But in a country that once had a long tradition of parents arranging their children's marriages, his greatest fear was the objections put forward by his girlfriend's parents. \"When her parents learned about us, they were strongly against us being together, and there seemed no room for negotiation,\" he said. However, the couple remained resolute. They have now been together for seven years, and her parents have accepted the relationship. Over the years, Liang has proved himself as a partner and won his girlfriend's parents over. \"Using a smartphone equipped with screen-reading software, I can order food for her online, and I can also hail a cab and wait at her office after work. If two people are determined to stay together, most problems won't remain problems,\" he said. Shi Ran, a blind employee at China Braille Press, said parental approval matters for such mixed couples because it's almost impossible for them to be entirely independent of their parents after marriage. \"If the parents are not happy with the marriage, there may be problems that could be quite upsetting,\" the 36-year-old single woman said, citing the example of a blind friend who married another blind person. \"Parents on both sides were unhappy about the marriage, but the four seniors have to meet regularly because of their children's conditions. It is torture for everyone involved,\" she said. There is no recent data on the marital status of China's 12.6 million visually impaired people, but experts agree that they are the least favored partners when disabled people choose to marry, along with those with intellectual disabilities. According to a 1983 survey conducted by Teng Weimin, former vice-chairman of the China Blind Person's Association, less than half of the 1,000 visually impaired people surveyed in 10 cities nationwide were married. \"I doubt the number has risen significantly,\" the 64-year-old said. \"In the past, overprotective rules meant it was unusual for disabled partners to divorce. But now divorce has become common if problems arise.\",Teng noted that widespread discrimination against the visually impaired is a major contributor to martial hardship. \"Many believe blind people are ultra-dependent and can do nothing on their own, which is not the case,\" said the former optometrist in Beijing, who went blind in 1978 after being infected with tuberculosis bacteria while performing eye surgery. After Teng lost his sight, his girlfriend, a former classmate who is also an optometrist, insisted that they got married. They quickly had a son, but social discrimination led Teng to consider divorce to protect his loved ones from hurt. \"One time, my wife cried in front of me after a colleague told her she was not considered for a promotion because she had to take care of her blind husband,\" he said. \"My son was bullied by classmates many times in kindergarten. They ridiculed him for having a xiazi father, a derogatory term for being blind.\" Teng said a lack of involvement with mainstream society lies at the root of the fear and unfriendly attitudes. \"Only a quarter of this group is employed, and most visually impaired people don't have social lives,\" he said. He noted that the lack of contact has led to unfamiliarity and a sense of fear of the group, who are stereotyped as lonely and dependent. However, greater contact with mainstream society would allow blind and visually impaired people to show how much they can do on their own, which would surprise many people. In addition to their absence in the workplace, China two-track education system means disabled and able-bodied children are largely segregated from primary school through to university, so the two groups rarely get an opportunity to meet. Nie Zhongyuan, a media professional who has directed three television adverts designed to raise awareness of the correct use of accessible facilities for the disabled, said the lack of mainstream contact with blind people creates a vicious circle. \"Though China has made strides to promote inclusion in education and the workplace, the lack of accessible facilities has led to visually impaired and blind people being underrepresented in the public sphere. Their absence exacerbates public ignorance of their conditions and the resulting prejudice,\" said Nie, creative director at Huagan Creative Communication in Nanchang, Jiangxi province. Li Zhen, a blind Braille editor at the China Braille Press, said personal charm matters when starting a relationship, but many visually impaired people lack that quality as a result of poor education and minimal social contact. The most recent available statistics - the Second National Sample Survey on Disability in 2006 - showed that 43.9 percent of disabled people were illiterate, and experts said the rate for the visually impaired is likely to be even higher because their disability affects their access to information. To promote integrated education, China rectified the law related to compulsory education in 2015, ordering mainstream schools to accept disabled students who are deemed capable of receiving a standard education. In the same year, the government made it easier for disabled people to take the gaokao - the national college entrance exam - by requiring examining bodies to offer \"reasonable\" assistance. That means visually impaired examinees must be provided with test papers written in Braille or large-print characters. In addition, last year, China made it illegal for schools to turn away disabled people, a common occurrence in the past. Figures provided by the China Disabled Person's Federation show that almost 30,000 disabled people have been admitted to mainstream universities via the gaokao since 2015. Liang said blind or visually impaired people who study on integrated campuses or are employed in nonsegregated workplaces find it easier to fall in love, because people are less prejudiced about blindness, and \"they are less fearful of the condition if they study or work alongside blind or visually impaired people\".

{"content": "A new exhibition celebrating the Year of the Pig opened to the public at the Capital Museum in Beijing on Tuesday. The first day of Lunar New Year falls on Feb 5 this year. The show, Harmony and Good Harvest, gives glimpses of how the pig has been depicted in Chinese culture through 60 exhibits that illustrate the economic and social aspects of people's association with the animal over time. The pig symbolizes propitiousness and good harvests, and reflects people's yearning for better lives, the show's curator Zheng Hao says. The pig is among the earliest domesticated animals in ancient China and was seen as a symbol of agriculture. The Chinese character jia (home) consists of a common component, baogaitou, which is the upper part of the character that implies a house, and the component shi, the lower part, which refers to pigs. As the composition shows, a settled life with a stable food supply was a major source of happiness for the ancient Chinese. People's opinions of the pig have changed over time. There was a time when people offered pigs as sacrifices to gods and ancestors. Images of pigs often appeared in books or were carved on utensils and used as decorations. However, there was also a time when pigs were perceived as less diligent than cattle and slower than war horses. They were viewed as \"impure and dumb\". The positive view remains mainstream, though. Zhu Bajie, the pig monk from the classic Chinese novel, Journey to the West, has provided an ambivalent image of laziness, gluttony, lust and cowardice mixed with lightheartedness, endurance, loyalty and humor. The figure is indispensable in portraying the pig in Chinese culture, and the exhibition is no exception. Other exhibits include pig figurines made of pottery, porcelain and jade, and royal artifacts with pig motifs.,Some models on display are items that have been unearthed from excavated agricultural sites of the Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 220), such as toilets for humans on top of pigsties. They provide a glimpse of the practical design of ancient livestock rearing. Tomb figures, household items and accessories, as well as modern stamps inspired by the 12 animals of the Chinese zodiac, are also on show, along with interpretations of the related culture. The exhibition runs through March 17. This is the 12th year in a row that the museum is holding a Lunar New Year's exhibition, featuring the animals of the Chinese zodiac, Zheng says. The museum has renewed its permanent exhibitions, including bronze and jade wares, calligraphy and paintings, according to Han Zhanming, the museum's director. Bai Jie, the museum's Party secretary, announced some of the exhibitions under planning for the year at a news conference on Monday. Working together with Beijing's Palace Museum and National Museum of China, as well as the Shanghai Museum, the Liaoning Provincial Museum and the Nanjing Museum in Jiangsu province, the Capital Museum will host an exhibition of more than 100 ancient landscape paintings in September. This year, another exhibition organized through the cooperation of over 20 domestic museums will feature and interpret ancient silk.

{"content": "Beijing will used facial recognition technology to crack down on hospital scalpers, subjecting them to detention and social credit restrictions, the municipal health authority announced on Friday. The municipal Health Commission said about 30 hospitals in the capital have collected visual information on 2,100 suspected hospital scalpers and entered it into their facial recognition systems. The information on the scalpers-many of whom have been fined by the police-includes photographs and ID numbers. If they enter a hospital, they will be monitored. The city government said the commission will take strict steps this year to publish the names of such scalpers and ban them from taking high-speed trains or flights, registering companies or applying for bank loans. Over 900 such scalpers were detained last year during a citywide crackdown. The commission has cooperated with the city's public security bureau to further identify suspected scalpers, and now, with the new technology, an alarm will be triggered if one enters a hospital. The authorities have also strengthened efforts to prevent any cheating on hospital registration apps by severing connections between commercial apps and hospital registration platforms. China has for years been working to address the issue of hospital scalpers. Commonly known as  or yellow bulls, scalpers book appointments in bulk at major public hospitals, preventing genuine patients from doing so. Then they illegally sell the appointments at inflated prices. Those unwilling to pay typically face lengthy hospital waits, potentially putting lives at risk. Huang Xiaojuan, 32, a resident of Beijing, said she could not register at a well-known maternity hospital when she found herself pregnant last year. Her husband found a scalper online and bought a ticket for 3,000 yuan ($447), even though the normal value would be about 200 yuan. \"The scalper traded with my husband in the backyard of the hospital and told him that he could register with any doctor in the hospital if we were willing to pay a higher price,\" Huang said. \"They have a group with several people in charge of different tasks. Some talk to patients like us; some are in charge of relations with doctors and some are just handling the money. They also hire people to line up in front of registration windows if they cannot reach the doctor directly.\" In 2016, Beijing police arrested 12 people for scalping hospital appointment tickets. Many hospitals have set up their own apps for registration to help to reduce scalping. A doctor at Peking University Hospital of Stomatology, who asked not to be named, said there have been virtually no scalpers at the hospital since its app was launched, and most patients choose to register via the app. \"Medical resources are limited,\" the doctor said. \"The app can ensure some equity, since many patients find it hard to register at the window.\" Zhang He, a lawyer at B&D Law Firm in Beijing, said hospital scalpers should face severe punishment and hospitals needed to strengthen their management to prevent the practice.", "overall-label": "tech"}

In the speech, President Xi extended his New Year greetings to Chinese people of all ethnic groups, to compatriots in the Hong Kong SAR, the Macao SAR and Taiwan, to overseas Chinese, as well as to people from all countries and regions around the world. Following are some highlights: President Xi hailed China\u00a1\u00afs achievements in 2017 in his New Year Address, saying that China has embarked on a journey to fully build a modern socialist country. As various initiatives to improve people's livelihoods have been accelerated and the environment has steadily improved, Chinese people have enjoyed a stronger sense of gain, of happiness and of security, Xi said, adding that China has marched one significant step closer to completing the process of building a moderately well-off society in all aspects. He highlighted that there has been a steady flow of technological innovation and major engineering feats in 2017, applauding the creative powers of the Chinese people. Xi said that the year of 2017 marked the 90th anniversary of the founding of the People\u00a1\u00afs Liberation Army, the 20th anniversary of Hong Kong\u00a1\u00afs return to the motherland, and the 80th anniversary of the beginning of nationwide war against Japanese aggression.

{"content": "As the Olympic spotlight shifts to Beijing following the Games in Pyeongchang, the Chinese capital has beefed up efforts to produce a sustainable Winter Olympics in 2022, with its legacy underlined as a key requirement for post-Games success. Since the curtain fell on the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in the Republic of Korea last month, Beijing has taken center stage to prepare for its own version of the sporting gala against the backdrop of a national plan to build a burgeoning winter sports industry leading up to 2022 and beyond. The country's commitment to hosting an excellent Winter Olympics and Paralympics, and using the showcase event as a boost for sporting participation, was highlighted in the annual Government Work Report delivered by Premier Li Keqiang at the opening session of the 13th National People's Congress on March 5. \"China will make thorough preparations for the Beijing Winter Olympics and Paralympics, and multiple channels will be used to raise the number of sporting venues and facilities available to the general public,\" Li said, when he presented the report. Highlighted as a milestone in the country's sporting and social development by the central government, the 2022 Winter Games will be held at three zones\u00a3\u00addowntown Beijing, Yanqing district, in the northwest of the capital, and co-host city Zhangjiakou, Hebei province. The zones are expected to lead sustainable planning and operations, not just for sporting events but for urban development in general, according to deputies and political advisers attending the two sessions. After heated discussions during the National Committee session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, members of the sports panel of the top political advisory body agreed that preevent planning for infrastructure construction, venue management and staff training for the Games should take account of local demand and the environment. \"Even with four years to go until the 2022 Games, we have already started to take into consideration what will happen next after the Games,\" said Li Yingchuan, a CPPCC member and vice-minister of the General Administration of Sport of China, the country's central sporting governing body. \"Since winning the bid for the event, we have instilled the mindset of always considering what will be next and will carry that through the entire preparatory and delivery stages of the Games.\" Yang Yang, a retired Olympic champion speed skater and a member of the Beijing 2022 organizing committee, echoed Li Yingchuan's points, saying that the sustainability featured in the plan for Beijing 2022 is its biggest selling point. \"The International Olympic Committee has put great emphasis on adapting future Games in the hosts' regional development plans,\" said Yang, whose eight-year term as a member of the International Olympic Committee ended last month. \"It is important for us to leave a legacy through practical planning and prudent operation so we can set examples for reform of the IOC.\" Carrying the Olympic flag from Pyeongchang, Beijing wasted no time meshing the gears for 2022, as the organizers announced that construction of all venues and infrastructure is well underway. \"All construction will be completed by the end of next year and will be ready for a series of test events in 2020,\" said Zhang Jiandong, vicemayor of Beijing and executive vice-president of the Beijing 2022 organizing committee. Zhang, who is also an NPC deputy, added that the capital will launch a global competition for the design of the 2022 mascots soon. Although hosting the Olympic Games usually presents a heavy workload, the groundwork for Beijing 2022 will be effortless, thanks to the legacy of the 2008 Summer Olympics. According to the organizing committee, there will be 26 competition and noncompetition venues in the three zones. Of the 12 venues in Beijing's downtown, where all the ice events will be staged, 11 were built for the 2008 Summer Games or earlier events. Landmark 2008 venues, including the National Stadium, better known as the Bird's Nest, the National Aquatics Center, aka the Water Cube, and the Wukesong Arena, will be repurposed to host events such as ice hockey and curling, in addition to acting as media and broadcasting centers in 2022. The only new permanent venue in the Beijing downtown zone will be the National Speed Skating Oval for long-track speed skating, scheduled for completion next year. It will feature post-Olympics operations involving private stakeholders for public skating, hockey games and entertainment events. \"Beijing 2022 can set a new benchmark for sustainable Olympic Games\u00a3\u00adon the one hand benefiting from the legacy of Beijing 2008, while on the other developing your winter sports facilities in a sustainable way,\" said IOC President Thomas Bach during Pyeongchang 2018. As a new competitor and organizer in snow sports, the mainstay of the Winter Olympics, China will face stiff challenges in producing Olympic-standard facilities for snow events in Yanqing and Zhangjiakou by 2022, and ensuring that they are busy after the Games. Though China has set a target to involve 300 million people in winter sports by 2022, the relatively small number of participants at present and a lack of international skiing competitions mean ensuring post-Olympics use of the facilities is a tougher mission than preparing them for the Games. \"Rather than regarding it as a challenge, we'd better embrace it as an opportunity to make up for the lack of winter sports facilities to meet the growing public demand for more diversified exercise activities,\" said Yang, who was appointed chairwoman of the athletes' commission of the Beijing 2022 organizing committee in November. Chongli district in Zhangjiakou, where most of the snow events will be staged, has integrated preparatory work for the Games into a plan to develop the mountainous region\u00a3\u00adhome to seven commercial ski resorts\u00a3\u00adinto a skiing and winter tourism destination. Of the 76 projects for 2022 in the region, 43 are under construction and a further 22 will get underway this year, while work will start on the remaining 11 venues next year, according to Wu Weidong, mayor of Zhangjiakou. \"To not only meet demand for the Games, but also the future industry, we still have to improve a lot in terms of high-level competition management, energy supplies, medical services and accommodation for snow sports,\" said Wu, an NPC deputy. Advisers also stressed that the complexity of venues for highly technical events, such as ski jumping and alpine skiing, requires planning for post-event operations, based on local conditions and international expertise. Citing the ski jumping hills at the training center at the Pajulahti Sports Institute in Finland as an example, Shen Jin, a CPPCC member, said the facility for 2022 should cater for functions other than just the ski jumping event. \"It's always difficult to use the high towers and long ramps after the competition. More options for future use in terms of sightseeing, exhibitions and leisure activities are necessary,\" said Shen, deputy director of the planning and sustainability department of Beijing 2022. The alpine skiing course, which is being built on Xiaohaituo Mountain in Yanqing, needs about 1,300 people for venue management, event services and medical support, but there are few suitable individuals in China, according to Wang Yanxia, deputy director of the sports department of the Beijing 2022 organizing committee. To learn this sophisticated line of work, including producing densely packed artificial snow courses and providing alpine medical services, the committee sent 41 staff members to the IOC's Secondment Program to gain hands-on experience by working alongside local hosts at multiple snow venues during Pyeongchang 2018. \"We can afford to hire experienced staff members from overseas for the 2022 Olympics, which will guarantee operations,\" Wang said. \"But our goal is to take the opportunity to train as many local experts as possible. They will become the human legacy of our winter sports industry.\"", "overall-label": "life-style"}

Xiongan New Area is about 100 kilometers southwest of Beijing. Officials announced on April 1 that it would be set up. The area's priority is to receive Beijing's \"non-capital\" functions, including large enterprises, financial institutions, colleges and research institutions. Since April, many colleges and schools from Beijing have started cooperation or have showed willingness to cooperate with Xiongan. Peking University, one of the most prestigious educational institutions in China, has visited the area and is planning to establish a first-class health center here to do related research, talent training and provide medical services. The university's famed Guanghua School of Management will set up a training center to bolster management studies and techniques. Renmin University of China in Beijing also has started to set up a medical college focusing on traditional Chinese medicine, while Beijing Sport University has proposed establishing a college for sports medicine and recovery in Xiongan.

{"content": "The market size of Chinese K12 (kindergarten through 12th grade) education has doubled in the past five years and the pace is expected to continue in the next five years, according to Edwin Chen, co-head of Asian small/mid-caps research of UBS Securities. The driving force behind the continued growth of Chinese K12 education market can be largely attributed to the country\u00a1\u00afs ongoing urbanization, the second-child policy, rise in income which has resulted in growing demand for differentiated educational resources, and the inadequate supply of public educational resources, said Chen. He also said that over 90 percent of the K12 industry practitioners used to be teachers working at public schools, or those working for small-sized studios. Major industry players such as Beijing-headquartered New Oriental Education and Technology Group and Beijing-based Tomorrow Advancing Life accounted for less than 10 percent of the market share. Even though in first-tier cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, these two industry leaders only took up 15 percent and 12 percent of the local K12 education market share respectively. \u00a1\u00b0But the trend for 2018 and the next few years is that such large educational groups will see their market share increase, as the central government tightens its grip on the regulation of public school teachers taking other posts at other institutions,\u00a1\u00b1 he said. With their market share further consolidating, the leading educational groups will probably reach into other courses which they did not touch upon in the past and reach for students of other age groups to seek more rapid growth. While a large number of public educational companies have been discussing about the adoption of artificial intelligence technology into educational scenarios, the use of this technology is still confined to preliminary attempts such as face recognition.

{"content": "On the night Liu Jinsong approached Yueyang in Hunan province, he admits he was a bit scared. The streetlights were dim and the road hilly and pebbly, with barely visible sections under repair looming here and there as he rode toward his first destination on a marathon mountain bike trip, his figure dwarfed by the trucks and tractors that roared past. Liu, 46, had set out that morning, on April 26, from his hometown in Changsha, the capital of Hunan, bound for Moscow, more than 11,000 kilometers away. Why Moscow? The 2018 FIFA World Cup is being held in Russia, with the final in the capital on July 15, and Liu is a soccer fan. \"I've always wanted to relate to the World Cup in my own way,\" Liu said. \"I can always show up in the stadium easily as long as I have money, but that's not my way.\" Liu fixed his eyes on his bike, bought a year ago but left in a corner because he was busy running his little barbecue restaurant. Cycling to Russia would be difficult, but also fun and unique, he thought. \"I'm also a fan of rock music, and my understanding of rock is to follow you heart,\" he said. \"If I think about doing it, then I will do it. That way my heart remains the same, even if I fail to complete the task.\" After three days repairing and preparing his bike, Liu left his business, wife and son behind and hit the road on a drizzly morning, with no prior physical training or route planning. Smiling and motivated, he took pictures in front of his barbecue restaurant and announced his departure on social media. Liu cycled past the Yangtze River and across vast canola plains, but the journey was far tougher than he expected. Five days after setting out he had serious bruises on his thighs and a strained tendon in his left leg, and he had to push his bike some of the time. He reached Beijing on May 8, planning to collect his passport, Russian visa and credit card while taking a brief rest. The two-day break in Beijing, sharing a few drinks with friends, rejuvenated him. He said his body had grown accustomed to long-distance cycling and it would be no problem to stay in the saddle for more than 10 hours at a time. But the adventure beyond Beijing was a journey into the unknown. \"I have no idea how and where I'll stay next or if I will be able to find accommodation or food along the way, but it is these unknown things that make traveling most interesting,\" he said. On May 12, Liu ran into heavy rain that later turned into hailstones, forcing him to stop and seek shelter. As the night wore on, his GPS guided him onto a narrow country road, with the nearest hotel 100 km away. A few dogs barked aggressively when he attempted to pitch his tent in a village, so he set it up in a clearing in front of an old temple, falling asleep with the chanting of monks as a lullaby. On day 28, with 3,300 km conquered, Liu reached the China-Russia border at Manzhouli, in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region, and crossed into a foreign country for the first time in his life. Siberia was vast, but not flat, and the rough roads posed a constant risk of punctures to his tires. Wild animals could have been lurking in the primeval forest and valleys, but Liu was too tired to think about the danger. \"I've lost track of time,\" he said. \"I never want to stop, I'm just a bit tired and sleepy.\" Luckily, the people Liu met on the way greeted him warmly, offsetting Siberia's chilly winds. He was offered cozy bedrooms more than once by Russian villagers when he was about to pitch his tent in the cold. He was also offered a ride by a truck driver when the road was too bad for cycling in the dark. The time Liu spent with his new Russian friends forged memories as strong as the vodka they offered him. Liu is still heading to Moscow at full speed, averaging 160 km a day. He will make it to Moscow on July 15 if all goes as planned and will see if anyone is kind enough to give him a free ticket to the final. \"At this stage watching the World Cup is no longer necessary,\" he said. \"I will be satisfied just to feel the World Cup vibes.\" Liu's social media posts on his journey have earned him the criticism of some netizens, because his journey has led to the closure of his restaurant, with his wife and son alone at home. He said he plans to start his business all over again and spend more time with his family after he flies home. \"I'm not trying to prove anything to anyone,\" he said. \"I just want to do it, and I believe I can.\"", "overall-label": "life-style"}

These traditions were passed down to new generations through artists and craftsmen who have devoted themselves to honing and teaching folk art. And now, they are sharing these traditions with some new friends. By using some dried corn husks, straws and a pair of scissors, Tunde, a travelling Hungarian folk artisan, showed the visitors how she turned trash into treasure. \"The people who live in villages, they grow corn and use all parts of the plant,\" she said. \"For example, the children would make toys from the leaves, ladies would make baskets ...something they could use in the kitchen or just around the house.\"Depending on the shape and design of the piece, it can be hung, taped, or placed anywhere to boost the holiday spirit.

We are very optimistic about the deals during CIIE. We hope to showcase our leading smart building technologies, products and solutions to China and the rest of the world through such an important international platform. We look forward to and welcome engagements with visitors and guests from all over the world. We also further hope that the inaugural CIIE will be a kick start that we enter a period of rapid growth in the Chinese market. As an MNC, the Chinese market has always been one of the rapidly grow regions worldwide. We are committed to introducing advanced technologies and products into China while also maintaining our investments and innovations in China. CIIE is an important international platform that offers us an opportunity to listen to customers' needs and feedback in addition to business deals. We'll be well motivated to further strengthen our technology capabilities, develop and promote new products to better serve China and the global market. China's reform and opening-up have achieved tremendous success during the past four decades. We believe that the pursuit to further opening-up will never rest. Urban competitiveness will be tightly put on the agenda as China opens up further. Issues closely related to urban competitiveness such as environment conservation, energy-saving, emission-reduction and high-efficiency operation all present outstanding opportunities for our growth. Meanwhile, with more international talents coming to China, significant support will be witnessed as we strive to serve our customers better and achieve growth. With the goal of completing the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects being achieved by 2020, the progress of urbanization will be accelerated in next three years. How to boost the urbanization through green building and city development will be the key issue that we watch for. The '13th Five-Year plan for the Development of Building Energy Efficiency and Green Buildings'\" clearly stated that by 2020, the energy efficiency level of new urban buildings will increase by 20 percent compared with 2015, and the proportion of green building area in new urban construction will exceed 50 percent. Faced with the potential problems such as conflicts between people and land, more efforts are required to \"green\" the new buildings and retrofit existing buildings in cities. Retrofitting business is strategically positioned as part of our business focus in China. It will be crucial for refreshing the huge amount of existing buildings especially in the tier-one cities of China.,We are pleased to be one of the first companies to sponsor and participate in the CIIE, where people will see our latest innovations, including materials that enable smarter homes and more efficient cars, better ways of connecting in the digital world, supporting active and healthy lifestyles, better protection for workers and solutions that support a circular economy. Our booth is in the High-end Intelligent Equipment area.

We believe the expo will be positive for promoting partnerships and encouraging global growth. It provides enterprises with a platform to present themselves to China and the world, and is expected to accelerate the continuous investment and development of foreign enterprises in the Chinese market. DuPont will continue to bring more innovative technologies and products to better serve the infrastructure of Chinese society and enrich people's living standards. China's reform and opening have provided a good business environment for us. We have successfully established over 40 wholly owned companies and joint ventures here, hiring more than 3,400 people. In 2005, we opened the DuPont China R&D Center, which we expanded in 2013. To better understand local customers' needs and challenges, we opened our DuPont Innovation Center in Shanghai in 2014. To meet our customers' growing demands, in 2017 we announced a production capacity increase at our Shenzhen facility for DuPont Transportation & Advanced Polymers. We expect it to go into full production by the end of 2019. And we also are increasing the production capacity of our health and nutrition facility in northern China. China has always been an important and fast-growing market, and is an important part of our global strategy. The Chinese government has recently re-emphasized orderly relaxing of market access, the improving of relevant laws on foreign capital and strengthening the protection of intellectual property. The various initiatives in reform, opening up, and economic development are the hallmarks of China's growing economy and the foundation for building sustainable international business cooperation. By continuously upgrading and facilitating the foreign investment policy, we believe China will continue to be a popular destination for foreign-invested enterprises.,Faurecia will bring our most advanced and cutting-edge technologies to CIIE, based on two innovation directions: Smart Life on Board and Sustainable Mobility.

The convening of CIIE also indicates China\u00a1\u00afs determination to free trade and multilateralism. Since the implementation of the reform and opening-up policy, the Chinese automotive industry has embarked on the fast track of development to become the world\u00a1\u00afs largest auto market. Looking ahead, the further opening-up of China will unleash new potential for the industry, driven by more bilateral and multilateral cooperation between MNCs and local enterprises. MNCs like Faurecia expect to seize new growth opportunities amid a fair and sound business environment. We will adhere to our China Priority strategy while actively engaging in the upgrade of the industry. CIIE also provides us with a perfect platform to expand the Open Innovation Ecosystem in China with academic research institutions, industry associations and start-ups to activate innovation capabilities. Meanwhile, improved environment for intellectual property protection also gives us stronger confidence to expand technology cooperation with related organization in China. Since entering the Chinese market in 1992, Faurecia has witnessed and been deeply involved in the process of China\u00a1\u00afs reform and opening-up. In the new era, China\u00a1\u00afs economy is in transformation, shifting from focus on speed to quality. This includes the auto industry. Faurecia believes China will develop toward a more open and dynamic economy. We\u00a1\u00afll seize new opportunities to expand our investment and deepen cooperation locally. At the Boao Forum, a series of further opening-up policies were announced that included easing foreign equity restrictions, broadening China\u00a1\u00afs market access and lowering tariffs on imports goods, which also have direct reflection to automotive industry. Foreign auto companies are also encouraged to establish R&D centers in China, pushing forward reform of the industry. Benefiting from the national policy, Faurecia is expanding cooperation with local OEMs, establishing joint ventures with ChangAn, Dongfeng, BYD and Liuzhou Wuling to co-develop innovative solutions. We also signed a strategic partnership agreement with China FAW Group to elevate our cooperation to a new height. Faurecia keeps faith in the great prospect of China\u00a1\u00afs economic development in the coming years. First, the innovation-driven development strategy and further opening-up policy will fully invigorate the economy in the long run. China is setting its sights on becoming a technology and innovation leader, particularly in the domains of Internet of Things, zero emissions and artificial intelligence. Chinese OEMs are already pioneering technology innovation in many aspects, such as autonomous driving and HMI, which will drive sustainable development of the auto industry in the next three years. In addition, China will continue to adjust industry structure and build a modernized economic system to cushion downward pressure and remain steady economic growth. We believe the structural upgrade of the Chinese economy will also further the high-quality development in advanced manufacturing sectors with more demand for innovative products, which will generate more opportunities for us to leverage our expertise in the local market.,ZEISS Group will bring exhibits spanning Research Microscopy Solutions, Industrial Quality Solutions, Medical Technology and Vision Care/Consumer Products areas at the same stage in China for the first time.

In addition, the CIIE promotes economic globalization that is open, inclusive, comprehensively beneficial, balanced and win-win, building an open world economy and promoting global trade growth. That\u00a1\u00afs a good signal for us multinationals to keep developing in the China market with the improving business environment. China\u00a1\u00afs sustained efforts to deepen reform, and improve the investment environment for foreign companies allow multinational enterprises to evolve and diversify in China. ZEISS\u00a1\u00afs history in China dates back to 1957. From entering as a trading company to establishing regional headquarters for sales, manufacturing and innovation, ZEISS\u00a1\u00afs growth in China is aligned with the China market trends of being more open, inclusive and dynamic, thanks to the reform and opening-up policy. Since the establishment of the Shanghai FTZ (a symbol of China\u00a1\u00afs reform and opening-up), a substantial number of measures have been announced to further simplify the administrative process in many critical areas such as trade, tax and financial services. These have enabled ZEISS to increase our efficiency and lower costs to stay competitive in the Chinese market. For example, we have already achieved substantial improvements in inbound and outbound dispatching speed, with improvements of over 30 percent in reduction of working and processing time. In recent years, China's market has been continuously expanding in size and increasing market opportunities. Thanks to China's booming market, we have been able to leverage our strengths in global technical resources, diversified solutions and industry experience to carry out all-around cooperation with our partners. Alongside the country\u00a1\u00afs stabilized economy, the government\u00a1\u00afs plan is to push for high-quality social and industrial development.

This is actually offering us a lot of growth opportunities as ZEISS is primarily active in healthcare, research, vision care and industrial quality. These are all sectors of the Chinese economy that are growing above the average. With full confidence in China\u00a1\u00afs long-term economic prosperity and vibrancy, ZEISS will take concrete action to fully integrate into the local ecosystem and grow with the Chinese market.,At the exhibition, Infineon showcases a vision for the life of tomorrow as our corporate slogan is \"Part of your life. Part of tomorrow\". We focus on the main topics \"smart car\", \"smart city\", \"smart factory\" and \"smart home\". We have live-action and interactive features at the booth, demonstrating how Infineon connects the real and digital world with advanced semiconductor technologies that make life easier, safer and greener. And I expect very fruitful meetings with customers at the CIIE. To name a few things we exhibit: There is an award-winning smart lighting solution that will make our cities smarter. And we have a really smart car, the Audi A8. Infineon supplies key components. The Audi A8 is the world's first series production car featuring level 3 automated driving. CIIE is a great opportunity for Infineon to demonstrate our technology leadership to a broader audience. It also helps to enhance our communications with local government and strengthen our collaboration with Chinese partners. We are convinced that it can bring attractive business opportunities to all of us. In the past few months, Infineon has been very active in participating CIIE related activities and that enabled us to yield fast and tangible results. I am very excited to tell you that we have already secured some business opportunities with local customers and I am quite looking forward to signing the deals at CIIE. Infineon is a world leader in semiconductors. The semiconductor industry requires heavy investments, and the making of a semiconductor usually involves several countries, tens of thousands of miles travelled and almost a few weeks' transit. So a fair trade and investment environment and an efficient global ecosystem would be essential. CIIE underlines China's strong commitment to open its door wider for trade and investment, and its great efforts to enhance cross-industry collaboration and communications. I am convinced that will eventually help drive our industry development. China's reform and opening-up policy has led to an impressive economic development. Infineon has been honored to witness, contribute to, and benefit from this policy. Since the establishment of the first entity in Wuxi in 1995, Infineon's business has been growing rapidly. With a turnover of 1,735 million euros, China accounted for about 25 percent of Infineon's revenue in the fiscal year of 2017. Infineon has established an entire value chain serving the Chinese market, covering R&D, manufacturing, sales, marketing and technical support. Our commitment to China is strong. We've been expanding our investment, and collaborating with local partners to drive industry development and transformation. For instance, we built a second factory in Wuxi in 2015 to offer stronger support to the rapid-growing local market; and in 2018, we joined hands with SAIC Motor to establish a joint venture to accelerate the growth of electro-mobility. In addition, we collaborated with Alibaba Cloud and JD.com on the development of Internet of Things; and with Tsinghua University for talent development. China has made great progress on its attempt of transforming the economy since President Xi Jinping came up with the concept of \"New Normal\". Looking into the next three years, I think \"high quality development\" will continue to be the major focus. As the economy develops, our society faces some challenges: the ever-growing population and the rising demand for energy. At the same time, the need to fight climate change calls for new solutions in our everyday life. How to connect the dots between economy and ecology will be the key issues that I will be watching for. Infineon is committed to addressing such challenges and contributing to China \"high quality development\", with our technologies that make life easier, safer and greener.,In addition to introducing Schindler's history, milestones and values, we will highlight our new technology solution \u00a8C Schindler Ahead \u00a8C which can connect all elevators, escalators and moving walks to the Internet, capture real-time data and use big data analysis and AI to predict maintenance needs. It can fundamentally change the existing way of maintenance and repair, providing better, more reliable service to customers, property management companies and end-users as well. Moreover, we will showcase the spirit of craftsmanship and quality which we have inherited from over 140 years since its foundation of Schindler in Switzerland in 1874. As one of the world's leading providers of elevators, escalators, moving walks and related services including installation, maintenance and modernization, Schindler was invited by the Chinese government to be part of this world-level gala. Our escalators and elevators move over 1 billion people per day. However, the fourth industrial revolution is now coming, we are looking for more cross-industry cooperation opportunities and we also want to use this stage to make the public be aware of Schindler's leading technology \u00a8C Schindler Ahead, an innovative piece of Internet of Things \u00a8C to achieve smart unban mobility. Schindler has been very active in infrastructure projects in China, like airports, metro lines, etc. A number of our customers in China over the last few years have expanded their business to other countries in Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa to participant in the Belt and Road Initiative. We believe CIIE will become one of the important factors of energizing modern industry's development. Schindler established the first Sino-Western industrial joint venture in 1980, just after the Chinese government announced the opening up and reforms of the economy. We are proud that we are growing together with Chinese economy and we are one of the first foreign companies to have contributed to and benefited from China's reform and opening up. During the past three decades, Schindler has built up its reputation of safety and good quality. We have won string market share in China. Many of our reference projects are well-known, such as, Shanghai Tower, 2010 Expo China Pavilion, China World Trade Center Tower 3, National Stadium, Shenzhen Tencent Tower, Shenzhen Ping An Tower etc. Despite the uncertainty of global economy, we are still confident in China's future economy. Schindler has frequently said that China is the \"second planet\" for Schindler. With the opening of the new escalator plant in 2014 and elevator plant in 2015 in Shanghai's Jiading district, and the relocation of Schindler Zone China head offices to Schindler City in Jiading in September 2016, Schindler is committed to providing leading technologies and excellent services to China market for a long run. As for the elevator and escalator industry, we will pay more attentions to the opportunities and challenges brought about by urbanization and aging population as well as aging buildings. Furthermore, the desire of Chinese people to improve their living conditions due to their increasing incomes has drawn our attentions in these years and this will be continued in the upcoming.,Novo Nordisk will display publicly available product information of 9 innovative medicines that are launched in China and are benefiting Chinese patients. This includes a new generation of long-acting insulin Tresiba and growth hormone Norditropin, both launched in China in 2018, as well as Victoza which entered the National Reimbursement Drug List in 2017. In addition, Novo Nordisk will also showcase several research literatures on new drugs that are launched overseas and are planned to be marketed in China in the future. We will also dedicate space in our exhibits to highlight the high prevalence of diabetes in China, the importance of early diagnosis and early and better treatment for better clinical outcome as well as an international initiative called Cities Changing Diabetes. We hope through our efforts to raise awareness of diabetes, its negative impact to health and social-economic burden if not managed well and to rally stakeholders in both public and private sectors to continue changing diabetes together. Novo Nordisk hopes to showcase our efforts, contributions and unwavering commitments to change diabetes in China for the past 24 years. We target to let more people understand the threat of diabetes and its heavy economic burden on society which encourages stakeholders to work together with us to change diabetes. We also expect to learn about the latest products, services, and ideas brought by pharmaceutical peers; understand the development of Internet technology, big data, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things and 5G, and their application to the pharmaceutical industry. In addition, we will also pay attention to the development of manufacturing, financial services, and logistics, as they will also have an important impact on our business. Yes. The China International Import Expo provides an open platform for all countries and major pharmaceutical companies to showcase themselves, exchange ideas and seek cooperation. Through this platform, we manage to learn about the latest products, services, ideas of pharmaceutical peers, understand the development of other technical fields, and apply new technologies to the pharmaceutical industry. Novo Nordisk will continue to work with the government and the healthcare community to promote awareness of diabetes and healthy lifestyle. On the other hand, we will integrate China into our global R&D system, and aim to realize simultaneous clinical research, new drug registration application and approval between China and the world, so that patients in China and access to our innovative medicines simultaneously as patients in other countries. In the next seven to eight years, Novo Nordisk plan to bring 10 innovative medicines to the Chinese market in various disease areas. China's pledge to further open up its market to foreign companies tremendously improves the economic development in China, making the Chinese market one of the most attractive markets in the world. The continuous open-up leads the healthcare industry to the direction of encouraging innovation, focusing on quality and emphasizing efficiency. We welcome this positive trend. Tresiba, which was launched in China in March this year, is a new generation of ultra-long-acting basal insulin analogue. It was in the fast-track priority review list during the drug approval process of the State Food and Drug Administration of China. As a result, the review and approval process of Tresiba was significantly accelerated. We take a quite positive attitude towards China's economy in the next three years. China is Novo Nordisk's second-largest market. To us, China market offers us a long-term growth opportunity. Our growth rate reached 6 percent last year and we aim to continue growing our business in next three years. China faces huge challenge from diabetes. According to China's Rules of Halves (the statistics report by IDF): more than 114 million people with diabetes, less than half of them know that, and around one-third receives treatment, and only about 13 percent of people with diabetes in China are being treated and effectively managing their diabetes. Fortunately, if we can achieve early diagnosis and better treatment, we will be able to help patient achieve optimal outcome and more patients can live normal lives with good quality.,In terms of performance materials, Merck has display solutions, surface solutions and semiconductors solutions.

For the life sciences industry, Merck will present research, process and applied solutions and products, including Crispr (gene editing technology), lab water systems, cell counting and sterile sampling equipment, as well as a virtual reality system for customers to experience Merck's latest life science products and solutions. Merck decided to participate in CIIE for three reasons. The first is to showcase leading products and technologies from all our businesses - healthcare, life science and performance materials. The second is to strengthen relationships and dialogue with our Chinese partners. We value our partnerships with Chinese customers and the government and see the Expo as an opportunity to deepen and broaden those relationships. Thirdly, Merck is a company with a deep tradition in innovation. We've had many break-through products in our 350-year history. We launched our innovation hubs in February this year in China. The expo is a great platform to look for innovation partners, ideas and cross-sector opportunities that will ultimately lead to more breakthroughs for China. Industry upgrades are happening in every sector we are in. CIIE is not only a stage for companies to demonstrate products and technologies but also a platform for partners to build dialogues. It will help create understanding and shape future industry development. CIIE also comes at a really good time when we are in face of confusion about world trade. China is an important country for Merck, we're very committed to the country and look forward to further growth and opportunities to come. For Merck, China's opening-up has been transformative, creating tremendous demand and new opportunities across all our businesses. Take for example the pharmaceutical industry: urbanization, an aging population, and increased healthcare awareness have combined to create a surge of healthcare demand. At the same time China is becoming more open to new ideas and investors. These factors lead to China's demand for new medicines, new solutions and new ways of thinking. China aims to become the world' largest producer of displays and semiconductors. This ambition has positive implications for our Performance Materials business. Chinese manufacturers use our materials to give them a competitive edge in the world market. We are growing solidly along with our partners in all these areas. Our life science business is also seeing strong growth, driven by China's transformation from labor-intensive manufacturing to an innovation-driven economy. This shift is pushing investment dollars \u00a8C both for Merck and industrywide \u00a8C into research and R&D, which is great for our life science business. As a company operating in China for 85 years, Merck has great confidence in China's economy in the future. According to the \"13th Five-Year\" plan (2016-2020), China has strong needs in areas of healthcare, high quality food and drugs and solutions on environment protection where Merck can contribute with our products and innovations. Moreover, China is to transform from labor/manufacturing intensive development to innovation driven economy. This trend created a lot of investment on research, which leads to the fast development of our Life Science business here. Our commitment to China will not be changed in the foreseeable future and we will keep investing in every sector. We are also excited about what we're seeing in terms of Chinese innovation: from e-commerce to biosimilars development, it's having a big impact on our strategy. That is why we decided to open Merck innovation hubs in China.,Through our CIIE exhibition, we aim to showcase our full product portfolio from our diverse segments, ranging from pet care to confectionery/snacks and food.

{"content": "China's use of natural gas surged by 19 percent in 2017, as areas across northern China switched to this relatively clean fossil fuel and away from highly polluting coal in residential heating and industrial uses, according to data from the former Ministry of Environmental Protection, now called the Ministry of Ecology and Environment. This enabled those in Beijing and surrounding areas to enjoy many clear, blue-sky days this past winter, in sharp contrast with the heavy air pollution seen just a year ago. Increased use of natural gas is a key part of plans to reach the national priority goals of creating an ecological civilization and higher-quality growth. These goals were stressed at the recent two sessions meetings of the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Beijing. Air pollution in northern China is usually worse in the winter, but this past winter saw unprecedented improvement. Largely due to the policy decision to shift to natural gas for heating and many industrial uses, the average concentration in Beijing of the most hazardous small particulate matter, PM2.5, fell in January by 70 percent year-on-year to 34 micrograms per cubic meter, the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau said in a statement. It was the first time the figure was under the national standard safe level of 35, the bureau said. However, recent weeks have seen many days of high air pollution, although coming weeks are forecast to be clear. From October to January, all 28 cities in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, also known as Jing-Jin-Ji, and surrounding areas saw winter air quality improve. For example, Shijiazhuang in Hebei province saw a decrease of 52.4 percent. Jining in neighboring Shandong province saw the smallest decrease, 8.4 percent, according to the ministry. \"The dramatic improvement in air quality mainly resulted from effective and tougher controls on emissions and advantageous weather to disperse pollutants,\" said Li Xiang, director of air quality management at the capital's Environmental Protection Bureau. Restrictions covered many sources, such as factories, vehicles and the burning of coal, she said, adding that more than 11,000 polluting companies were closed or moved. In 2013, Premier Li Keqiang announced goals to reduce pollution throughout the country. This was a fundamental change of direction from the previous emphasis solely on rapid GDP growth. Since then, policies to shift toward cleaner industry and energy brought down the average concentration of PM2.5 by almost 40 percent from 2013 in the Jing-Jin-Ji region. In Beijing, the average concentration of PM2.5 went down from 89.5 micrograms per cubic meter in 2013 to 58 mcg per cu m for the entire year of 2017\u00a3\u00adbelow the target of 60 set out when the campaign was launched and 36 percent below the 2013 level of 90. Throughout China, 338 cities saw an average reduction of 6.5 percent from 2016 levels. Recent research by the Energy Policy Institute of Chicago estimates that the reductions in air pollution since 2013 add 3.3 years to life expectancy in Beijing and, in Hebei province, 4.5 years in Baoding and 5.3 years in Shijiazhuang.,This year's rapid shift from coal to natural gas has led to shortages. According to the Ministry of Environmental Protection, around 100,000 families and some schools temporarily lacked heat in December. The government stepped in with a combination of measures, including allowing some additional use of coal and moving natural gas from industrial uses to residential and from southern China to the north. The National Development and Reform Commission also ordered Beijing to restart a coal-fired power plant that had been shut down in March last year. Natural gas prices soared in December. The price of liquefied natural gas in China jumped from 4,000 yuan ($605) per metric ton to more than 10,000 yuan per ton. However, the price was brought down to 5,613.6 yuan per ton by mid-January, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics. Han Xiaoping, chief information officer of China Energy Net Consulting, said the current natural gas shortage is due to insufficient domestic gas resources and the lack of distributed gas storage infrastructure, especially underground storage tanks. In addition to building more natural gas infrastructure, the strategy for alleviating future shortages is to concentrate natural gas use in residential and industrial uses, where it makes the most difference in reducing pollution. The modern ultra-supercritical coal-fired electrical power plants that China is building are not as clean as natural gas turbines, but they are far cleaner than the very small burners, so it is seen as making sense to concentrate coal mostly in electrical power generation, as is now done in developed countries. Lauri Myllyvirta, a coal and air pollution expert at Greenpeace in Beijing, said: \"Shifting small boilers or household heating from coal to gas definitely leads to big air quality gains. That is the sector where natural gas makes most sense in China. If you look at what happened in the last winter, the local policies were very focused on gas. In the next years, the policy is more balanced between geothermal, biomass, electric heating and gas. I definitely think that that broader mix, including emissions-free sources as well, will be better and might avoid some of the problems we saw this winter.\" He also said that the government's 2021 heating plan, which stiffens building insulation standards, will require retrofitting the insulation of rural houses, so gas demand from heating will decline. This ties in with the broader policy of upgrading industrial transformation. \"If you think about where China is at right now, there is a need to scale down construction and the reliance on infrastructure projects and real estate to drive growth. At this point, training some of the people in the construction sector to do retrofits would make an enormous amount of sense,\" Myllyvirta said.,The most direct beneficiaries of the switch from coal to natural gas for rural heating and industry are the villagers and workers who no longer have to work with coal or breathe its emissions. Michal Meidan, vice-president for research at Energy Aspects, a London-based energy consulting company, said: \"Natural gas is a big improvement over coal in terms of pollution but also in terms of worker safety. Worker accidents and mining accidents all have been rampant and a source of concern for many years. By switching to natural gas, you get fewer accidents in the industrial workplace. You don't need the big piles of coal you did to fuel furnaces.\" Myllyvirta, of Greenpeace, said: \"In the winter, we know that heating is an important source of outdoor pollution affecting cities and so on. But the biggest health impact of heating with coal is the indoor pollution of people living in houses where coal is used for heating and cooking. Beijing's average PM2.5 is now around 60 (micrograms per cubic meter). If you heat with coal, you easily have several hundreds or even more than 1,000 inside your house.\" According to the World Health Organization, local smog in general\u00a3\u00adwhich leads to increased risk of stroke, heart disease, asthma, and lung cancer\u00a3\u00adconsists of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and dust and other particles. Also, carbon dioxide emissions lead to global warming, though they are not locally harmful. Sulfur dioxide is created mostly by burning coal. Nitrogen oxides, and the ground-level ozone that is created when they interact with sunlight, come mostly from motor vehicles. Dust and other particles are made airborne largely by construction, truck traffic or wind from desert areas. Natural gas is much cleaner than coal, both globally and locally. Locally, it produces almost no sulfur dioxide and less nitrogen oxides than is created by gasoline or diesel engines. Recent analysis by a team at Peking University's Guanghua School of Management concluded that, by the end of 2017, the switch from coal to natural gas and electricity in the Beijing area was successful in nearly eliminating the sulfur dioxide pollution from coal, but little progress had been made against nitrogen oxides. Chen Songxi, a professor at Guanghua, described the conclusions of a forthcoming publication: \"The move from coal to natural gas is reflected in the dramatic, roughly 50 percent, falls in sulfur dioxide levels throughout the region since 2013. This was true in highly industrialized towns as well as in Beijing. Beijing's level already reached single digits in 2016, in the summer and spring, which is very close to European cities. Liu Baoxian, deputy director of the Beijing Environmental Monitoring Center, said, \"The average annual concentration of sulfur dioxide saw a historical low of only 8 micrograms per cubic meter\"\u00a3\u00adfar below the national standard of 60. On the other hand, Chen said, \"The other component of PM2.5 is nitrogen oxides, mostly from car emissions. We have seen little change in it. The other thing we see in the region is that the ozone level has been going up significantly. The number of cars in Beijing has pretty much leveled off but is not being decreased.\",The winter of 2017 was a perfect storm for natural gas. For example, gas shipments from Turkmenistan fell by 32 percent from September to November, which could not be made up by volume from Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, according to China's customs authority. In addition, a large Sinopec liquefied natural gas terminal in Tianjin did not become ready for commercial shipments until this month. Domestic production of natural gas increased by 10.5 percent, while imports made up the difference, growing by 28.9 percent. As of 2016, China's gas came from 60 percent domestic production and 40 percent imports, but the central government expects imports to grow to 50 percent by 2020. Imports consist of liquid natural gas, imported by ship, and pipelines, currently mostly from Central Asian countries. A new pipeline from Russia is expected to bring natural gas to Northeast China and to Shanghai by 2020. However, LNG is abundantly available and can provide flexible supply\u00a3\u00adespecially once receiving terminals and underground storage capacity are completed. In 2017, LNG took a bigger share of the imports. China imported 68 million metric tons in 2017\u00a3\u00adof which 38 million tons was LNG and 30 million tons was from pipelines. The previous year, the total was 54 million tons, of which 26 million tons was LNG and 27 million tons from pipelines, according to Meidan, of Energy Aspects. China's LNG imports surpassed those of South Korea to become the world's second-largest after Japan. According to Marc Howson, director of the LNG market at S&P Global Platts, a further increase to 50 million metric tons is expected in 2018. Australia is the major supplier, followed by Qatar, Malaysia, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. The US Energy Information Agency estimates that China has huge supplies of unconventional shale gas, about equal to those of the US and Canada combined. However, extraction of that gas is still in the early stages. \"Sinopec is developing shale with quite good results in Chongqing, producing 5 billion to 7 billion cubic meters of gas, quite a good accomplishment,\" said Meidan. \"However, the geology is still unclear, and therefore the technological needs and the pricing environment are all open questions. Even the US shale revolution that essentially took off in 2000 and reached a dramatic increase in output within five years was almost 20 years in the making\u00a3\u00adthousands of wells had been drilled by private firms, backed by various government incentive schemes. And when shale took off, natural gas prices were high enough to sustain development efforts.\" Natural gas use is expected to grow to 10 percent of China's total energy mix, up from around 7 percent now. Combined with an even stronger emphasis on anti-pollution enforcement, it will be a key component of a cleaner mix of energy use and upgraded industry. Emphasizing that air pollution control doesn't conflict with the effort of developing the economy and improving people's lives, Wang Guoqing, spokesman for the first session of 13th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said: \"Development with high emissions and pollution affects not only long-term economic development, but also people's health. That is not the development we want.\"", "overall-label": "politics"}
{"content": "A set of Chinese children's literature classics was published in Beijing last week. \"This is the first time that Chinese children's literature has been published in a systematic way, and it will fill a gap in the market,\" says Zhang Gaoli, the editor-in-chief of China Translation & Publishing House. The 16 books were published on Aug 22 to coincide with the Beijing International Book Fair. Children's literature is a thriving genre, yet only a handful of Chinese children literature writers are known in the world at large. These include Cao Wenxuan, the first Chinese winner of the Hans Christian Andersen award, and the nationally acclaimed children's storyteller Yang Hongying. \"We chose the most attractive stories from a range of modern Chinese children's literature,\" says Zhang. \"They reflect the core values and life of Chinese families.\" The set comprises eight works and their English translations covering influential Chinese children's literature writers such as Jin Bo and Wu Meizhen. To ensure the quality of translation, the publisher says, it employed more than 10 translators and proofreaders, most of whom are scholars or have spent years doing Chinese translation studies. The project took two years to complete. Each book includes illustrations and a QR Code on the back cover that gives access to audio tracks of the stories that can be heard on phone. Speaking about the work, Wang Quangen, chief editor of the series and a professor at Beijing Normal University, says: \"Children's literature reflects truth, virtue and beauty common to all nations, so it has no borders.\" Wei Yushan, the head of the China Academy of Press and Publication, says: \"It's not just for children in Western countries, but also for Chinese children growing up overseas. \"The stories are rooted in traditional culture. They are like breast milk for these children to sustain their bond with their motherland.\" Children's literature was one of the highlights of the Beijing book fair, held from Aug 22 to 26, with a special section for children held for the first time. Meanwhile, Dang Dang, an online shopping platform in China, says it sold 410 million children's titles last year, 60 percent more than in 2016. The value of sales of children's literature books alone was 1 billion yuan ($146 million), accounting for 18 percent of the value of children's book sales, it says. Xue Tao, one of the writers whose work is included in the series, says that purity and love among other characteristics of children's stories touch readers regardless of their race or nationality. His book September Glacier featured in the series is set on the China-Russia border and tells the story of a Chinese boy, a Russian boy and a dog befriending one another and experiencing joy and pain together. Explaining the significance of the series, Zhang says: \"With the Belt and Road Initiative, people in many countries are keen to learn about Chinese culture. So the demand for Chinese literature is rising. \"And we plan to tap into the demand by translating our children's stories into more languages.\" In March, Zhang attended the Bologna Children's Book Fair in Italy, where China was the main guest country. Speaking about the future, Zhang says he is delighted that Chinese children's literature is at last gaining international recognition, but adds that he is aware of the long road ahead as China looks to internationalize such literature in the way that many Western countries have. \"The gap lies in the way we present our stories. \"We clearly have great stories to tell, but we need to better combine form and content, such as the way we use images and audio, and develop these stories into copyright material.\" For now, China Translation& Publishing House has set up 16 China-themed international editorial departments to improve how it selects what it wants to publish. \"Chinese children's literature mirrors the values of the Chinese nuclear family,\" says Zhang. \"It represents our characteristics and attitudes to life and nature. \"We hope the publication of this bilingual set of children's books not only introduces our culture to the world, but also gives people a useful perspective as they observe China and learn about it.\"", "overall-label": "life-style"}

Well, it's maybe a bit of both. All aboard a high-speed train hurtling across the Chinese landscape at speeds up to 300 kilometers an hour! During this nine-minute video, the coin kept its balance, prompting a surge in online viewers worldwide. Some took to performing similar experiments on high-speed trains in their own countries\u00a1\u00ad with varying levels of success! Although the Japanese high-speed train is also great, do you think that it is the safest? Or Shinkansen is the fastest? Think again! Chinese high-speed rail \u00a8C or CRH \u00a8C stands out in front, commanding the top-6 places in world speed rankings and some 60% of global high-speed track mileage.  The Beijing-to-Shanghai high-speed train has even clocked in speeds up to 480 kilometers an hour. That's about 300 miles an hour! And with this high speed, the time to travel from New York to Washington could be shortened from the original 3h50min to 53.5min.  In 2017, the Renaissance EMU train achieved an average 350 km-per-hour journey between Beijing and Shanghai. That kind of speed would get you from London to Edinburgh in less than two hours. But the price is just a mere 20 pounds or so. In fact, China sells the cheapest high-speed train tickets in the world, which means if a Londoner gets on a Chinese high-speed train on Friday after work, it will be very easy to travel to Edinburgh and enjoy the most authentic Scotch whisky there.  \"High-speed rail changes life.\" That is why China keeps building it. Since high-speed rail debuted in China with the Beijing-to-Tianjin link in 2008, China has built four east-west high-speed lines across the country and four north-south routes. Along with its extensive high-speed rail networks, China has been transformed into a vast, economically-connected transportation network. Departing from Beijing in the morning, you can go to Shanghai to have a meeting and arrive in Hangzhou in the afternoon to enjoy beautiful scenery and eat local delicious sweet and sour fish near West Lake. At night, you can return to Beijing at 10pm, right on time. It is easy to shuttle between three cities in just one day. Nowadays, there are many young people choosing to live a twins life -- living in a quiet city while working in a bustling city. The transportation time is only an hour while the cost is as low as 16 US dollars. Different from other countries, high-speed rail construction in China receives government subsidies and support. It has also been constantly upgraded in the past five years. As high-speed rail increases the flow of economic and trade exchanges, it also facilitates the mobility of population and enterprises, allowing smaller cities to develop alongside major metropolises. As you know that in comparison to other forms of transportation, high-speed rail means reductions in noise, pollution, and energy consumption. Therefore, China can protect the environment with its best efforts, while still pursuing fast economic development. There are so many benefits about high-speed rail, no wonder that China has never stopped with its upgrades. In the past five years, under the leadership of Chinese President Xi Jinping, China is no longer satisfied with just having high-speed rail and its national system. The country continues to strive for a faster, safer and cheaper high-speed train.  On August 30, 2017, China announced the development of \"flying train\" capable of traveling at up to 4,000km/h, which will achieve \"low-altitude flight\" and float. If the train is launched, with its speed 5 times faster than an existing civilian aircraft, it could transform the world's travel mode.

{"content": "Primary and middle schools in Beijing should carry out thorough inspections of all apps, WeChat groups and QQ groups that students use, as well as the WeChat and Weibo public accounts they follow to ensure the mobile tools will not harm students' physical or psychological health. Education authorities in Beijing should submit a report on their progress to the Beijing Municipal Education Commission by March 1, the commission said on Tuesday in an online statement. Apps that contain pornography, violence, online games, commercial advertisements or that increase students' academic burdens are to be banned, it said. The content, links, functions and information security of apps should be strictly reviewed and sent for approval to higher education authorities, and unapproved apps are forbidden from use by schools. Homework and students' scores and rankings should not be shared in chat groups, and teachers should refrain from praising students or criticizing them in the groups, the statement said. Parents should not post sycophantic replies or advertisements or curry votes if their child is in the running for a prize or title, it said. Schools and education authorities should also strengthen their supervision of content and the comments on their own social media accounts. They should not post anything that is forbidden by laws or regulations, it said. On Jan 2, the Ministry of Education asked education authorities at all levels, along with middle and primary schools, to establish daily supervision to ensure that mobile apps used by the schools meet the standards set by the ministry. Schools should avoid using apps to increase the academic load for students, and educational apps used on campus are not allowed to charge money. Information should be protected and privacy leaks should be prevented, the ministry said. Xiong Bingqi, deputy head of the 21st Century Education Research Institute in Beijing, said the chat groups were originally designed as conduits of informative and harmonious dialogue between families and schools. Instead, the sheer convenience of the instant-messaging platform is becoming a cause of stress for teachers and parents alike. \"The chat groups no longer play their original role, but have instead devolved into a free-for-all in which parents argue, show off and bootlick to curry favor with teachers, while the teachers feel obliged to answer questions and requests from parents 24 hours a day, seven days a week,\" he said. Chu Zhaohui, a senior researcher at the National Institute of Education Sciences, said that although the Beijing regulation intends to protect students from harmful content, the education authorities should refrain from going to the extreme and regulating every aspect of students' lives. \"The part about teachers not recommending any social media account not managed by the school is a bit over the top, as students should have the freedom to follow any legal account they want,\" he said.", "overall-label": "education"}
{"content": "Nations improve multilateral exchanges and promote development of education  BRICS countries will continue taking measures to further strengthen multilateral exchanges and cooperation on education, according to a declaration signed in Beijing on Wednesday.  The five member nations - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - agreed to \"reiterate support for the BRICS Network University to collaborate in the fields of education, research and innovation, and encourage universities to participate in the BRICS University League\" in the Beijing Declaration on Education.  They also said they will encourage more teachers and educational administrators to learn from the experiences of other countries in improving teacher quality and performance, and promoting the development of education through international exchanges.  Senior education officials from member nations signed the declaration on Wednesday during the fifth meeting of BRICS education ministers.  They convened to summarize the achievements made in education cooperation among BRICS member nations during the past decade and to look into the future.  The previous four meetings were held in Paris, Brasilia, Moscow and New Delhi. The sixth will be held in South Africa.  Chen Baosheng, China's education minister, said in a speech at the meeting in Beijing that 10 years has passed since BRICS countries started cooperating with each other, and during the past decade BRICS has become a paradigm for cooperation among emerging or developing countries.  \"In particular, the countries have continuously deepened cooperation in education and achieved important progress,\" he said, citing that more than 40,000 students from BRICS countries were studying in China last year, accounting for almost 10 percent of all overseas students in the country.  Meanwhile, about 13,000 Chinese students were studying in BRICS member nations, Chen said. By the end of May, China had approved 152 education institutions or programs established with BRICS countries.  \"I hope that BRICS members will continue joining hands to boost people-to-people exchanges and enrich the form and content of cooperation on education, so that we can make educational cooperation a pillar and a highlight of people-to-people exchanges among the members and, moreover, contribute to the progress of education globally,\" he said.  As announced in the declaration, the members will encourage the expansion of scholarship opportunities to students from each other's country's and increase cultural cooperation through language education and multilingualism.  zhaoxinying@chinadaily.com.cn ", "overall-label": "education"}

{"content": "Northern pearl Dalian in Northeast China's Liaoning province is gearing up for the 2019 World Economic Forum's Annual Meeting of the New Champions, or Summer Davos Forum, from July 1 to 3, officials said in Beijing Tuesday. Dalian will hold a green, secure and innovative Annual Meeting of the New Champions, equipped with 5G technology, cloud computing, facial recognition and virtual reality, said Jin Guowei, vice-mayor of the Dalian municipal government, at a news conference. Themed as Leadership 4.0: Succeeding in a New Era of Globalization, this year's Summer Davos Forum will be more open and cooperative, attracting about 2,000 international participants from more than 100 countries and regions. The percentage of international participants will reach as high as 70 percent, a historical record compared to all past annual meetings, Jin said. Noticeably, the number of US representatives ranked second, following host country China, and about 300 representatives from the US will participate in the event amid China-US trade frictions, Jin added. Li Bin, counsel for the department of international cooperation at the National Development and Reform Commission, said economic globalization is an irreversible trend and China will continue to firmly support globalization and join hands with stakeholders to safeguard world economic openness and inclusion. China will also comprehensively strengthen its international cooperation in technological innovation and grasp new opportunities for a technological revolution to promote its quality economic growth, Li said. \"At this Annual Meeting of the New Champions, we hope that through the sharing and exchanging of views, participants from diverse communities will learn how to succeed in a new era of globalization, thus providing strong momentum for China's quality economic growth and global well-being,\" said Li. David Aikman, chief representative officer of the World Economic Forum Greater China, said people should look beyond the headlines and focus on cooperation and collaboration behind the scenes. There is tremendous cooperation taking place between China and the world, including the United States, and one of the examples is a series to bring the mayors of the world together to look at sustainable and smart cities, he noted. What can people learn from China's experience of pilot cities and smart cities? How do we leverage 5G in the internet of things to make our cities more sustainable and better for living? This is just one example of the ways in which behind the scenes people are collaborating and working together, Aikman added. As many international participants would like to open the channel for economic and trade cooperation with China at the annual meeting, the organizer has for the first time arranged a special department to provide long-term, professional and individual services to member enterprises of the forum, according to Jin. An enterprise exchange meeting will also be held in the evening of July 2 for business representatives from State-owned companies, foreign enterprises, local companies and private companies to communicate for business cooperation, Jin added. Dalian held the first Summer Davos Forum in September 2007 and this is the seventh time for Dalian to hold this forum, rotating with Tianjin.", "overall-label": "business"}
{"content": "XIAMEN - Hector Jesus Palacio from Colombia was never a singer until he thought of a song with Chinese lyrics in a dream. Titled Zhongguo Hao in Mandarin - China is Great in English - the song narrates Palacio's personal story in the country where he has lived for more than 20 years. He shot a music video and posted it on social media platforms such as WeChat and Facebook. The song, which has around 1.3 million views, made the 51-year-old Palacio famous overnight. In September 1994, Palacio came to Beijing to study. He didn't speak any Chinese, and the limited impression he had about China centered on Bruce Lee and kung fu. \"In the beginning, I couldn't get used to the food here. Chinese people like to use vinegar and soybean sauce in their food. It is quite different in Colombia,\" Palacio said. He overcame the initial hardships mainly using body language. To order food in Chinese restaurants, he pointed at dishes that other customers had ordered - a gamble that brought him both pleasant and distasteful surprises. He carried a map whenever he explored the city - with his campus circled in red - so he could ask people how to get back. Nevertheless, there were times he went the wrong way or took the wrong bus. The first Christmas he spent in Beijing was not a sweet memory. He hadn't adapted to the capital's cold winters and was still unable to speak Chinese. Loneliness was his closest friend in the silence of the night. These hardships were vividly depicted in the words of his recent song - \"Crying alone in my room. Every day I miss my home.\" The friends he made in China encouraged him to find a silver lining. They played soccer, hung out on weekends and talked with each other. \"There was a time I had dysentery and was in the hospital. My Chinese friends visited me with flowers and fruits, but none of my South American friends in Beijing showed up,\" he recalled, with tears in his eyes. Palacio used a verse to explain the support he received from his Chinese friends and express his gratitude. As a student, he spent two years learning Chinese, and the third year majoring in physical training. After graduation, he worked as an English and Spanish teacher for kindergarten students and adults in Beijing. To learn more about China, he moved to Shanghai, Hangzhou in Zhejiang province, and Taiwan, and worked as a language instructor and scuba diving instructor, before finally settling down in the coastal city of Xiamen, Fujian province, in 2005. In Xiamen, he met Wu Jingling, a local woman with long black hair, and the couple got married in 2012. \"Who would have thought that I'd stay in China? I planned to go back home after graduation,\" he said with a laugh. Palacio now works as a business consultant in a South American company, helping facilitate business with Chinese enterprises. His peaceful, stable life has seen unexpected changes after a dream he had in July 2017, like ripples in the water. \"I was singing a song with my friends at a summer party in my town in Colombia. They asked me, 'Why do you sing in Chinese? We can't understand what you sing,'\" he recalled. He suddenly woke up and realized it was just a dream. He then recorded the lingering melody on his cellphone. It was an incomplete piece of vallenato - a folk music style from Colombia's Caribbean region inscribed as an intangible cultural heritage. Vallenato is usually played with an accordion and a small drum, but he didn't know anyone who could play those in Xiamen. A miracle occurred the following winter when he met Angel Emir Soto in the city of Chongqing during a friendly soccer match between China and Colombia. Soto is a professional musician who plays the accordion. He came to China in 2015 and lives in Fuzhou, Fujian province, a two-hour trip on a bullet train to Xiamen. \"Palacio needed to finish writing the lyrics,\" Soto said. \"Then I spent two weeks producing the song in my studio.\" To come up with the lyrics, Palacio was also inspired and encouraged by his mother-in-law, who told him \"to sing about what you actually feel will touch people's hearts\". In addition to videos they posted online, they also performed live in bars in Xiamen at the invitation of friends, with both of them singing and Soto playing his orange accordion. \"The audience clapped their hands to the beat and gave us thumbs-up,\" Palacio said. Music knows no boundaries. The duo is working on their second project, translating a Chinese song into Spanish. \"We want to bring China and Southern American countries such as Colombia closer through music,\" Palacio said.

More than 20 intangible cultural heritage enthusiasts ranging from 12 years old to 60 took part in it. It was organized by Great Seed, a global community platform targeting all people interested in intangible cultural heritage to communicate, share, experience and inherit intangible cultural heritage worldwide. Zhang Fenglan, the fifth inheritor of Beijing-style   culture, introduced the exhibited  including blue and white series, ink series and bride gown series, designed and made by Zhang and her team. She said the Beijing-style   with less slit in the sides was more solemn and dignified than the Shanghai-style  . In the cultural creative products zone, Zhang shared some cultural exchange stories about the products. She said she designed a product with the colors of Chinese and Thai national flags for Thailand when she went there to hold an exhibition of Beijing-style   and related products. When asked about the difference between her and her masters, she said that she could innovate   style according to the aesthetic and demand of the masses. After the introduction, Zhang led the participants to the handwork area to experience the process of making a bud by using cloth and cotton. Many participants had handwork experience, some of them were even designers, and some of them had participated in similar activities several times. So the handcraft was relatively easy for them. A dress designer said the reason why she took part in the activity was that she wanted to know more about Chinese clothes, since she always made Western-style clothes. The 12-year-old girl said she was interested in Chinese culture, and wanted to participate more in future.", "overall-label": "life-style"}
{"content": "It'd been just over a week since my arrival in Chengdu. I had spent nearly three weeks in Beijing before coming to Chengdu and it was an absolute riot. I was part of a large group of teaching interns that were being trained and housed on the UIBE (University of International Business and Economics)campus in the first weeks of February. For all intents and purposes my time in Beijing was as Chinese as wal-mart or Macdonalds. The majority of our time was spent frollicking around in the blistering cold going to pubs and western cafes. One of the favorite spots being a little sports bar just down the street named Laker's where you could get a delicious burger and ten pints for around $10 dollars.   Even before getting on the plane things started to go wrong. Someone became too ill to board and had to be rushed to the hospital where they would be diagnosed with pneumonia. As a result of their premature evacuation the oragnizing member of staff that was supposed to accompany us on the trip became separated and upon arrival I along with 10 other interns were left hanging in the wind. We were however treated to a very sophistocated lunch at a european dining area before heading to the bureau of education. It was there that we met the leaders of our respective schools for the first time and set off rather anticlimactically to our new homes for the coming months.  Arriving on a Friday afternoon I was given the weekend to settle in to my new apartment which was admittedly very nice and contained far more than I had anticipated. So for the next two days I walked around my neighborhood taking in the sights and sounds, the smells and tastes of the streets next to mine. Those two days flew by however and come Monday morning I found myself standing before nigh 1,500 students giving my introductory speech. It didn't contain much and I was given a heads up so after some fervent practice it became a fairly managible task. Indeed it went off without a hitch and I was rewarded with the cheers and applause of all those young adults.  What I wasn't ready for was what happened next. After giving my speech I was told that I now had to teach two lessons back to back to the same class. This was a terrifying prospect. Not four days before then I was in Beijing standing in front of my peers giving my first lesson as part of a group of three. Upon being informed that I had two lessons to give without any preparation time I actually began laughing out loud at the notion. I walked into class and with all the clout of a scared little puppy I tried to get everyone to settle down and focus on me. I had no idea what I was doing. The two forty minute classes turned into a never ending Q&A about America and myself in regards to anything you would remotely consider personal. It got the job done I suppose but damn was it rough getting there. Thankfully those two classes were all I had for that day and in fact my first week I only taught a total of seven classes. Not a bad way to ease into a new job. It wasn't until the second week that things became far more interesting.  At the end of the first week I was given a schedule for the following week which contained over three times as many classes as the former. It was never once mentioned how many classes I would be teaching or what material to teach throughout that whole first week where I spent aproximately forty hours sitting at my desk doing nothing. This left me with the weekend to prepare for twenty-two classes. Like any prudent and thurough advocate of knowledge I waited 'til the very last possible moment to start my lesson planning, Sunday evening a few hours before I planned to be asleep.  Monday morning dragged itself to my front door and kicked it in with the force of a small army. It started miserably and without surprise continued to be miserable. I was still a little nervous about getting in front of all these groups of kids and my lack of preparation did nothing to promote a sense of confidence. I managed to get to wednesday before sucumbing to a rather nasty infection. My illness brought me to the apex from which I didn't think things could get any worse. I arose on Thursday morning and rushed to the bathroom spewing shit from both ends of my body. It was a nightmare. I phoned into work saying that I couldn't make it that day, that I was ill and needed to rest. Within a few hours four members of the school including the the head of the English department arrived at my abode to take me to the hospital. It was magnificent. They spoke to the doctors for me and paid for my medication, bought me a large box filled with cartons of milk and a bag of fresh fruit. I lay peacefully in utter awe of the level of care I had received. The following day I also stayed home and again two teachers showed up at lunch time and cooked me a homemade meal of dumplings and soup. I couldn't believe it, really. I'm almost positive that if the situation had been reversed and a chinese person had come to America under similar circumstances the only thing they'd get if they were sick is the middle finger. For me this marked a turning point that opened my eyes to the beauty that was all around me. Sure Chengdu isn't what I'm used to, the toilets are basically holes in the ground, the concept of a set schedule bears little meaning, and there's clouds in the sky literally all the time, but when you get a chance to see past the exterior what's underneathe satisfies the soul in a way the senses never could. I am truly grateful for all that my school and it's people have done to make me feel welcome in this new home of mine. In earnest, I wouldn't want to be anywhere else rather than here in Chengdu.

{"content": "A new transit card that works on public transport in 190 Chinese cities was issued on Monday in Shijiazhuang, capital of northern China's Hebei province. The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Interoperability Card is designed for use on all bus and subway systems in Beijing, Tianjin and all 11 cities in Hebei, aiming to provide convenience for passengers and better regional integration. Beijing and Tianjin have also issued such cards. They can also be used in cities that have joined a nationwide traffic pass union, which had 190 members in 2017 and will be expanded to more than 220 cities by the end of this year, said Li Yang, deputy manager of State-owned Shijiazhuang Smart Card Science and Technology Co, which issued the latest card. Passengers with the card can enjoy the same discount policies as local citizens when taking public transport in a certain city, Li said. \"The card can spare the trouble of buying new transit cards or tickets when a person goes to another city,\" Li said. Wang Yuling, an official from the Hebei Development and Reform Commission's Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei integrated development office, said coordination of regional development in recent years has driven a growing number of business people and workers to travel between Beijing, Tianjin and cities in Hebei. \"Easy payment methods for public transport can make business trips more convenient and save time, thus encouraging people to be more actively involved in and make contributions to the coordinated development of the region,\" Wang said. Xiao Ya, a regional manager at a recruitment company in Shijiazhuang, said she is always on business trips to different cities in China, especially to Beijing and Tianjin, and used to carry different cards in her purse for buses or subways. \"Each time, before I left for a business trip, I had to find and take the exact traffic card of my destination city,\" Xiao said. \"Now I just need one card no matter where I go.\" The card will be sold only in Shijiazhuang, but it can be recharged in other cities where it works and will be rechargeable online in the future. Many cities in the union have issued such cards. More than 13 million cards that can be used in different cities have been sold, a Ministry of Transport spokesman said in March. The ministry aims to expand the union to cover public transport in rural areas by 2020.", "overall-label": "politics"}
{"content": "Seeing the boom in the bike-sharing business, along with the resulting clutter created by randomly parked bikes, the Beijing municipal government has published a draft guideline for public comment, the top transport official said on Sunday. Zhou Zhengyu, director of the Beijing Municipal Commission of Transport, said that while the city will control the growing number of shared bikes from different companies, it will not impose a numerical cap. Instead, it will let each district government decide its own limit, taking public needs into consideration, as well as the development needs of the companies. \"People in Beijing have accepted the shared bikes well,\" he said. \"This green transportation method has motivated more people to start to ride.\" Having seen the popularity of the bikes, the authority decided to suspend the expansion of government-backed public rental bikes. \"The shared bikes from private companies clearly have advantages compared with the public bikes, even though the frequency of public bike use hasn't been affected much by the shared bikes,\" Zhou said. Beijing has 86,000 public rental bikes, stationed mainly near subway stations and residential communities, commission figures show. Because the public bikes have immovable racks on which bikes must be locked, many prefer the shared bikes, which can be picked up and parked at the rider's convenience. At present, Beijing has 700,000 shared bikes from companies including ofo, Mobike and Bluegogo. There are about 11 million registered users, equivalent to nearly half of Beijing's population, the commission said. The rapid growth started in August, and has created a few issues, like overcapacity and traffic disorder. Some users leave bikes randomly without obeying the regulations. And some companies put huge numbers of bikes on the street to protect their market share. The Beijing guideline asks each district government to set a maximum number of shared bikes, then provide that to departments responsible for regulating the companies. It also requires companies to use technology to strengthen the management of illegal parking, in addition to ensuring the mechanical safety of the bikes by conducting regular tests. Users who park illegally several times would be blacklisted, and companies would be barred from providing service to anyone on the list. Lin Lei, 30, a regular user of the shared bikes, said he believes a better-regulated industry will raise the satisfaction level of users. \"In some places, shared bikes create a mess\u00a3\u00adpiles of bikes\u00a3\u00adbecause people just throw them after use,\" he said. Yin Dafei, chief scientist in Mobike's big-data department, said the company has technology that can predict the parking patterns of shared bikes, which will help it to organize them and raise the company's operation efficiency.

{"content": "In badminton, you're supposed to keep an eye on the shuttlecock, but not too closely. You shouldn't let that speedy little devil pop you in the eye. It's a real danger, according to research published recently in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. Badminton is popular in China and Southeast Asia because of its accessibility and apparent low risk. But it may just be that you don't see the risks coming. A research team, led by Yu Jie and Liu Yi, both veteran doctor in Beijing Tongren Hospital's ophthalmology department, found that about 70 percent of eye trauma in badminton is caused by the high-speed shuttlecock, with 30 percent from being hit by a partner's racquet. A hard, direct strike can result in ocular injuries such as hyphaema, pupil dilation, traumatic cataract and lens dislocation. In rare cases, severe retinal detachment can occur, it said. The vast majority of eye injuries involve doubles players \u00a1\u00aa most frequently players turning around just in time to be hit by their partner. It's considered an improper move, but it's common among amateurs, according to Yu Jie, associate senior doctor in Department of Ophthalmology of Beijing Tongren Hospital. In addition, players in the forecourt risk being struck by their opponents. \"Many players don't know that playing badminton can hurt their eyes, therefore they have little awareness of self-protection. In fact, badminton has been classified as a high-risk sport for ocular injury due to the small, dense shuttlecock that can travel at the highest speed among all ball-related sport,\" she explained. A lack of professional guidance and failure to wear eye protective gear are the main factors leading to eye injuries, she recognized, citing research findings. The survey of 85 patients found that about 70 percent of the injured and 82 percent of the instigators had not received badminton lessons from a professional. Although 50 percent respondents said they knew of the high risk of an eye injury in badminton, none of them had taken any steps to protect themselves. Based on the research, Yu advised badminton players to wear special protective eyewear, especially forecourt players in doubles. Safety education and professional coaching are also necessary for beginners to prevent serious eye injuries, she said. Yu suggested extra precautions or avoiding badminton altogether for those with severely impaired vision or only one functioning eye. The research is regarded by experts as a meaningful step in China's initiative to integrate sports and medicine. The initiative aims to join domestic mainstream sports and medical resources to promote public health through cooperation in the healthcare and sports sectors.", "overall-label": "life-style"}
{"content": "BEIJING - President Xi Jinping on Sunday met with United Nations (UN) Secretary-General Antonio Guterres ahead of the 2018 Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), scheduled for Sept. 3 and 4. Calling the UN \"the flag of multilateralism,\" Xi said the world has been more in need than ever of multilateralism and a stronger UN as the rising unilateralism and protectionism is dealing a blow to the international order and the system of global governance. The most fundamental principle of multilateralism is to address international issues through consultation in accordance with the collectively agreed rules, with each country's interests and concerns taken into consideration, Xi said. Noting that China has always firmly supported multilateralism and safeguarded the UN's authority and function, Xi said China expects the UN to play its leading role in upholding fairness and justice, safeguarding world peace and promoting common development, especially in deepening global cooperation and in tackling challenges facing the world. China's resolve in comprehensively deepening reform is unchanged. The country is ready to take concrete actions to unite with all parties to uphold liberalization and facilitation of trade and build an open world economy, Xi said. Noting China's long-time friendship and shared destiny with Africa, Xi said China does not attach any political strings, nor does it seek any privilege or special interest in China-Africa cooperation. \"We will make unremitting efforts and do a good job as long as we believe it benefits African countries and people,\" Xi said. The FOCAC is a model of South-South cooperation and the Beijing summit will focus on unity, cooperation and common development, which are highly consistent with the UN's goals and purposes, he said. He called on the UN to take Africa as a priority in its work and support African countries in solving their problems in African ways so as to achieve long-term peace and stability on the continent. The UN should help African countries speed up development, support their unity, self-improvement and integration, and make their voice and influence greater in international affairs, Xi said. China is willing to strengthen communication and discussion with the UN on how to better support Africa, Xi said. Guterres said African affairs have always been a priority on the UN agenda and his attendance to the Beijing summit is evidence of the UN's support of Africa and China-Africa cooperation. As a model of South-South cooperation, the FOCAC will make important contributions to world peace and development with demonstrative significance, he said, wishing a complete success of the summit. He praised China for its commitment to supporting multilateralism, actively safeguarding the multilateral order and improving global governance when multilateralism is facing severe challenges. China's development, a trend that cannot be halted, is of great significance to the cause of world peace and development, he said. The UN is willing to strengthen dialogue and cooperation with China to build a rule-based multi-polar world and encourage other countries to participate in the Belt and Road construction, he said. Guterres also expressed his gratitude for China's great efforts in tackling global challenges including climate change despite difficulties. The UN expects more support from China on global governance and regional hotspot issues, he said.", "overall-label": "politics"}

{"content": "Police raided a suspected illegal dog meat distribution network in northern Beijing over the weekend. Thirty-four dogs of various breeds were confiscated, including one with an identification chip. Yangfang Township police worked with local animal welfare groups to rescue the animals and took them to a municipal animal shelter. According to surveys and media reports over the past two years, the dog and cat meat trade has developed into a well-segmented industry that involves stealing, collecting, shipping, slaughtering and selling of the final products such as meat and fur. As public concerns have grown over the unquarantined animal products and their potential threat to health, Chinese authorities have taken the battle nationwide. Earlier this month, police closed down a holding site for stolen dogs in Chengdu, Sichuan province. More than 30 dogs were handed over to the Qiming Animal Protection Center\u00a3\u00ada local charity\u00a3\u00adwhere they were reunited with their owners or adopted. The charity's executives said the site was well-known as a depository for stolen pets before operators killed the animals and sold the meat. In July, a truckload of 200 cats and more than 100 dogs was intercepted by the police in Zhuzhou, Hunan province. The driver was fined 2,000 yuan ($300). On Aug 7, 24 suspected dog thieves were prosecuted in Anhui province for theft, hiding or concealing proceeds and producing and selling toxic or hazardous food, the prosecutor's statement said. Under Chinese law, anyone who produces and sells toxic or hazardous food can face the death penalty. Stealing pets and working animals, as well as unlicensed keeping of dogs of unknown origins, are serious crimes. Unlawful practices involved in the meat trade, such as trading, transporting, butchering unquarantined animals and processing and selling the meat, are being tackled by various law enforcement departments. From food safety to social stability, every link in the illegal meat trade chain breaks the law, said An Xiang, co-founder of Beijing Dexiang Law Firm. In 2015, a new Food Safety Law came into effect, raising standards for ensuring public health and safety. Consuming illegal dog and cat meat could bring severe health problems, said Liu Lang of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Association of Veterinarians of China. In June, the Ministry of Agriculture tightened quarantine provisions regarding dogs and cats, as well as certifications, to combat the undocumented transportation of unquarantined animals. The ministry said it will improve quarantines in response to a national legislator's suggestion about bringing an end to this kind of meat trade. Xinhua", "overall-label": "politics"}

Fifteen international leading robot organizations are expected to attend the event on Aug 23-27, to share their cutting-edge theories and achievements in robotics and artificial intelligence (AI), as well as, discuss the industry's development, innovation trends and vision. The strategic distribution of AI on a global scale and policy direction are also going to be discussed.  The event, featuring a three-day forum, a robot exhibition and a set of robot contests, aims to build cooperation in technology, talent and development of the international robotics industry.  It has become the biggest and most international event in the industry since 2015, according to a report by Xinhua.  Let's take a look at the 15 international leading robot organizations showing support for the event.  The IEEE RAS is a professional society of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers that aims to foster the development and facilitate the exchange of scientific and technological knowledge in robotics and automation. The RSS, established in 2010, aims to nurture practice, education, training, innovation and techno-preneurship among individuals with passions for robotics science and robotics products in Singapore. The Italian Robotics and Automation Association, was founded in 1975 with the goal of serving people and organizations interested in robotics and its applications. The IFToMM, founded in 1969, supports international exchange of researchers and engineers from a wide range of disciplines related to mechanical engineering.  The IFRR, established in 1986, has the goal of establishing the theoretical foundations and technological basis of robotics.

{"content": "The nation will ramp up resources to strengthen international cooperation as it strives to build a globally competitive robotics industry and accelerate the use of smart machines in manufacturing, healthcare and other sectors. Miao Wei, minister of industry and information technology, the nation's industry regulator, said with robotics getting increasingly intertwined with artificial intelligence, big data and other technologies, the sector is playing an important role in driving economic growth. \"China, as the world's largest robot market, sincerely welcomes foreign companies to partake in the strategic opportunity to jointly build a global industrial ecosystem,\" Miao said at the opening ceremony of the 2018 World Robot Conference in Beijing on Wednesday. According to Miao, the ministry will roll out measures to encourage wider cooperation among Chinese companies, their international peers and foreign universities in technological research, product development and talent education.,China has been the world's largest market for robot applications since 2013. The trend has been further fueled by a corporate push to upgrade labor-intensive manufacturing plants. As the nation deals with an aging population, the demand for robots on assembly lines as well as hospitals is expected to jump significantly. Already, people aged 60 or older account for 17.3 percent of the total population in China, and the proportion is likely to reach 34.9 percent in 2050, official data show. Vice-Premier Liu He also attended the opening ceremony. He stressed that in the face of such demographic changes, China's robotics companies should move fast to adapt to the trend and get well-positioned to meet the potential huge demand. In the past five years, China's robotics industry has been growing at about 30 percent a year. In 2017, its industrial scale hit $7 billion, with the production volume of robots used in assembly lines exceeding 130,000 units, data from the National Bureau of Statistics show. Yu Zhenzhong, senior vice-president of HIT Robot Group, a major robot manufacturer in China, said the company is partnering with foreign robot heavyweights such as ABB Group of Switzerland as well as Israeli companies in product development.,\"International cooperation is of crucial importance to build a well-organized global industrial chain. We help foreign companies better tap into the Chinese market and frequent communication can generate new ideas for cutting-edge technologies,\" Yu said. HIT Robot Group was established in December 2014 with funding from the Heilongjiang provincial government and the Harbin Institute of Technology, an elite Chinese university that has conducted years of cutting-edge research on robotics. The university was the manufacturer of China's first space robot and lunar vehicle. Yu said the company has also established a venture capital fund to invest in promising artificial intelligence startups in the United States. Yang Jing, general manager of self-driving business division at JD, said the large scale commercialization of robots will come earlier than most people have expected. \"Systematic unmanned logistics solutions, for instance, will be far more efficient and cost-effective than human delivery services in future.

{"content": "LONDON - Over the week, international businesses, including British companies, have flocked to Shanghai for China International Import Expo (CIIE) to tap the huge market of the world's second-largest economy and seize possibly unmissable business opportunities. Drawn by the potential of the Chinese market, British International Trade Secretary Liam Fox led a delegation of 50 firms displaying British innovation to the first-ever event, which showcased opportunities for businesses to sell goods into China. Some British companies have secured lucrative deals with Chinese peers, including Rolls-Royce which signed an engine and maintenance agreement worth 10.13 billion yuan ($1.45 billion) with China's Eastern Airlines, one of the largest deals at the CIIE. \"Coming at this time, the CIIE has highlighted that China's economy will become more open, which is a positive message for businesses everywhere,\" said Stuart Tait, regional head of Commercial Banking at HSBC Asia-Pacific. HSBC released a special report at the CIIE to inspire international businesses to shift their strategies to do business in China, underlining the importance of understanding the Chinese consumers. \"To succeed in the future, international businesses must be 'Made for China.' China is no longer just the world's factory; its fast-growing consumer market is prompting international businesses to re-evaluate how and what they sell to China,\" Tait said. The report, entitled \"HSBC Navigator: Made for China\", surveyed 1,205 small and large companies across 11 key global economies that already export to China or are considering doing so. It found that businesses truly 'Made for China' are targeting those Chinese consumers born after 1980 to drive sales growth, and that technology services, consumer electronics and high-end intelligent equipment will be the fastest-growing sectors in the next three to five years. It also said the quality of their products will have to appeal to Chinese consumers, and distribution partners and e-commerce platforms are key to success in this market. David Roth, a senior executive of WPP, a world leader in communications services, said it's important for companies to understand Chinese consumers and to create products and innovation that are absolutely relevant to Chinese consumers. \"They shouldn't assume that products they currently make will necessarily be accepted by Chinese consumers,\" said Roth, CEO of The Store WPP in EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) and Asia. \"And that to create unique, different products or slightly change products to best meet the large Chinese market is going to be one of the reasons why some companies will succeed in China and some companies will fail,\" said Roth. The marketing expert advised international businesses to keep an eye on the second-tier and third-tier cities outside Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, which are growing at a very fast rate with consumers to have a higher disposable income than in the past. \"Those cities probably will represent massive opportunities,\" he said. As there are more opportunities now for foreign companies to try selling in China through e-commerce platforms like Taobao or JD.com, they do not necessarily need to start businesses with brick-and-mortar shops in China. \"Once they test their products and know what sells and what doesn't sell through their experiment with e-commerce platforms, it gives them more understanding and knowledge and certainty for a bigger expansion strategy within China,\" Roth added.", "overall-label": "business"}
{"content": "Just six days before more than 3,000 VIPs were due to land in the small Swiss ski resort of Davos for the annual World Economic Forum, its organizers issued a warning of grave global challenges. In its Global Risks Report 2019, the WEF highlighted several climate-related risks as well as those posed by a slowing world economy, geopolitical rivalry, weapons of mass destruction, cyberattacks, the spread of infectious diseases and large-scale migration. \"Global risks are intensifying, but the collective will to tackle them appears to be lacking. Instead, divisions are hardening,\" said the report. The report cautioned that the idea of \"taking back control\"-whether domestically from political rivals or externally from multilateral or supranational organizations-resonates across many countries and issues. This was probably a reference to United States President Donald Trump's America First policy, Brexit and growing populism in several industrialized nations, widely viewed as anti-globalization forces. Geopolitical tensions are rising among the world's major powers, and these tensions currently represent the most urgent global risks, the report said. \"We are moving from a unipolar to a multipolar world. We are also moving from a uni-conceptual to a multi-conceptual world,\" Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the WEF, said at a news conference in Geneva, on Tuesday. \"Dialogues in order to create mutual understanding are more necessary than ever before because we have to look at how in a world in which we do not necessarily share values, we share at least common interests,\" said Schwab, who founded the forum in 1971.,His comments came as several prominent world leaders canceled their trips to the annual gathering to cope with domestic issues. Trump announced on Jan 10 that he would not go to Davos due to a partial federal government shutdown and his fight with the Democrats over funding for a wall on the Mexican border. On Thursday, the White House confirmed that Trump had canceled his delegation's trip to Davos due to the government shutdown-the longest in US history. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had all been expected to attend and speak at a number of high-profile events to explain the often controversial policies of the Trump administration. French President Emmanuel Macron, haunted by 10 weeks of massive protests by the yellow vests movement, also canceled his trip to the WEF, which will be held from Tuesday to Friday. United Kingdom Prime Minister Theresa May, whose Brexit deal was defeated last week in Parliament but who narrowly survived a no-confidence vote, will also miss Davos to deal with the turmoil at home just 10 weeks before her country is due to leave the European Union. However, Schwab said he is proud of the unprecedented participation from emerging powers, such as the more than 140 Chinese participants-with 11 at ministerial level-and more than 100 attending from India. According to a study by multinational banking and financial services company Standard Chartered released early this month, China and India will be the world's top two economies by 2030 measured by nominal GDP using purchasing power parity exchange rates. By 2030, seven of the top 10 places will be dominated by emerging economies, which also comprise Indonesia, Turkey, Brazil, Egypt and Russia. Vice-President Wang Qishan will attend the WEF while also paying an official visit to Switzerland. He is scheduled to deliver a speech on Wednesday afternoon. Other prominent world leaders who will attend include Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, new Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. Some 65 heads of state and top international organizations are expected to be among about 3,000 government, business and civil society leaders from the more than 110 countries attending.,On Monday, just a day before the formal start of the WEF, Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, will present an update on the World Economic Outlook-a survey conducted and published by the Fund-in Davos. She is likely to renew the IMF's call on countries to foster cooperation to tackle challenges that extend beyond their borders, curb excess imbalances, strength-en inclusive growth, build resilience and improve convergence prospects for low-income developing countries. In its World Economic Outlook report in October, the IMF cut its global growth forecast for last year by 0.2 percentage points to 3.7 percent partly due to trade tensions between the US and its trading partners. The IMF warned that escalating trade tensions and the potential shift away from a multilateral, rules-based trading system are key threats to the global outlook. It said intensified trade tensions and rising policy uncertainty could dent business and financial market sentiment, trigger market volatility and slow investment and trade. The IMF has long warned that higher trade barriers would disrupt global supply chains and slow the spread of new technologies, ultimately lowering global productivity and prosperity. More restrictions on imports would also make tradable consumer goods less affordable, harming low-income households disproportionately. The comments have been widely interpreted as pointing to the Trump administration's unilateral and protectionist trade policies, which have inflicted costs on the US economy and others that are now deeply integrated in global supply chains. Theodore Pelagidis, a professor of economic analysis at the University of Piraeus in Greece, said, \"I expect that Davos 2019 will focus on the coming economic slowdown, indeed in an unstable political context of increased social polarization driven by nationalistic populism both in Europe and the US.\" He attributed the rise of populism to the breakup of the middle class in Western countries. \"As an economic slowdown is in front of us, political polarization is expected to become even more radical and aggressive,\" he said. Pelagidis, who is also a nonresident senior fellow of the Brookings Institution in Washington, believes the WEF may contribute to a better understanding of what lies ahead. \"And by trying to define uncharted waters, it could lead to the realization of the high political and economic risks that the global economy is going to face in the next couple of years,\" he said. Peter Bottelier, a visiting scholar at Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies in Washington, said the annual WEF meeting should definitely focus on the merits of multilateral approaches to solving and addressing global challenges. \"I hope that the meeting will openly and honestly discuss President Trump's ill-considered, mercantilistic, retrogressive, illegal and dangerous trade policies, especially vis-a-vis China,\" said Bottelier, a former World Bank official whose roles included being head of the bank's resident mission in China. China and the US have engaged in a tit-for-tat tariff war in recent months, since the Trump administration fired the first shots at China and other major trade partners last year. But many observers have seen signs for cautious optimism in recent weeks after renewed bilateral consultations between Beijing and Washington. Trump tweeted on Jan 8, \"Talks with China are going very well\". Vice-Premier Liu He will visit Washington on Jan 30 and 31 for further consultations on trade and economic issues, the Ministry of Commerce said on Thursday.,While the China-US spat is likely to draw much attention in Davos, the theme of this year's gathering-Globalization 4.0: Sharing a Global Architecture in the Age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution goes far beyond trade wars. Globalization 4.0 has been interpreted by some commentators as a bid to build a world order and international architecture under the new political realities of the 21st century, including taking into consideration factors such as inequality, the rise of populism, the invention and disruption caused by new technologies, and the outdated global governance system. Organizers said Globalization 4.0 is aimed at finding new models for peace, inclusiveness and sustainability. \"This fourth wave of globalization needs to be human-centered, inclusive and sustainable,\" said Schwab, of the WEF, who was among 10 foreigners to be granted the China Reform Friendship Award in December. Many experts have stressed that Globalization 4.0 must better address the problems faced by people who have been left behind both in the developed and developing worlds. Schwab said the world is entering a period of profound global instability brought on by the technological disruption of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and the realignment of geoeconomics and geopolitical forces. \"We need principals from all stakeholder groups in Davos to summon the imagination and commitment necessary to tackle it,\" he said. In a recent article titled Globalization 4.0: The Davos 2019 Manifesto, Schwab cited the fact that national leaders came together after World War II to design a new set of institutional structures to enable the post-war world to collaborate toward building a shared future. \"The world has changed, and as a matter of urgency, we must undertake this process again,\" he said. At the WEF, government, business and civil society leaders will offer their perspectives on what Globalization 4.0 should look like. Many experts believe that the world, including government and business leaders, is underprepared for the challenges and opportunities brought by the Fourth Industrial Revolution., New technologies, such as digital, will be a key topic in many discussions. While the technologies are likely to cause disruptions across industries and societies, Schwab believes they could also help underdeveloped regions, such as some in Africa, to catch up and narrow the gap with other areas. Chen Shengqiang, CEO of JD Digits, a leading Chinese digital technology company, will be among many tech chiefs from the country attending the WEF this year. He believes the data-driven economy continues to transform global value chains and to promote more economic players from different regions worldwide into the wave of globalization. \"Represented by digital technology, the Fourth Industrial Revolution changes a company's internal operating model, generates a data-driven global economy, helps to build a community with a shared future for mankind and to break 'self-centered consciousness' in the concept of value,\" he said on Saturday. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, an ardent advocate of multilateralism and action over climate change, will share his vision on Thursday in a conversation chaired by Borge Brende, president of the WEF. Guterres reiterated the importance of multilateralism in a speech at the UN headquarters in New York on Friday. \"As we look to the challenges we face-from climate change to migration to terrorism to the downsides of globalization-there is no doubt in my mind that global challenges require global solutions,\" he said. \"No country can do it alone.

{"content": "The premarital checkup rate in China increased to nearly 60 percent of all new couples in 2016, after a series of measures taken in recent years to encourage the exams as a way to help reduce birth defects, China's top health authority said. In 2016, 59.7 percent of all couples who married in China had a premarital checkup, with diseases spotted in more than 930,000 people that could affect birth, the National Health and Family Planning Commission wrote in response to written questions from China Daily. Premarital checkups, which target diseases that could affect the health of couples or their offspring, can help with early diagnosis and treatment and to promote reproductive health, reduce birth defects and improve the population's overall health, the commission said. Premarital checkup rates declined sharply in China once the exams became voluntary with the adoption of a new regulation in 2003. The rate declined to 2.9 percent in 2005 and rebounded to 41 percent in 2011 and to 48.4 percent in 2012, figures previously released by the commission showed. Birth defects had increased amid a declining rate of premarital checkups, records show. The incidence of congenital heart diseases in China in 2011 was 3.56 times that in 2000, according to a report released by the commission in 2012. Qin Geng, chief of maternal and child health at the commission, said the number of babies born with defects every year in China was estimated at 900,000. With the adoption of the universal second-child policy since the start of 2016, a rising number of couples are trying to have a child, including groups considered to have higher risks such as women older than 35. Some medical experts have called for more ways to encourage checkups to reduce health risks for both women and children. Of the 90 million women eligible to have a second baby, 60 percent are 35 or older, according to the national commission. Liu Wenxian, a cardiologist at Anzhen Hospital in Beijing, said that with the policy an increasing number of women with risky conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, are giving birth at hospitals. \"Some of them are in such serious condition that we advise them not to put their health at risk and have a baby likely to have birth defects,\" he said. \"We recommend all couples have a checkup before marriage and pregnancy, although it is no longer mandatory.\" In recent years, the commission has increased investment in promoting premarital checkups. It launched a pilot project in 2012 that includes free premarital checkups that initially covered the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region and Hainan and Yunnan provinces, it said. The project, aimed at reducing the incidence of Mediterranean anemia, an inherited blood disease that can be fatal for children, had covered 10 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions in southern China that are more severely hit by the disease, the commission said. With financial support from local governments, residents in 18 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions, including Beijing, Shanghai, Anhui and Hunan, can now undergo free premarital checkups, it said. Through promotional efforts in other areas, such as the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region and Fujian province, the premarital exam rate has risen to more than 90 percent, the commission said. In Beijing, the rate declined from 100 percent in 2003 to as low as 5 percent in subsequent years, and rebounded to about 10 percent in 2016 after various promotional efforts, according to the Beijing Commission of Health and Family Planning. Nationwide, major conditions covered by premarital checkups include inherited diseases, certain infectious diseases and mental diseases such as schizophrenia, according to a regulation released by the commission. HIV tests are not mandatory, but local governments can decide whether to include them in their checkup programs, the regulation said.", "overall-label": "politics"}

Consequently, a nubile friend of mine, who was a bit conservative and used to avoid online dating platforms as if they were plague, is now active on Yihao Chuanmei app. Yihao's USP is \"sharing\". Users can introduce their single friends to their \"circles\". Such singles are called \"love-hunters\", whom other love-hunters and users in the circle could contact, meet, date. Such services are legitimate business these days. Beijing-based consultancy Analysys reports that the Chinese online dating market pulled in more than 1.1 billion yuan ($150 million) in revenue in the first quarter of this year, up 9.3 percent year-on-year. My friend said Yihao is reliable as it targets \"high-end\" groups. Users and love-hunters are mostly top executives of well-known companies or startups. Their personal information is authentic, verified and strictly protected. \"When I see fellow love-hunters pair up, even I feel a sense of accomplishment,\" my friend said. As an icebreaker, a single can tip some money to a fellow love-hunter. The latter will get to know about the overtures in real time.

A special banner has been placed on the front page of the website of the National Forestry and Grassland Administration, displaying the slogan \"Where to go in spring? Plant trees and make China green.\" On Tuesday, China's 40th Arbor Day, the administration and the National Greening Commission also sent messages to mobile phone users, encouraging them to plant more trees. A day earlier, the first commemorative stamp in honor of Arbor Day was released in Beijing to mark the 40th Arbor Day. The stamp, with a face value of 1.2 yuan, bears the image of a pair of hands which resemble the branches of a tree. Above that tree, a beautiful scenery features green leaves, a stream of water, mountains, birds and houses. Liu Dongsheng, deputy director of the administration who attended the release ceremony, said Arbor Day had become an important occasion to arouse public awareness of green development. According to a statement issued by the administration, China plans to add 6.73 million hectares of afforested areas in 2019 to further expand forest coverage. The forest coverage rate of China has increased nearly 10 percentage points since the late 1970s, with the world's largest area of planted forests and an 80-percent expansion of forest areas, said Zhang Jianlong, director of the administration. In 2018 alone, China planted 7.07 million hectares of new forests and treated more than 6.66 million hectares of degraded grasslands, according to a communique on China's afforestation conditions released Tuesday. Participants from all walks of life took part in various voluntary tree planting activities last year, including ministers, generals, and leaders and cadres at all levels, the communique said.,Many government departments also took part in environmental efforts. In 2018, China's transport sector spent 8.79 billion yuan (about $1.3 billion) on highway greening, afforesting 79,000 km of highway, while housing and urban-rural development departments constructed green passages, with per capita urban green park areas reaching 14 square meters, it said. Chinese people have also been keen to participate in a virtual tree planting project in the mobile payment app Alipay. The project rewards low-carbon acts such as renting a bike or taking the bus with \"energy\" to \"water\" virtual trees, and the organizers will plant a real tree in deserts in China when a virtual tree grows up. A study using data from NASA satellites confirmed China's efforts on afforestation. Data shows that China and India are leading the increase in land greening and concludes that the \"effect comes mostly from ambitious tree-planting programs in China and intensive agriculture in both countries.\" In line with NASA's data, the greening rate of many Chinese cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Nanchang and Shenzhen saw an increase instead of a drop amid rapid urbanization, according to an ongoing study of the Chinese Academy of Forestry. Beijing has launched large-scale afforestation projects over the past few years, leading to an increase of 10 percentage points in forestry coverage in plains in just four years, the study showed. Besides land greening efforts, afforestation projects in Beijing also took into consideration forest quality and animals' needs by choosing plant and tree species with long life-spans or those that can provide food for wild animals. \"In the past, we only considered the needs of human beings. Now, we stress more on biodiversity,\" Deng Naiping, head of the Beijing Municipal Forestry and Parks Bureau, was quoted by Beijing Daily as saying. Deng said animals and human beings can share green space thanks to scientific tree species choices, which will contribute to harmonious coexistence between man and nature in the long term. Under a long-term afforestation plan, China expects to increase its forest coverage rate to 23.04 percent by 2020, and to 26 percent by 2035, as part of the plan to build a Beautiful China.", "overall-label": "politics"}

The country was just getting back on its feet,\" he recalls. Like most foreign guests who visited China in the early 1980s, he stayed at the Beijing Hotel, which faces south toward Chang'an Avenue. Every morning he would wake up to the ringing of bicycle bells and was astonished to look out of his window and see the street flooded with hundreds of locals biking their way to work. Over the following nine months, Clarke traveled deeper into the country, from far-flung mountain villages in Sichuan province, to regions alongside the Yangtze and Yellow rivers, and he talked to people from many different walks of life.,\"Once I got into the countryside, the locals were shocked and surprised at the unusual sight\u00a3\u00adin those days, my hair was still brown and I have blue eyes\u00a3\u00adyet, they were so incredibly kind and hospitable to me. \"I never saw anyone unemployed. Everyone seemed to be working really hard, and it was very clear to me that if somehow all this energy could be harnessed and driven in the right direction, China would become a country with colossal potential,\" he says. Clarke was disappointed when ABC aborted the production of the documentary due to changes in the relationship between China and the United States, but nearly 30 years after his first Chinese tour, Clarke returned to the country in 2013 to direct Better Angels, a documentary suggested by former US secretary of state, Henry Kissinger, and Nobel Prize-winning economist, Robert Mundell. Directed by Clarke and coproduced by American producer William Mundell and Chinese producer Han Yi, the documentary\u00a3\u00adwhich looks into the future of China and the US through the eyes of ordinary people in the two countries\u00a3\u00adtook nearly five years to complete. As well as Better Angels, which is scheduled for release in China and the US in November, Clarke has also recently produced another Chinese-themed documentary, In My Eyes. Directed by Han Yi, the feature film follows the journey of Cao Shengkang, China's first known blind global backpacker\u00a3\u00adwho has traveled alone to 34 countries on five continents. Speaking about modern China, Clarke acknowledges that the country has completely changed since his first visit three decades ago, and Beijing has become an impressive international metropolis full of hope and opportunity.,\"Some people call China's transformation the rise of China, but for me, it's actually the renaissance of China because, for many centuries, this country maintained the most sophisticated culture on the planet. \"It's really only in the last 200 years, under pressure from Western colonial powers that China's progress was thwarted. I think that now, however, China is rapidly re-establishing its rightful place as an innovative, exciting, technologically advanced country,\" says the filmmaker. \"One of the things I think China has yet to achieve, though, is a balance with the rest of the world, because the world still misunderstands China and, where misunderstandings exist, there is a place for fear to grow.\" As a veteran storyteller, Clarke believes that finding an emotionally engaging way of telling stories about the Chinese people can help the rest of the world better understand the country. \"What is interesting about the Chinese way of making documentary films is that filmmakers often start with the written word, a script. Only after the script is written do they venture out and shoot images that fit what has been written.\" Clarke believes this approach inevitably excludes what to him is the richest aspect of documentary filmmaking: the spontaneity of events that happen on location \"in the moment\".,The things that could never be anticipated can often become the most powerful scenes in the final version of a documentary, he adds. Clarke describes the country as \"a gold mine\" for documentary filmmakers and he says he plans to shoot two new features in the coming months. After helping Chinese director Lu Chunqiao with her directorial debut\u00a3\u00ada film on some teenage survivors of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, he has used the true stories of the survivors as the inspiration for a film, which will be set in Sichuan province, during the disaster. His second project will be a docudrama based upon the 2009 book, The Man Who Loved China, about British scientist Joseph Needham, who chronicled China's scientific achievements over the millennia in his masterpiece, Science and Civilisation in China", "overall-label": "life-style"}
{"content": "BEIJING - China will pay farmers to turn animal poo into fertiliser and power, the Ministry of Agriculture said on Wednesday, as Beijing cracks down on agricultural pollution that has for years leaked into rivers and lakes, angering Chinese residents.  China will give farmers subsidies to build animal waste processing facilities to make fertilisers or to treat manure so it's safe for disposal, and to install biogas plants that use methane to generate electricity, according a government plan announced on Aug 1.  The plan includes setting up recycling programmes by 2020 in 200 major counties that have livestock farms. That's less than half the 586 major counties the government says have hog and poultry farms.  The agriculture ministry gave no details about the size of the subsidies, but the move could be a big step towards curbing chemical fertiliser use and cutting water pollution.  \"We will help the farmers fully understand how organic fertiliser can improve energy efficiency and the environment,\" said Zhong Luqing, director of the fertiliser department at the ministry, at a briefing on Wednesday.  Biogas technology, which can help save on electrical costs, is too expensive for many farmers unless the government helps.  Those researching and using organic fertiliser will also get preferential treatment on loans, taxes, power use and land rent, Zhong said.  Getting rid of animal waste is a major headache for livestock producers worldwide, partly because of the strong odour and damage caused to the atmosphere by the release of harmful gases. Run-off containing animal wastes can also seep into the water table and contaminate rivers and lakes.  In China, how to better dispose of animal waste has become a particular problem due to the fast growth of poultry and hog farming over the past decade to meet demand for higher quality meat. Chinese livestock farms generate nearly 4 billion tonnes of waste annually, according to the agriculture ministry.  \"We will strengthen policy support and increase subsidies to support farmers to use organic fertiliser ... especially large-scale farmers, family farms and cooperatives,\" Zhong said.  The plan is part of Beijing's effort to limit chemical fertilisers and pesticides, which have contaminated soil and water. China uses about one-third of the world's fertilisers.  Beijing has said it was targeting zero growth of chemical fertiliser and pesticide by 2020. It has urged farmers to use less chemical fertiliser and turn to animal manure instead.

The district's human resources bureau said the plan is to train 100,000 people by 2022, at a rate of 20,000 a year. Two types of vocational training are offered: Western-style baking and pastry-making, and ski equipment cleaning and maintenance. The training is designed to help local farmers better serve the Games and improve their job prospects as ski tourism takes off in the area. Yanqing, 74 kilometers northwest of central Beijing, will host several events in 2022, including Alpine skiing, bobsled, skeleton and luge. \"The training is being provided on the basis of what farmers in Yanqing need. And there's an urgent need for local residents to have the skills training before the events approach,\" said Xu Xi, director of Beijing's Human Resources and Social Security Bureau, which is supervising the program. Xu said the training will be conducted by two vocational schools in Beijing, and that the farmers will also receive training in language and etiquette. Yanqing farmer Guo Junhua, 34, is an avid skier and a local ski coach. Because of a lack of access to professional training, she learned to ski on a mountain near her village. In September, friends who practiced on the same slopes introduced her to the Haituo \"farmer ski team\". She joined the 18-member team\u00a3\u00adwhose average age is 26\u00a3\u00adto get more professional training and help train others interested in skiing. In December, members of the team received some international-level training organized by the Swiss Ski Association. Guo said she is excited about the vocational training and wants to learn how to wax and store snowboards properly. \"I'm even more thrilled that I can use the opportunity to improve my English and enhance my chances of being a volunteer at the Winter Olympics,\" she said. Zhao Jinrong, 48, from Jingzhuang town in Yanqing, is receiving weekly training in Western-style baking and pastry-making from Beijing Industry and Technicians College. She has basic baking skills but never had the chance to learn professional techniques before. As the operator of a family farm restaurant, she said it is a precious opportunity to learn Western-style cooking skills and some basic English. \"Increasing numbers of foreigners are showing up in my restaurant,\" she said. \"To be able to say hello to them in English would really help me and my business.\" The college is providing the culinary and etiquette training for the farmers. Fang Weiguo, the college president, said it had invited a chef from a famous Western restaurant chain, Maxim's de Paris, to help provide professional training. \"It's also a way to make up for the lack of volunteer resources for the 2022 Winter Olympics,\" Fang said.", "overall-label": "life-style"}

{"content": "\"Every worker or dream chaser coming to Beijing has their own reasons. No one here lives blindly,\" said Chang Hailong, a 34-year-old food deliveryman from Songyuan, a city in the northeastern province of Jilin. Having only been in Beijing for a month, Chang is still curious about everything in the capital. \"I had the idea of starting a business in Beijing about 15 years ago, when I graduated from senior high school in my hometown,\" he said, with a wry smile. \"But I was held back by my father, who wanted me to take his position at the Daqing Oilfield because it was a job for life.\" When he was 19, Chang inherited his father's job, taking responsibility for mapping and measuring the oilfield. \"Actually, I didn't like the job, but I agreed to my father's request,\" he said. Two years later, he started work as a forklift truck driver at a chemical factory in Jilin. \"Life was boring in the factory. I worked from 9 am to 2 pm, but most of the time I had nothing to do because the forklift trucks were only occasionally used to carry products,\" he said. \"I got quite good pay there; enough to provide for my wife and 7-year-old son.\" Last month, Chang quit his comfortable life and traveled to Beijing to find a job. \"For me, it's a new start,\" he said. \"I was afraid before I came to Beijing, because I'm 34 years old this year and I could not have borne the blame from my family if I'd failed to find a job. However, it's my choice; Beijing has been my dream city since I was in senior high school.\" New to the food delivery market, Chang has performed poorly, compared with his peers. \"I was fined about 200 yuan ($30) because of late deliveries. I'm still not familiar with the community I'm responsible for, so I have to waste time asking for directions to restaurants and customers.\" Chang said he works from 7 am to 10 pm, and he dare not take a nap at noon in case an order arrives. Also, he skimps to keep his food expenditure below 20 yuan a day. Although he earned 7,000 yuan in his first month at work, he paid 1,500 yuan for rent. \"I'm okay with the life, but I want to give a better life to my wife and little son,\" he said. \"The financial pressure will spur me to work harder and become the delivery champion of my station.\" He said he has become more emotional since he started doing the job. \"Every 'thank you' from a customer is like applause for my work. It's different from my previous job as I get more human contact and meet different people every day.\" Though he is satisfied with his new life, he is still concerned about injury insurance and work safety. \"We have no official employment contracts. As for insurance, the company takes 100 yuan from me every month. They say it is for insurance, but I have no idea what insurance they are talking about. Also, it's unavoidable that I have to run red lights, as I have to rush to deliver food in just 38 minutes (the company's guaranteed maximum delivery time). I hope the time can be extended someday,\" he said. In the near future, Chang plans to open a restaurant in his hometown, and he hopes that his job as a food deliveryman will help him gain a better knowledge of people's favorite tastes.", "overall-label": "life-style"}

Han Yu, who heads the monastery's robot team, said, \"Actually, when the robot doesn't know how to reply, it will say so.\" A physical version of Xian'er, which is dressed in a yellow robe like a Buddhist monk, was unveiled in October 2015 and can sense its surroundings, answer questions and interact in simple conversations.

According to him, China's digital globalization is only just getting started but is gathering momentum, with local companies scrambling to venture out beyond their home-turf to search for opportunities.    One of such typical players is Didi. Sitting on an abundant cash reserve and powered by over 7,000 employees, the Beijing-based company is making stronger and faster moves on overseas expansion as well as business extension into next-generation technologies, including new energy vehicles and driverless cars.  When Didi acquired global ride-sharing giant Uber's China services a year ago, it secured absolute dominance in the Chinese market. As of now, more than 450 million users and 21 million drivers are using services from this on-demand mobility company.  And the fight is coming to the overseas markets where the company said it is confident of competing with Uber. It is stepping on the accelerator of global expansion, chiefly by partnering with a number of ride-hailing companies in foreign countries.  The company set up an international business department in February. Cheng Wei, founder and CEO of Didi, said: \"We are seeking to be the biggest operator of automobiles in the world.\"  In August, Didi announced it would invest in Dubai-based ride-hailing platform Careem, a week after it announced cooperation with Estonia-based Taxify, as the company steps up its push into markets such as the Middle East, Africa and Europe.  It also allied with Japan's Soft-Bank to inject around $2 billion into its existing partner Grab, and cooperated with Brazil-based taxi on-demand service 99, Uber's major US competitor Lyft, global car-rental firm Avis Budget Group, and India's ride-hailing company Ola.  Most of these platforms are fierce competitors of Uber in their respective regions. Building local partnerships with these influential local partners, which is a faster way than starting from scratch, has given a strong impetus to Didi's global presence.  Zhang Xu, an independent smart-transportation analyst, said whether Didi can take on Uber in overseas markets will depend on how quickly it can integrate its resources with its foreign partners.  \"So far, Didi's ties with them have been capital-oriented, but deeper collaboration can be expected on technologies, products and services,\" he added.  On top of tapping into international markets, Didi is also actively promoting the application of new-energy vehicles. It has formed a joint venture with the Global Energy Interconnection Development and Cooperation Organization earlier this year to roll out charging networks for electric vehicles, or EVs.  The move came after the Beijing-based startup signed up with National Electric Vehicle Sweden AB, which bought the assets of bankrupt Saab Automobile AB in 2012, to jointly develop EVs.  According to the International Energy Agency, also known as IEA, more than 750,000 EVs were sold worldwide last year, compared to 547,220 sold in 2015. China has surpassed the US to be the largest carrier of electric vehicles, accounting for 40 percent of the EVs sold in the world, twice as big as the US.  \"The future of transport is new energy vehicles, and ride-sharing will be a key link in promoting new energy on the road,\" said Cheng. \"With the advance of new energy and new transmission technology, we have the chance to build a global 'internet' of energy.\"  Apart from EVs, Didi is ratcheting up resources into artificial intelligence, as self-driving vehicles are widely seen as the next frontier of innovation.  In November, the company announced the opening of its main US research facility in Mountain View, California, to facilitate the growth and expansion of its Bay Area-based team. The new campus is located in the heart of Mountain View on National Avenue, with offices covering 36,000 square feet and capacity for more than 200 employees.  This is part of the Didi Labs, a laboratory unveiled in March this year. Bob Zhang, CTO of Didi Chuxing, said at the campus opening: \"It's been an exciting year for Didi Labs. Our talented team is growing fast and making important contributions across our key tech areas, from smart-city transportation management, AI ride-matching, to security and new product innovation.\"  Having hands in an array of transportation services, including taxi, premier cars, mini bus, car rental, hitch and investments in bike-sharing, Didi's latest push in self-driving cars highlights once again its ambitions of building a one-stop platform to meet people's various demands.  \"We are seeing a great revolution which integrates the internet of information, the internet of energy, and the internet of transportation. Didi hopes to play an important part in promoting such integration so as to make cities better,\" Cheng added. ", "overall-label": "business"}

{"content": "Okay, 10.5 million yuan ($1.45 million)\u00a3\u00adthat's the price of a 91-square-meter basement flat in western Xicheng district, the Beijing News reported earlier this year. If you find the price tag shocking, you need a reality check. As a mother of a would-be elementary school student, I'd say 115,006 yuan per sq m might be a good bargain\u00a3\u00adthat is, if the basement flat, like the one in Xicheng, is in the neighborhood of a prestigious school, such as the Huang Cheng Gen Primary School and Beijing No 4 High School. The flat in question was built around 1990. The average sale price of new apartments in Beijing was 45,347 yuan per sq m in March, when the basement flat was sold at a huge premium. Premiums are paid because there is a strong correlation between perception and property prices. Chinese parents think education from reputable institutions, starting from kindergarten to university through primary, middle and high schools, is essential for success in an increasingly competitive society. So, a head start, in the form of education at a much-sought-after school, would help. Now, we know that when demand outstrips supply, then prices, including those of perception-propelled properties, rise\u00a3\u00adnever mind their age or quality. And they rise everywhere. A 29.58-sq-m flat in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, was sold for 3 million yuan last November. That's 100,000 yuan per sq m, Zhejiang Online reported. This, at a time when Hangzhou's new homes were selling at an average 27,659 yuan per sq m. A similar flat in the same community was sold at 83,123 yuan per sq m a year ago. It's not much different outside China. For example, in the US, homes in a district with good schools command premium prices, although the price differential may not be as high as in China, said Hao Yue, a realty agent with Douglas Element Property in New York. Similarly, in England, homes near a good primary school add 18,600 pounds ($23,697) to the average price, the BBC reported recently, citing a study by the UK education department. Prices of homes near the best-performing primary schools are 8 percent higher and homes near the best secondary schools are 6.8 percent costlier. The UK education department said any of the top 10 percent of primary schools in London would add \u00a1\u00ea38,800 to the value of a home nearby. The average home price in the UK's capital was \u00a1\u00ea484,700 in July 2016. Analysts said amendments to current policies may help ease the pressure on Chinese parents to buy strategically located but ordinary properties at premium prices. If children are allowed to receive education from schools irrespective of whether their parents own or lease homes in the same locality, the property industry dynamic might change, they said. To ensure access to education is evenly balanced between children of parents owning homes in the neighborhood and children of parents leasing homes, the central government picked 12 cities for a trial of a new policy. Schools in many cities like Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Nanjing, Hangzhou and Xiamen now admit children of parents who rent homes in the neighborhood. In these cities, it is not necessary for parents to own homes in the school localities. Although Beijing and Shanghai don't figure in the list, Beijing has published regulations to guarantee children of parents living in rented homes receive proper education. For its part, Shanghai has set aside several land parcels for rental housing projects. \"For parents owning or leasing homes, equal rights to proper children's education are just the beginning of change. People will gradually realize that buying premium-priced property is not the only way to high-quality education,\" said Yan Yuejin, director of the E-house China Research and Development Institute, a Shanghai-based real estate information and research services provider. In the US, higher home prices in districts with good schools lead to higher property tax. That helps fund schools' infrastructure development and wages for top-quality teachers. Such an ecosystem ensures top quality of education. The flip side of market forces is that a good school will attract well-off families that are willing to pay a premium for residential properties in the neighborhood, thereby driving prices up.", "overall-label": "education"}
{"content": "BEIJING - Beijing's GDP was estimated at more than 3 trillion yuan ($444 billion) last year, making it the second Chinese city crossing this threshold following Shanghai. Beijing mayor Chen Jining said Monday the city set its economic growth target at 6-6.5 percent for 2019, compared with last year's target of about 6.5 percent. \"Beijing is in a critical period of urban renewal and high-quality development,\" Chen said while delivering the annual government work report at the meeting of the annual session of the Beijing Municipal People's Congress. The Chinese capital is fostering new momentums for high-quality growth powered by non-capital functions removal, innovation, and further opening-up. The work of relieving Beijing of functions nonessential to its role as the capital has progressed remarkably in 2018, Chen said. A total of 656 manufacturing companies in the city were shut down, and more than 200 markets and logistics centers were relocated last year. In 2019, more than 300 manufacturing firms and 66 markets and logistics centers, usually high-polluting or low-end industries, will be phased out or moved to nearby regions. The removal of non-capital functions from Beijing is part of a greater strategy to integrate the development of Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei for a better economic structure, cleaner environment, and improved public services. Zhao Hong, deputy head of the Beijing Academy of Social Sciences, pointed out that innovation and high-tech sectors could power the high-quality growth. The number of national high-tech enterprises in Beijing reached 25,000 in 2018, up 25 percent year-on-year. On average, 199 innovative startups opened in the city every day, according to the government work report. In 2019, the city government will continue to expand global channels for attracting science and technology talent, encourage universities to beef up the building of innovation centers, and give support to young and innovative entrepreneurs. \"In addition, Beijing can create a more friendly-business environment to tap into the market potential and stimulate high-quality growth,\" Zhao said. Beijing will release new measures involving foreign exchange management reform, cross-border use of the yuan, and investment and financing facilitation in 2019. International financial institutions such as banks, insurers, securities, and fund firms, as well as professional service organizations covering the fields of accountancy, audits, assessments, and credit are welcome to set up regional headquarters or affiliated agencies in Beijing. Last year, Beijing's actual use of foreign capital surpassed $16 billion. Meanwhile, a total of 618 foreign talent have obtained permanent residency. To boost consumption in the night-time economy, Beijing will encourage malls, supermarkets, and convenient stores to extend their opening hours this year, the work report said. Beijing plans to slash its prospect for public budget revenue growth to 4 percent in 2019, down from about 6.5 percent last year. Chen said the capital will continue to cut taxes for small- and micro-enterprises as well as start-ups, in addition to about 18.8 billion yuan of tax cuts in 2018. Xu Zewei, chairman of 91 Technology Group and a deputy to the Beijing Municipal People's Congress, said compared with government subsidies, tax cuts can benefit more companies and save their operating costs. \"Companies can put the money saved into research and development or use it to tap into new markets,\" Xu said.", "overall-label": "business"}
{"content": "A new remake of Peking Opera classic   is expected to premiere for opera lovers in Beijing in late May. A representative opera piece of the late Chinese theater mogul Mei Lanfang,   tells a love story based on the legend of Xiang Yu - the warlord of the ancient Chu Kingdom - and his beloved consort Yu. Xiang lost a battle for the throne, and Yu committed suicide with his sword. Zhang Huoding, one of the most popular Peking Opera stars in today's China, will take the opera makeover to the stage of the Chang'an Grand Theater on May 25, as the closing show of this year's Meet in Beijing international arts festival. Celebrated Peking Opera artist Gao Mukun will star as Xiang Yu. For 48-year-old Zhang, it's a dream come true. \"It's always been my dream to play concubine Yu since I was learning Peking Opera in Tianjin in the 1980s, but I didn't get the chance,\" Zhang said at a news conference in Beijing on Tuesday. \"I look forward to it very much and I hope the audience will like it.\",Zhang is an inheritor of the \"Cheng School\" of Peking Opera, a performing style founded by Cheng Yanqiu (1904-58), one of the great Peking Opera masters of the 20th century. While Mei Lanfang's \"Mei School\" is famous for his smooth, moderate and poised style in playing elegant female roles, Cheng style is known for interpreting tragic women with frequent changes in sounds and rhythm. Though   has long been a masterpiece of the Mei School, Wan Ruixing, renowned Peking Opera composer and player of the   (a high-pitched two-stringed fiddle used in Peking Opera), said the Cheng School's sorrowful tunes and slow rhythm also could be a decent interpretation of concubine Yu's tragic fate. \"There are more tragedies in the Cheng School's plays and the character of Yu and her deep sorrow in the legendary story meet very well with the features of the Cheng School,\" said Wan, who is also responsible for the new play's method of singing tunes.,A former actress from the China National Peking Opera Company, Zhang has performed in sellout shows across China, including a solo show at the Great Hall of the People in 2007. In 2015, Zhang made her US debut at Lincoln Center in New York by performing two famous Peking Opera pieces,  and  . She now spends much of her time teaching Peking Opera at the National Academy of Chinese Theater Arts, one of the top academies of traditional Chinese operas, to pass on the ancient art to younger generations. Peking Opera is a 200-year-old Chinese theater art dating back to the 18th century, which combines speech, song, dance and martial arts.

{"content": "In one week, Shanghai will start enforcing its first regulation on domestic waste management, joining other large Chinese cities piloting a shift to make garbage classification compulsory, instead of voluntary. Since the beginning of this century, China has encouraged people to sort household garbage voluntarily. While more people have realized the importance of garbage classification, the effect was not so great in terms of collection. Shanghai's regulation requires people to sort trash into four categories - dry garbage, wet garbage (kitchen waste), recyclables and hazardous waste. Individuals who fail to do so may be fined up to 200 yuan ($29.11), while companies and institutions face fines of up to 50,000 yuan. Liu Xinyu, a researcher with the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, said that the significance of this legislation is to transform the past voluntary action into the compulsory action of every citizen. Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Hangzhou have enacted or revised regulations on garbage classification to enhance the guidance of people's actions, strengthen classification in the whole process and supervise law enforcement. At a meeting of the Beijing Municipal People's Congress at the end of May, representatives have proposed revisions to the city's regulation on domestic waste, adding more punishments for offenses. Wu Xiangyang, a researcher with the Beijing Academy of Social Sciences, said that garbage classification work was not so ideal in the past because of the lack of forceful measures, and the revision will place restrictions on people's behavior. Guangzhou put into practice its regulation on garbage classification starting July 1 last year. In August, one resident became the first to be fined 200 yuan for violating the regulation. While large cities piloted the forceful measures, the central authority has recently issued a notice to ask all cities at the prefecture level and above to start work on the promotion of household garbage classification this year. The 46 cities currently involved in a household garbage classification pilot program should set up a system to classify and dispose of their household garbage by 2020, the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development said.

About 200 supervision teams have been sent to the region, with the focus on steel, coal-fired power plants and construction industries, according to Li Ganjie, the minister of ecology and environment. \"The campaign is a long-term mechanism rather than a short-term movement, which aims at helping local governments solve their pollution problems and improve the environment,\" he said on Sunday. The ministry said on Sunday that teams had checked 1,254 companies in Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei province, as well as surrounding areas, and discovered three companies that failed to meet air pollution standards. In Hebei, North China's Shanxi province and Central China's Henan province and Tianjin, a total of 13 companies failed to meet the anti-air pollution installation standards, and 11 industrial companies' anti-air pollution facilities were not in working condition. The ministry also announced one excessive pollutants discharge case in Shijiazhuang, Hebei province, and 35 construction fugitive dust emissions in Hebei and Shanxi. The ministry has handed over all the cases to local governments, which will deal with the involved companies and individuals according to laws and regulations. The ministry started the environmental protection campaign to strengthen the supervision against illegal pollution on June 11. It focuses on areas that include the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, the Fenhe-Weihe plain in North China and the Yangtze River Delta region.

Hu Dong, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television, says that nearly 100 scholars, industry veterans and movie critics shortlisted the nominees after five rounds of selection.  He says the 15 nominated movies were selected from 424 films-all released after Jan 1, 2016 - from 59 countries and regions.  For local movie buffs, the two nominated Chinese-language movies are  inspired by China's hunt for a Myanmar drug ring that killed 13 Chinese sailors in 2011, and Mr No Problem, a satire based on Chinese literary giant Lao She's 1943 namesake novel.   has received high scores on major review sites and tasted commercial success, too, topping last year's National Day holiday box-office charts.  however, has not been released for general viewing, but it has already impressed Chinese filmmakers after it took home two awards at Taiwan's 53rd Golden Horse Film Festival.

{"content": "Peng Lei bursts into laughter when he is asked about the birth of his band, New Pants. \"I really didn't expect that we would go this far,\" says Peng down the phone from his home in Beijing. As the frontman of New Pants, Peng founded the Beijing-based band in 1996 along with his schoolmate, Pang Kuang. They were both students at an art college in Beijing majoring in animation back then. \"I thought the band would break up or soon be forgotten,\" adds Peng, the self-taught guitarist, who had previously formed his own band in high school. Decades later, New Pants has grown into one of the most-watched bands in the country and has released eight full-length albums, including their 2007 hit opus, Dragon Tiger Panacea, which mixes vintage 1980s' new wave with disco. They play a retro blend of synthpop, punk and rock, drawing influence from a diverse spectrum of bands from the 1970s, 80s and the early 90s. On March 23, New Pants will be performing in the capital for the first time in eight years with a concert at Beijing Workers' Gymnasium. It is a testament to the ensemble's enduring popularity that when tickets for the concert went on sale on Feb 15, they sold out within 10 minutes. The show will be the finale of the band's nationwide tour, entitled New Wave, which kicked off in April last year and has encompassed more than 10 cities, including Changsha, Hunan province, Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, Chongqing and Tianjin. \"We are not productive as a band. For each show, we want to have fun and be different,\" says Peng.,This ethos is demonstrated perfectly by the poster for the upcoming Beijing concert. It pays homage to the cover of the band's self-titled debut album, and has the four members: guitarist-vocalist Peng, key-board player-vocalist Pang, bassist Zhao Meng and drummer Hayato, lying on their sides, facing the camera in mock-seduction, set against bold, primary colors. While the poster features current photos of the bandmates, on the original album cover, they were replaced by crudely drawn cartoon figures. That first album, released in 1998, was heavily influenced by American punk rock band, the Ramones, and soon won the band a loyal fanbase thanks to their raw punk vibe. As Peng recalls, the indie music scene in the capital back then was dominated by heavy metal music. \"It was a totally different way of looking at the world then,\" Peng says. \"The indie music scene was not appealing to the mainstream audience, but it was vibrant.\" After graduating from university, Peng worked for a Beijing-based advertising company, making about 1,500 yuan ($224) a month. A year later, he spent his first year's income on a guitar, which he bought in Hong Kong. In 1997, the band signed to Beijing-based indie record label, Modern Sky, and Peng became a full-time singer-songwriter. The band developed with the label, which was founded by former rocker, Shen Lihui, in that same year. In the beginning, the label only signed three indie bands: New Pants, Supermarket, and Sober, for which Shen was the leading vocalist. \"No one was interested in indie music then. The scene was dominated by mainstream record companies. We just made music for fun. It was purely idealism,\" says Shen.,Decades later, things have changed. Indie music has become incredibly popular among young Chinese music lovers and Modern Sky has grown into the largest indie record label in the country, which is home to over a hundred bands and artists. It's brainchild, Strawberry Music Festival, has become a popular outdoor music event, attracting a young Chinese audience from across the country. The label has also expanded its reach by establishing satellite offices, signing local bands and artists and hosting outdoor music festivals in the United Kingdom and the United States. With fans opening up to a greater diversity of music, New Pants has been experimenting various different styles, such as old school punk, disco, and electronic music. The music, however, is not all that keeps New Pants going. In his early 40s, Peng, who is now a father, says that the key to the bands longevity is the constant energy and drive to be creative. Besides music, Peng, who was born into an intellectual family, has embarked on various career opportunities. He published a book of illustrations, directed movies and has held art exhibitions. One of his books, Beihai Monster, released in 2009, was inspired by his own life and named after Beihai Park, which was one of his favorite places as a child. Like Peng, keyboard player Pang has also developed his career in other fields besides music, launching his own fashion brand and working as a designer.", "overall-label": "life-style"}

Pompeo canceled his trip to Davos due to the current US government shutdown. Commenting on the next round of US-China trade talks, Pompeo said he was optimistic that the Chinese delegation would be well received and both sides would \"have a good outcome from those conversations.\" The Chinese Commerce Ministry said last week that Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will visit the United States on Jan 30-31 for trade negotiations. When asked whether effort to resolve the US-China trade friction could achieve any breakthrough, Pompeo said that he was hopeful that each of those issues could be dealt with constructively. \"I don't want to get ahead of the conversations and negotiations that are taking place. There is lots of hard work to do,\" he said. \"I am very confident that there will be a bright future for the United States and its people, but for the Chinese people as well,\" he added. Washington imposed steep tariffs on Chinese imports worth billions of dollars last year,prompting retaliatory tariffs by Beijing.

Watching sunset and full moon, tasting Chinese foods and mooncake, enjoying songs and dances, guessing riddles, drawing raffles, all these reminded them of the families far away on the other side of the globe. Falling on the 15th day of the 8th month according to the Chinese lunar calendar, the Mid-Autumn Festival is the second grandest festival in China after the Chinese New Year.

{"content": "As a child, jazz pianist Luo Ning enjoyed lying under a big tree and seeing the rays of sunlight shine through the canopy of leaves after he was done with hours of piano practice. Little did he know that this scene would become his inspiration for his original piece When Light & Shadow Meet, which is also the name of his latest album. \"When I learned classical music, I liked poetic pieces by Debussy and Maurice Ravel. Their pieces are full of colors, just like Impressionist paintings,\" says the Urumqi-born pianist. The album, which was released on July 6, features nine pieces that combines Luo's original materials with classic jazz songs. This is his first album after signing with jazz record label GRP Records, a company under Universal Music Group. Recorded in Los Angeles, the new album features a collaboration with US jazz fusion drummer Dave Weckl, bassist Tom Kennedy and trumpeter Wallace Roney, as well as Chinese jazz musicians, including drummer Lu Xun and saxophonist Wu Letian. \"We had quite a tight schedule, recording five songs in a day, because all the musicians are busy and they had to fly from different parts of the world to Los Angeles,\" says Luo. \"The music we performed in the studio is just like the sunshine of Los Angeles, clear, warm and colorful.\" Weckl has been to China a few times but this was his first collaboration with a Chinese musician. \"I am really glad to see how Chinese music and Chinese drummers are improving so quickly,\" says Weckl, who introduced his long-time friend bass player Kennedy and saxophonist Brandon Fields to Luo.,\"We had a splendid time working together. Luo played all the piano and electric piano tracks. He's been to Cuba to learn music before so he knows how to perform in the language of Latin music.\" Luo, who started learning classical piano at 4, studied at Xinjiang Arts University before arriving in Beijing in 1996 to pursue his jazz dreams. In 2010, he furthered his musical education at the University of Arts of Cuba where he studied with Cuban pianist Chucho Valdes. The eight-time Grammy Award winner, now 75, immediately opened Luo's eyes to the jazz genre, Afro-Cuban music and Latin American rhythms. Luo and Weckl worked together to compose a song titled Life Philosophies for this latest album. The song was based on an earlier piece that Luo wrote. \"Many of my compositions come from my intuition. During my childhood, I liked improvising while playing classical piano pieces. It's about capturing feelings at a particular moment,\" says Luo, who wrote For Us and Everyday Is A New Day for the album. He also performed Stella By Starlight, arguably one of the most popular jazz standards of all time, You're My Everything, a 1931 song composed by Harry Warren, and Blue in Green, composed by trumpeter Miles Davis and pianist Bill Evans. \"When I first heard his music, I thought these works were so special. The musicality was so subtle, and it had different cultures clashing into each other,\" says bass player Kennedy of Luo's album. Luo says that his music is influenced by his hometown of Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region - many of his works feature ethnic music elements. He also likes to fuse jazz with music from Xinjiang, including the pieces The Beautiful Kashgar, Xinjiang Xinjiang and The Heart of Sayram Lake. He has also experimented combining jazz with other types of Chinese music. One of his earlier works is Farewell My Concubine, which was inspired by the famous Peking Opera piece of the same name performed by late master Mei Lanfang (1894-1961). Luo wrote his rendition in 2011 after visiting Mei Baojiu, son of Mei Lanfang, who is also a Peking Opera master. When Luo first came to Beijing in the 1990s, he met renowned jazz musician Liu Yuan, who is considered one of the pioneers of jazz music in the country. Liu, a Beijing native who started out as a folk musician in his early 20s, first learned saxophone in the 1980s when there were only five or six professional jazz musicians in Beijing. Liu often jammed with other musicians at East Shore Live Jazz Cafe, a famous jazz bar located nearby Beijing's Houhai Lake. On July 22, Luo will perform at a jazz festival in Marseille, France, at the invitation of Huang Yong, the president of the China Jazz Association. ", "overall-label": "life-style"}
{"content": "China's new bullet train models with the name Fuxing - meaning rejuvenation - emblazoned on the outside of the cars were officially launched on the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway line on Monday.  A CR400AF model departed from Beijing South Railway Station at 11:05 am and headed to Shanghai, as a CR400BF model left Shanghai Hongqiao Railway Station for Beijing.  The new models typically travel at speeds of around 350 kilometers per hour but are capable of reaching 400 km/h.  It took the first train from Beijing about 5 hours and 45 minutes to reach Shanghai. On the way, it stopped 10 times, including at stations in Jinan, Shandong province, and Tianjin.  The line was chosen for the new bullet train models because it has been one of China's busiest railways, averaging about 505,000 passenger trips daily, according to China Railway Corp, the State-owned rail operator that led the design of the new models.  Liang Zhaoyu, spokesman for the company, said all the tickets for the first run using the new equipment from Beijing were sold out on Monday. The price was the same as for the existing high-speed routes between the two cities.  He said there would be two pairs of high-speed trains running between Beijing and Shanghai using the new Chinese-standard bullet train through the end of this month. Starting July 1, four pairs of high-speed trains operated between the two stations will include the new standard equipment.  The height of the new models was raised to 4.05 meters from 3.70 m - the same height as the existing bullet trains - while power consumption was reduced by 17 percent, said Lu Yang, chief researcher at the China Academy of Railway Sciences.  He said the new models have a powerful safety monitoring system with more than 2,500 sensors - 500 more than on existing high-speed trains.  \"The sensors are like eyes, monitoring the state of the train - whether it's the operational situation, the temperature of the bearings, the brake system or the compartment environment - at all times to ensure safety,\" he said.  If something goes wrong, the monitoring system will sound an alarm automatically and could take automatic measures, such as reducing the speed or even stopping the train, Lu said.  Apart from larger, more comfortable spaces for passengers, the new models have some other passenger-friendly features, such as better-placed chargers.  Richard Herzfelder, an agriculture specialist from the United States who has worked in China for more than 10 years and often travels on high-speed trains, said he found it more convenient to use chargers.  Previously, charging stations for phones or computers were often found below the seats. On the new bullet trains, they are located near the armrests. Herzfelder said he appreciated the change, as he no longer needs to stoop to charge his electronic devices. ", "overall-label": "tech"}

The duopoly of State-owned giants China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp and China Aerospace Science and Industry Corp remains unchallenged because they are in control of the most essential part of the space business\u00a3\u00adthe carrier rockets. However, private players appear to be very close to breaking the duopoly. In the latest attempt from the private sector, OneSpace Technology, a space startup based in Beijing, announced on Tuesday that it has finished the construction and testing of its first carrier rocket, the OS-M, and is ready to transport it to the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwestern China for the model's debut mission in late March. If the mission is successful, OS-M will become the first carrier rocket designed and built by a private Chinese company to fulfill an orbital launch. In October, LandSpace, another private space company based in Beijing, launched a carrier rocket, the first of its ZQ 1 series, at the Jiuquan center, aiming to complete an orbital mission. However, the rocket, which carried a small satellite, failed to reach orbit due to mechanical malfunctions. OneSpace said in a statement on Tuesday that OS-M is a type of solid-propellant rocket with four stages. It is 19 meters long and weighs 20 metric tons when loaded with fuel and satellites. The booster is able to place satellites into orbit at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1,000 kilometers above the earth. Zhang Jie, chief designer of OS-M, said engineers have examined and tested the compatibility and stability of equipment mounted on the rocket and the launchpad. They have also verified the launch sequence, ground control and tracking procedures, he added. Established by Shu Chang, who has been dubbed China's Elon Musk, and several companions in 2015, OneSpace Technology has carried out two successful suborbital launches of its OS-X sounding rocket and has received huge amounts of investment from the capital market. The company aims to thrive in the burgeoning commercial space market in China. Since the beginning of China's space industry, the research and development of carrier rockets has been tightly held by State-owned enterprises. However, in the wake of private firms' rise in the global space sphere, the Chinese government has realized that it is necessary to introduce new players to stimulate innovation and competition and to fill gaps in the market left by State-owned contractors. President Xi Jinping has instructed the nation's long-insulated space industry to open its doors to private participants and take advantage of their participation to boost sustainable growth. Several government departments have published policies and guidelines that encourage private enterprises to take part in space-related businesses. As a result, nearly 10 private rocket firms have come into existence in China over the past three years. OneSpace, i-Space and LandSpace, all based in Beijing, have become leading firms when it comes to research and production capabilities, as well as funding. LandSpace and i-Space have also announced that they want to make at least one launch of their carrier rockets, but have yet to publish a schedule.", "overall-label": "tech"}

The older students, she says, are usually bankers and lawyers, who have collected Chinese ceramics for years and want to learn more about them. Elgood is the course director for postgraduate diploma studies in Asian art at SOAS. She says her teaching emphasizes two things: the direct touch her students from different parts of the world have with objects of art and the history of such works. In light of a new cooperation established between her university and the Guardian Education Center in Beijing, Elgood says she hopes her experience and expertise will also benefit Chinese collectors and art lovers. A subsidiary of the Beijing-based Guardian Group, the education center, along with SOAS and the Art Institute of Chicago, a large US museum, launched the international program in November. The program will offer both short- and long-term courses on art, art history and the market to artists, patrons and buyers, as well for others interested in art. A small class is expected to have about 20 students.,The Guardian Group also owns China Guardian Auctions, one of the country's top auctioneers, and Guardian Art Center in Beijing, which regularly hosts exhibitions. The first course will open in May on the overseas collections of ancient Chinese ceramics and bronze wares. Lecturers, including experts from Europe and the United States, will share their latest studies on major British collections of Chinese porcelain and US assemblages of Chinese bronze wares dating to the Shang (c. 16th century-11th century BC) and Zhou (c. 11th century-256 BC) dynasties. Wang Tao, curator of Chinese art at the Art Institute of Chicago, says he hopes potential students for the new program can first visit his museum to view the exhibition, Mirroring China's Past: Emperors and Their Bronzes. The display of archaic Chinese bronze will open on Feb 25 and provide glimpses of Bronze Age history.,Wang is also the museum's executive director of a program called Initiatives in Asia. He says Chinese visitors were a rapidly growing international audience group at the museum last year. He says the exhibition and the course together will shed new light on the research on the aesthetic value of Chinese bronze housed abroad and how the items have been passed down generations. Kou Qin, board chairman of the Guardian Education Center, says that besides the international program they will also offer courses on other art genres, such as classical Chinese painting, in cooperation with local cultural institutes. The center will also hold another course, on weekends from April to June 2018, introducing ink-brush masters of 20th-century Chinese art.,The rapid growth of the Chinese art market has boosted people's interest in art and collecting. There are speculators who seek short-term revenues but more buyers want to be serious collectors through systematic learning. Elgood says collectors should learn so they don't waste money and don't need to rely on dealers to buy for them. She hopes more Chinese appreciate the country's heritage and respect for the technical quality of its objects.

{"content": " To prepare for an arts school admission exam, Jiaojiao, a fifth-grader, has been on diet for a year. It is the third year in a row that the Hebei Vocational Art School has recruited students at the Duancun School in Duancun town of Anxin county, Hebei province, a seemingly unreachable dream before a ballet course was opened at the school. Jiaojiao is one of the girls practicing ballet under the guidance of Guan Yu, a professor from the Beijing Dance Academy.,At the invitation of an art charity, Guan started a ballet course at Duancun School in 2012 to offer rural children a chance to appreciate the artistic dance form. \"I hope art can be a part of their lives. I want them to be able to understand   whether they are a farmer or entrepreneur in the future,\" said Guan. His efforts were met with a cold shoulder at the beginning. Guan's ideal was considered too unpractical in the eyes of the students' parents. Many still believed that pursuing academic study and going to an academic college would be a better option for their children.,Guan had to persuade parents one by one to send their children to the ballet course. To show them the benefits of practicing ballet, Guan took his students to perform in prestigious schools and famous opera houses in Beijing. Guan believes the sense of honor that comes with the performances gradually changed the parents' attitudes. Seeing some students successfully admitted to arts colleges has also played a role in changing parents' minds.,In 2016, two students from the ballet course were admitted to the provincial art vocational school, which encouraged more parents to register their children in the course. Despite the fierce competition for a place in these arts schools, Guan said the ballet course provides an alternative for rural children in receiving higher education.", "overall-label": "education"}
{"content": "  An ongoing exhibition in Beijing brings together artists from China and Europe. Lin Qi reports. Three artists featured at the Bridging Asia-Europe exhibition series\u00a3\u00adWang Luyan from China, Gianni Dessi from Italy and Alois Mosbacher from Austria\u00a3\u00adshow how some artists who grew up in a less-globalized world still managed to develop individual styles and reshape the landscape of contemporary art. Bridging Asia-Europe, launched by The Parkview Museum in Beijing, is a series of exhibitions to encourage communication between Asian and European artists. The first show, now underway through Sept 17, teams up Wang, Dessi and Mosbacher, whose artworks are part of collections of George Wong, the museum's founder and an entrepreneur from Hong Kong. Through their paintings and installations, the three artists demonstrate distinctive approaches to topics in today's world, such as openness, freedom, traditions and respect. The series will include exhibitions by other artists as well. Lorand Hegyi, the current exhibition's Hungarian curator, says the three artists were all born in the early 1950s, a period when the world was divided into two \"antagonistic hemispheres\". \"Their generation witnessed many critical events of the Cold War. When the three artists became active in the 1980s, they staged (works) on the platform of multicultural globalization.\",  Hegyi, 63, is also from that generation. The art historian and critic has been focusing on contemporary art from central and Eastern Europe. He says the artists of his generation, like the three on show, were able to create a globalized discourse that was based on the concept of different identities. Their works communicate between the East and the West and bring people a \"touching and comforting experience\", he says. Wang is known for producing paintings that are as precisely executed as an engineering project. Hegyi says that, underneath these seemingly mechanical lines in Wang's works, viewers can sense \"irrational and self-destructive\" tendencies of the subjects he focuses on and addresses the paradoxical status of many people. In his shown work W Screw, Wang says he sees the object as \"a spiritual totem that does not fit in with the filth of the real world\". He conveys an isolation from his surroundings and a powerful desire for difference.,  In another shown painting, Birdcage, he draws an intricate birdcage to invite the audience to think about whether the boundary between freedom and confinement has blurred. Dessi shows a group of blue watercolor works on paper he completed earlier this year. He says the works belong to his ongoing series, China Suite. He says he chose blue because the Yangtze River is referred to as the Blue River in Italy. For the series, he poured blue colored water on a stack of paper and let the pigment slowly seep into it. He created this based on how natural traces are left on things by water. With this, he says he hopes to show both time and water as two generative forces of life. According to Hegyi, Dessi gives voice to the romantics of our day by formulating dramatic visual metaphors in his works, and hails a \"spiritual resistance\" against emptiness and indifference. In Mosbacher's oil paintings, he creates a poetic, sometimes puzzling feeling by portraying landscapes of a forest, a field and arrangements of tree trunks. For example in his painting Nine Trees, he simply painted nine trees, and modeled them after real photos he had taken in forests.,  Unlike a real forest in which trees grow naturally, Mosbacher arranged the trees in his work in a neat, artificial way, as if they were elements of a program. Hegyi says those unnatural scenes portrayed in Mosbacher's works are a metaphor of the chaotic side of the real world, and he urges his viewers to confront their own hidden universes. \"Like Mosbacher, one will find in himself a forgotten but still vivid and effective empire full of unlimited imagination.\" Contact the writer at linqi@chinadaily.com.cn 11 am-7 pm, daily through Sept 17.

{"content": "Xia An'an, a young man from Central China's Hubei province who was born deaf, got admitted into Beijing Union University this year. But his story is much more than that. Some 13 years ago, Xia left his hometown for Wuhan, capital city of Hubei, for a better education. Together with him were his grandparents, who have since been taking care of him. In a special education school, hearing impaired students including Xia have to work even harder. Being unable to listen to explanations from teachers means putting more effort into blackboard notes, especially in physics and mathematics. Xia and his 11 classmates have all been admitted to top domestic universities like Beijing Union University. This university is one of the country's top 12 for disabled students. The exams were conducted one by one inside these universities from late March to early April. But the exams for Xia and his classmates were not easy.

{"content": "Beijing's construction regulatory body confirmed on Thursday that transformation of five existing venues for the 2022 Winter Olympics has started with an emphasis on diversifying their post-Games functions. The National Indoor Stadium in Beijing's Olympic Park has drifted away from the athletic spotlight since it was taken over in 2010 by the Beijing Performance and Arts Group, mainly a host for concerts and shows. The stadium, built for gymnastics, trampoline and handball for the 2008 Summer Olympics, is now buzzing with activity to prepare it as the venue for men's ice hockey events in the 2022 Olympics. The stadium and nearby National Aquatics Center or Water Cube are among the five existing venues in downtown Beijing being transformed for competition and noncompetition purposes at the 2022 Games, according to the Beijing Major Projects Construction Headquarters Office. \"The transformation of all five venues will be implemented sticking to core principles of cost-efficiency, energy savings, high-tech and sustainability,\" said Huang Hui, director of the office's urban construction department. \"The venues will be able not only to host winter and summer sports competitions but also stage various events to serve the public and commercial purposes.\" The indoor stadium, with a capacity of 18,000, will use a water-source heat pump system for temperature control and cooling for its ice rink. It will be more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly due to extracting or dissipating heat using water, according to the office. Other major upgrades include the replacement of some of the venue's current structures with glass walls, to maximize natural lighting, and a new air-purifying system. The aquatics center, used for swimming and diving for the 2008 Games, will become an ice cube to host the curling competition for 2022, with the transformation to be completed in the second half of 2019, according to the venue owner. \"To transform a summer sport venue into a curling arena capable of hosting ice-based sports and entertainment activities helps diversify the functions and revenue sources of this facility,\" said Yang Qiyong, general manager of the center. The changes involve filling the pool with steel structures, leveling the ground with a retractable layer of concrete and producing ice surfaces. After completion of upgrades in power supply, humidity control and cooling systems, it will take about a month to switch it to ice or to return it to a swimming pool. However, the venue team has to overcome challenges in temperature control to keep the ground cold enough for ice while the upper layers stay warm enough for spectators, Yang said. As the oldest of 26 venues for 2022 in three zones - downtown Beijing, Yanqing district and co-host Zhangjiakou - the Capital Gymnasium, built in 1968, will stage short-track speed skating and figure skating at the Winter Olympics after having played host to commercial skating shows such as 2016 Amazing on Ice. The transformation will focus on upgrading the venue's interior and the sound and lighting systems while maintaining its time-honored exterior look, according to the plan. The upgrades of three more Beijing 2008 venues - the National Stadium or Bird's Nest, the Wukesong Arena and the National Conventional Center - will take place in 2020. They will be repurposed, respectively, for the 2022 opening and closing ceremonies, women's ice hockey and media operations. ", "overall-label": "life-style"}
{"content": "From the revamp of landscape lighting along a 20-kilometer section of the Huangpu River, to the training of 5,000 volunteers ready to greet the crowds, Shanghai is ready to impress the world with the inaugural China International Import Expo. With the slogan New Era, Shared Future, the world's first import-themed national-level expo is scheduled to open on Nov 5. The event is set to gather more than 3,000 exhibitors from over 130 countries, as well as political dignitaries, business leaders and heads of international organizations from around 150 countries and regions. \"We are ready to work with all relevant parties and make concerted efforts to ensure the first China International Import Expo is a great success and a first-class international event,\" Vice-Minister of Commerce Fu Ziying told a news conference in Beijing earlier this week. Running at the National Exhibition and Convention Center (Shanghai) until Nov 10, the CIIE is foremost an exhibition to strengthen business ties and provide foreign companies wider access to the immense Chinese market. The latest figures from the Ministry of Commerce show that a total of 82 countries and three international organizations will showcase their economic and trade achievements as well as featured products in a combined exhibition area of 30,000 square meters at the Country Pavilion for Trade and Investment at the expo. Twelve guest of honor countries will have their own characteristic pavilions, including the United Kingdom, Russia, Germany, Canada, South Africa and Pakistan. \"The UK is very excited about the possibilities the CIIE presents,\" said James Sassoon, chairman of the China-Britain Business Council, during an interview with the CIIE Bureau. \"So it has very good commitment from the government and business. And it's because we want to show off the best we have, whether it's in automotive, tourism, healthcare or creative industry, there is so much that the UK has to present right across the board,\" he said. At the Enterprise and Business Exhibition, a long list of Fortune Global 500 businesses, among other overseas companies, will show off their eye-catching new products and state-of-the-art technologies over a total booth area of 270,000 sq m. The area, already expanded twice from the original plans, will be equivalent to the size of 38 football pitches and can house more than 160,000 domestic and international buyers. \"CIIE, with strong support from the top Chinese leadership, will be a unique platform to guarantee a more open environment for international participation in China's economic growth by importing more of the latest technologies and ideas,\" said Kjeld Stark, president of Danfoss China. Danish multinational Danfoss Group is a global leader in providing green solutions for the climate, energy, food and infrastructure sectors. \"CIIE is a good indicator that China will accelerate its development by adopting Western technologies at a faster pace. This gives us more confidence in China's economy,\" he said. Meanwhile, Bayer's exhibits at CIIE will focus on health and nutrition, showcasing some of the German multinational company's latest research results and development concepts in pharmaceuticals, consumer health, crop science and animal health businesses. \"CIIE is a signature event for the Chinese government that highlights and supports China's policy and aim of further opening-up to the world,\" said Celina Chew, president of Bayer Group China. \"We expect to meet representatives of many diverse and exciting countries, companies, businesses and organizations with an interest in China, and look forward to exchanging ideas and finding opportunities for collaboration,\" she said.,Besides bustling business exchanges, the expo will serve as a platform for strengthening partnership in international free trade, while acting as a confidence booster for economic globalization and a countermeasure against protectionism. According to the Ministry of Commerce, the expo will feature a forum on the global economy and trade, with a star-studded lineup to provide their thoughts on shared prosperity. The Hongqiao International Economic and Trade Forum, with the theme \"spurring new vitality of global trade, creating an open and win-win scenario\", will be attended by over 2,000 government officials, international organization leaders, renowned entrepreneurs and academics from over 130 countries and regions. Speakers and panelists will include Alibaba's Jack Ma, Microsoft co-founder and TerraPower Chairman Bill Gates, and Angel Gurria, secretary-general of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The forum's three parallel sessions, focusing on trade and opening-up, trade and innovation, and trade and investment, respectively, will discuss major issues such as the new impetus for economic globalization, and the liberalization and facilitation of trade and investment. With only three days to go before the most significant event to follow the 2010 World Expo, Shanghai has been fine-tuning preparations for the upcoming import expo and is ready to welcome guests from across the world. Publicity covering the CIIE can be seen in almost every corner of the financial metropolis, and the new look Shanghai has put on for the expo has become the talk of the town. Light decorations have been added to a 20-km stretch of the city's signature Huangpu River, as well as four bridges that span it. Hundreds of thousands of pots of flowers now adorn the city. Shanghai has also trained 5,000 volunteers, who will offer various services including translation. At Shanghai Pudong International Airport, round-the-clock foreign language translation services have been put in place since late September. \"More than 20 volunteers who can speak a total of 12 foreign languages, including English, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, Russian, French, Arabian and Italian, are ready to offer help to our foreign visitors,\" said Shi Zhiying from the service center team at Pudong airport. To ease road traffic congestion and ensure the smooth running of the expo, the municipal government has announced plans to move two working days. The first two days of the expo, Nov 5 and 6, have been designated public holidays, with Nov 3 and 11 set as working days to compensate. Shanghai residents said they are looking forward to the positive changes that the event is expected to bring. \"Many foreign brands have entered China for the first time at the expo, and that is a good business opportunity,\" said Yang Xiaolan, a student at Shanghai International Studies University. \"I hope the expo can create more jobs for Shanghai and the whole country.\" Wu Yanwen, a senior student at Tongji University, said: \"With CIIE, Shanghai residents will be exposed to more imported items, thus having a wider choice of quality products. I also hope more people can learn more about Shanghai and Chinese culture, and how we are marching toward the 'Chinese dream'.\"", "overall-label": "business"}
{"content": "With their success in popularizing mobile internet applications in China's massive consumer market, local companies are striving to establish a beachhead in the industrial internet, a new front widely recognized as key to integrating the digital and real economies. For example, Haier Group, China's largest home appliance maker has built an industrial internet platform, a network of industrial apps that collect and analyze data from consumers, suppliers and factories boasting machines with internet-connected sensors. The system, COSMOPlat, is designed to allow companies to customize products at speed and scale while boosting productivity and cutting costs. Chen Lucheng, vice-president of Haier, said in addition to making Haier's own factories more flexible, the industrial internet system is empowering companies by bringing them closer to consumers and suppliers The platform involved 320 million users and 3.9 million enterprises last year, covering electronics, textiles, equipment, construction, transportation and chemical engineering. Based on the open platform, Haier has also launched a string of internet-connected smart factories around the country, hoping to boost efficiency. Zhang Ruimin, chairman and CEO of Haier, said the most important characteristic of the internet era is the zero-distance relationship with consumers, highlighting the importance of integrating users and enterprises in the new manufacturing age. Haier's move is part of broader efforts by Chinese companies to drive digital transformation on the nation's sprawling assembly lines. The push is fueled by strong government policy support as well as manufacturers' desire to upgrade their plants. Former Vice-Premier Ma Kai said in a speech earlier this year that the industrial internet has become a new battlefield for global manufacturing and technology companies. The sector remains in its infancy, but it is gaining importance as it provides an opportunity to further enhance China's manufacturing prowess. The State Council unveiled a guideline in November that aims to build three to five industrial internet platforms, which will reach international standards by 2025, and lead the world in key areas by 2035. Specifically, China will build around 10 cross-industry platforms by 2020 to accelerate digital transformation at enterprises. China also aims to encourage over 300,000 industrial enterprises to move their business to cloud platforms and cultivate more than 300,000 industrial apps by the end of 2020. Qianzhan Industry Research Institute forecast that the market size of China's industrial internet sector will reach 10.8 trillion yuan ($1.64 trillion) in 2025, without disclosing the figure for this year. \"Accelerated steps on the industrial internet are of significance to China's advanced manufacturing amid fierce competition from abroad. It will help promote the deeper integration of the nation's real economy with the internet, big data and artificial intelligence,\" said Yang Chunli, a researcher at the China Center for Information Industry Development, a Beijing-based think tank. \"To compete globally in the internet and manufacturing, China must foster national platforms, which will act as the main pillars of future industrial transformation. Key industries such as automobiles, digital, energy and aerospace are some of the potential areas in which to establish such national platforms,\" Yang added. The view was echoed by Qu Xianming, an expert with the National Manufacturing Strategy Advisory Committee. Qu said that as China promotes the in-depth incorporation of technological advances with socio-economic development, innovation will account for an increasingly large part of the real economy. \"Industrial growth will benefit considerably from the strategy, which can drive the long-predicted convergence of the IT and industrial fields in China,\" Qu said. According to the 2017 report of the World Intellectual Property Organization, China is the only middle-income country among the world's top 25 most innovative economies, where it is ranked 22nd. China now has more researchers than the United States, outspends the European Union in research and development, and \"is on track to beat all other nations in its yearly production of scientific papers\", the science magazine Nature reported. But more efforts are required to leverage such technological and innovative prowess to drive the nation's real economy. The industrial internet is an efficient way of injecting such innovation into the manufacturing of consumer electronics, automobiles, clothing and other items, Qu added. According to a recent report from the Alliance of Industrial Internet, China's industrial internet sector is still in its infancy, as a group of Chinese companies, including Sany Heavy Industry Co Ltd, started tapping into the sector several years ago. Last year, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, China's top industry regulator, selected 206 smart manufacturing pilot projects, of which 28 are related to industrial internet innovation. Now, around 50 percent of the world's industrial platforms are provided by US companies and China still faces a gap with developed countries in terms of the function, degree of commercialization and integrity of the overall ecosystem, according to the report. Yang from the China Center for Information Industry Development also noted that a group of companies including China Aerospace Science and Industry Corp, the nation's largest missile maker, and Haier did quite well in industrial internet but some of them focus on certain vertical areas with limited users and resources, which still lag behind world-leading platforms such as General Electric's Predix and Siemens' MindSphere. \"However, most industrial platforms across the world are in the early stage of commercialization and are still exploring the market. In other words, China stands almost at the same starting point as developed countries,\" Yang said. \"Even though some companies have started to map out the industrial internet, they have just launched their products and the service system still needs to be improved,\" she added. In addition to traditional manufacturing companies, telecom carriers are also entering the field. China United Network Communications Group Co, the nation's second-largest mobile carrier by subscribers, established a new unit at Xiongan New Area earlier this year, as part of its broader effort to help build it into a high-tech and smart area. China Unicom Xiongan Industrial Internet Co Ltd, as the new company is called, is designed to co-ordinate innovative business teams and related resources such as cloud computing, big data, internet of things, and the industrial internet for Xiongan New Area. Hao Liqian, chairman of the new company, said China Unicom aims to build globally pioneering network infrastructure and application platforms in Xiongan. Yu Xiaohui, chief engineer at the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, a government think tank affiliated with the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, said a key source of innovation will be smart manufacturing driven by big data. \"Two years ago, big data was chiefly used to help companies do targeted advertising or recommend personalized news in the consumer market,\" Yu says. \"But now the global industry has reached a consensus that big data is the core to powering the new industrial revolution.\"", "overall-label": "business"}
