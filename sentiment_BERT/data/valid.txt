{"content": "  For two days in a row recently, Peking Opera master Du Jinfang used a hearing aid to listen to speeches about the struggling art form at the ongoing 7th Beijing International Film Festival. After the speeches, the 85-year-old artist was a bit tired, but she was excited about the progress made by the Peking Opera Film Project, which brings together top opera companies and movie studios to convert classic shows into feature-length movies. \"I began to learn the opera as a 6-year-old, and took leads at 16. But most of the performers nowadays are in their 30s. We are short of replacements,\" she says. \"But thanks to the project, young performers will be encouraged and the opera will be revived,\" she adds. Since 2011, the project has led to the production of 10 movies, such as     and  . And six of them have been screened at international film festivals, bagging 13 awards.,  The project envisages the production of another 10 such movies in the next three years. From the six award winners,  \u00a3\u00ada 2,200-year-ago romance about a hero and his lover\u00a3\u00adhas been screened in the United States, Japan, Britain, New Zealand and Australia, and will be screened in more foreign countries in the next few months. Opera buffs in Beijing will also get a chance to savor the classics. As part of the Beijing film festival's Peking Opera section, all the movies are being screened in three cinemas in Beijing's Chaoyang district. The opera movies will be screened in the mornings for free in these theaters for the rest of this year, according to the festival organizers. With this new initiative, the total number of screenings could hit 500. Celebrities, critics and filmmakers see the project\u00a3\u00adthe largest of its kind in New China's history\u00a3\u00adas a new chapter for the art form, which goes back more than 200 years.,  Li Enjie, head of the Jingju Theater Company of Beijing, says Peking Opera dates back to 1790 when troupes from Anhui province brought the opera to Beijing to mark the birthday of then-emperor Qianlong, a turning point for the art form. Interestingly, the links between Peking Opera and cinema go back to 1905, when the first Chinese movie   was made. The 30-minute movie, based on the 14th-century novel  was a recording of an opera show performed by then-celebrity artist Tan Xinpei. Movies based on Peking Opera featuring top performers were box-office hits in the 1930s and 1940s, and hit a new high in the 1960s and 1970s with the so-called yangbanxi (revolutionary model dramas). However, as pop culture took hold, the following for traditional opera died. But Li believes cinema can help Peking Opera regain its popularity, a view shared by others.,  Liu Changyu, a famous Peking Opera artist, says: \"The big screen can highlight facial expressions, gestures and relevant details to give the audience a clearer view of the performance. \"Also, as seats in traditional theaters are limited, the cinematic versions can overcome the limitations of time and space, and give classic performances immortality. \"So, even though the artists pass away, the essence of their performances can be preserved.\" Echoing her words, Ma Chongjie, director of the Peking Opera films   and  says such movies are a treasure for future generations.  is about a female official from the Tang Dynasty (618-907) who serves the Empress Wu Zetian, while   is an unlikely story about revenge. Focusing on the challenges faced in making such movies, Ma says: \"The main issues for the crews are how to shoot such a film and what content to keep out.\",  Typically, most of the classic shows, selected by a 21-consultant team run for around three hours on stage, but a movie usually lasts for around two hours. Ma says a Peking Opera movie director has to be familiar with music, characters and drama structure to make the correct cuts. Praising the ongoing Peking Opera Film Project, Cui Wei, the secretary-general of China Theater Association, says while in the past, such movies were produced by just one theater company and one studio, the State-backed effort has led to the teaming up of top talent, with most of the movies boasting an all-celebrity cast. \"Audiences can now see performances from different schools (of Peking Opera) in one movie,\" says Cui. Wang Xiaoxin, a veteran scriptwriter and researcher, says Peking Opera films will also appeal to foreign audiences.", "overall-label": "life-style"}
{"content": "Government authorities, alongside experts from home and abroad, are calling for more international cooperation to promote the sustainable development of online public services and governance at the fifth World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, Zhejiang province. The development of information and communication technologies has influenced every dimension of society, including the way the government interacts with citizens. The advent of electronic governance has advanced management reform. At 11 am on Oct 1, the Safe Beijing Sina Weibo micro-blog account advised its 12.5 million followers to be careful about the driving routes they selected since the weeklong National Day holiday would see millions of travelers from all over the country pour into Beijing, and tourist attractions and surrounding areas would likely be clogged with severe traffic congestion. Safe Beijing posted about 60 messages, detailing road closures, traffic updates, safety information and news stories, throughout the holiday. The posts were forwarded and commented on by the account's followers. One post - in response to an incident at a Beijing shopping mall in which three women snatched a baby from his stroller - was forwarded over 290,000 times. Safe Beijing is a new tool for Beijing's public security bureau, the city's primary police force. Online-governance services like Safe Beijing seek to increase the use of internet technologies to promote interaction among officials, citizens and businesses, and increase social services' availability, transparency and efficiency. Internet Plus governance was, for the first time, included in the government work report of the 2015 two sessions - the annual meeting of the country's top legislature and advisory body, the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. The State Council, China's Cabinet, then issued a guideline to promote the initiative and improve government services' quality and efficiency. Government bodies at all levels across the country have opened a total of more than 170,000 accounts on Sina Weibo, over 500,000 on WeChat and about 20,000 portals to improve administration, Xinhua News Agency reported in June. \"We're living in the internet age,\" says Renmin University professor of public administration and policy Fang Zhenbang. \"Using online tools to facilitate public services is an important step to accelerate governance reform, since the internet is the fastest and most convenient way for the government to interact with, and provide services for, the public.\" E-governance is not only crucial to streamlining administration, strengthening supervision and optimizing services but is also important for transforming government functions, improving efficiency and transparency, and stimulating market vitality and social creativity, Fang says. It's not limited to government organs in the more-developed cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, but has also been growing in popularity in other parts of China in recent years. The government of Karamay in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region has developed its e-governance initiative since 2013, focused on informing citizens and promoting interaction. The local government built a website named \"smart community\" that integrates basic data from departments like public security, education, health, civil affairs and tourism. The portal enables residents to find the information they need online rather than actually visit government offices. \"We see the platform play an important role, especially in medical treatment,\" says Ye Yuantuan, deputy director of the Karamay Cloud Computing Industrial Park, which provides data to support the \"smart community\". \"For example, if a patient needs an emergency blood transfusion, medical staff can use the platform to quickly find a donor with the right blood type and rapidly reach that volunteer.\" The platform also monitors such data as water, electricity and gas that's closely related to residents' daily lives, which enables the government to better care for the elderly. Community authorities visit retirees' homes if there are any abnormalities to make sure they're safe, Ye says. China had 802 million internet users and 470 million online-government-service users as of June, the China Internet Network Information Center reports. That's about 60 percent of all internet users in the country. While traditional e-governance applications have been infused into people's daily lives, government departments have started to use the latest social-networking services, such as Douyin, known as Tik Tok overseas, to reach wider audiences and expand services. Douyin was founded as a streaming service for music, gaming and dance videos in September 2016. Its popularity has skyrocketed since it diversified its content to include gourmet food, exercise, travel and culture. It attracted more than 150 million active daily users and 300 million a month between January and June. Over 40 percent were aged 24 to 30, the company says. Douyin's surging growth has encouraged more than 2,800 government departments and media organizations, including the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission and People.cn, to open accounts, according to the company's report in August. Shaanxi province's capital, Xi'an, has come to be known as Douyin's \"celebrity city\" because of the number of videos created there that have gone viral. The platform says its more than 610,000 short videos about the city had been watched more than 3.6 billion times by the end of April. Xi'an's tourism arrivals grew by nearly 40 percent year-on-year and tourism revenue increased by about 50 percent during the Tomb Sweeping Day holiday in April, the city's tourism development commission reports. Government-related Douyin accounts posted 100,000 videos that received more than 50 billion hits in the first nine months of the year, according to Beijing Byte-Dance Technology, a news and information-content provider. Chinese Academy of Governance professor of public management, Zhu Lijia, says the government is constantly working to improve communications. \"The government has kept pace with every new internet product, and every new media platform has enabled it to build a more approachable and interactive image,\" Zhu says. \"Many social issues have been resolved thanks to public exposure on internet platforms. People have places to comment, and the government hears their voices.\" The 2018 United Nations E-Government Survey ranked China 34th among 193 countries and regions around the world in terms of the availability of online services in e-governance. China can learn from the top 10 countries, including neighbors, the Republic of Korea and Japan, Zhu says. Exploring new communication modes should be encouraged. But government departments should ultimately plan for long-term operations and not open accounts because of peer pressure or as vanity projects, Zhu adds.", "overall-label": "tech"}

{"content": "A music teacher is working to make the ancient Chinese zither popular with young people. Chen Nan reports. The world premiere of seven musical pieces by Chinese composers was at the concert Music Contemporary From China 2018 at Alice Tully Hall of the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York in late January. The composers are all faculty members of the Beijing-based Central Conservatory of Music. The piece, also performed by musicians from the conservatory, featured both traditional Chinese instruments and Western instruments. \"The new works have different styles and guzheng (Chinese zither) is capable of making versatile sounds,\" says Ji Wei, a player of the instrument and an associate professor at the Central Conservatory of Music. \"I was very excited and couldn't wait to share the new music with the audience in the United States,\" Ji says of her preparations in Beijing before the concert of Jan 27. Ji, 39, began to learn the ancient plucked instrument as a child and recalls how audiences were curious about guzheng when she first performed abroad in Japan and the United States in the early 1990s. \"Even while I was in an elevator with my guzheng placed next to me, people who entered the elevator would ask me about it,\" Ji says. Now, she says more composers are interested in the instrument and are willing to write music for it, which has kept guzheng alive as well as expanded its repertoire in recent times. Before the concert in New York, Ji had performed with the Vienna University Philharmonic at the Musikverein in Vienna on Dec 11 in a concert, which was the European premiere of composer Vijay Upadhyaya's new work, the 75-minute Chang'an Men. Upadhyaya, an Indian-born, Vienna-based composer was commissioned to produce the piece by the China National Symphony Orchestra.,Speaking about Ji, Upadhyaya says: \"She is one of the most accomplished and professional guzheng players in China and the world. I was lucky to have her as a soloist in my composition. Actually, I needed to consult her sometimes regarding the technical details of the instrument while composing.\" Meanwhile, the Chinese musician has been delving into traditional music as well as finding new sounds for her instrument. Speaking about her work, Ji says: \"What I want to do is to display the beauty of the instrument by playing classic guzheng pieces, such as A Moonlit Night on the Spring River, The Evening Song of Fishermen, High Mountain and Flowing Water, and to bring the modern side of the instrument to people, who may have ignored its potential.\" In 2005, Ji made history when the classical recording label Deutsche Grammophon published its first-ever guzheng piece At Night on the Lake Beneath the Maple Bridge, featuring her performance with world-renowned Chinese pianist Lang Lang. Ji has also recorded dozens of solo albums and has authored textbooks and played with top ensembles around the globe. Born in Shijiazhuang, Hebei province, Ji started to learn to play the instrument at the age of 5 at a local art training school as her working-class parents wanted their only child to receive art education. Then, the guzheng was not commonly seen in cities in China. \"The instrument was expensive and my mother drew the strings of guzheng on a piece of paper for me to practice at home. I could only play the real guzheng at the school,\" recalls Ji. \"For me, a shy young girl then, the instrument was very expressive.\" In 1992, she was admitted to the middle school attached to the China Conservatory of Music in Beijing and Wang Zhongshan, one of the best-known guzheng musicians, was her teacher. After graduation she obtained her master's degree from the Central Conservatory of Music in 2004 before starting to teach there. Ji was interested in blending the traditional instrument with modern sounds even as a student. \"I am interested in working with musicians of different styles and that's the best way to promote guzheng as well as discovering the potential of the instrument through collaboration,\" says Ji, who has participated in workshops held by international conservatories. Before her master's degree was complete, Ji was invited to perform in a concert with French electronic music artist Jean Michel Jarre at the Forbidden City in Beijing. To popularize the instrument among the young, Ji initiated a guzheng ensemble in 2008, which has since gathered students from the Central Conservatory of Music and gives performances at venues like the National Centre for the Performing Arts and Beijing Concert Hall. \"I decided to become a teacher when I was a young student. I want to inspire my students, too. It can be very exciting to challenge them to find something new while remaining rooted in traditional Chinese music,\" she says.", "overall-label": "life-style"}

{"content": "Many consider some American-born Chinese as \"banana people\", who are viewed as \"yellow outside but white inside\". But Fred Engst also jokes he can be likened to an \"egg\" instead - \"white\" outside like Westerners, but \"yellow\" inside and devoted to China. The 59-year-old American was born in Beijing as the first child of Erwin Engst, known as Yang Zao in China, and Joan Hinton, or Han Chun, who arrived in the country in the 1940s to help agricultural development.  Fred Engst spent his first 22 years in China and was named Yang Heping.  Heping means \"peace\" in Chinese. Soong Ching Ling, the wife of modern China's founding father Sun Yat-sen, met the pregnant Hinton at the Asian Pacific Peace Conference in Beijing in 1952 and suggested the name. Fred Engst's mother was a former scientist who worked on the Manhattan Project's atom bomb. But she was extremely shocked and quit the project when the US government dropped bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan in 1945.  Hinton arrived in Shanghai in 1948 and went to Yan'an, Shaanxi province, where she married Erwin Engst, who had been working with the Party since 1946. The couple participated vigorously in China's efforts to build a socialist economy and worked extensively in agriculture.  Fred Engst himself was determined to settle down in the Chinese capital again and became a teacher at the University of International Business and Economics in 2007, after more than three decades in his parents' home country where the people were the same as him \"in appearance\". \"I can only feel at home here (in China),\" the economics professor says. \"I can easily tell right from wrong in China and can form my own opinion easily to evaluate a new social phenomenon, but I don't have a steering wheel in America,\" says Engst, who speaks in fast, pure Mandarin. \"I just have no emotional grounds for judgments.\"  The difficulty of finding like-minded people was the last push that forced Engst to return to his birthplace.  If not for his daughters, Engst would never have thought of spending this summer vacation in the United States. It will be the first time he is visiting family since he returned to China. \"Few Americans have interests in issues that I am concerned about, like the socialist economy and the 'cultural revolution' (1966-1976). But here, I can have access to rich resources, books or witnesses,\" Engst says.  Engst says he is enjoying compiling his parents' records as well as reviewing and researching topics about his bygone days in China - between the 1950s and 1974 when he left China for the first time to the US out of curiosity. Engst spent his childhood in the Caotan dairy farm in Xi'an, capital of Shaanxi, before his parents were transferred to work in Beijing in 1965.  In 1969, when he was 17, Engst was appointed as a worker in the Beijing Guanghua Wood Processing Factory. The \"equal and harmonious relationship with comrades in the factory\" was a special time for him.  Engst says he had to struggle for more than three decades in the US, but the experience also made him realize why his parents believed in communism so firmly. \"As part of the generation who suffered World War II, they witnessed and understood clearly that capitalism would inevitably lead to imperialism, which would then unavoidably result in war,\" Engst says.", "overall-label": "life-style"}

New Zealand and China are good friends and partners, and New Zealand positively regards the prospect of China's development while being committed to strengthening the partnership and cooperation, he said. Key made a six-day visit to Beijing as prime minister in April 2016. Li, during his visit to New Zealand in March, met for talks with new Prime Minister Bill English. The two countries opened negotiations in April on upgrading their free trade agreement. The second round of negotiations was held in Beijing this month, focusing on customs procedures, trade facilitation, e-commerce and agricultural cooperation. In New Zealand, former officials have a strong influence, and Thursday's meeting can be seen as a step forward in bilateral ties, especially with additional negotiations, said Chen Fengying, a senior researcher on the world economy at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations. In 2008, New Zealand became the first developed economy to sign a free-trade agreement with China, focusing on commodity trading and not including trade in services, Chen said. \"High-level interactions between the two countries have set an example for China's exchanges with developed economies,\" she said.", "overall-label": "politics"}

{"content": "The Beijing subway system plans to introduce bio-recognition technology at stations this year to improve transport efficiency and reduce costs, a senior manager said last week. Two bio-recognition technologies\u00a3\u00adfacial recognition and palm touch\u00a3\u00adare being considered, said Zhang Huabing, head of enterprise development for Beijing Subway, the operator of most lines in the city, during the International Metro Transit Exhibition in Beijing on Thursday. Facial recognition technology can track passenger movements with cameras connected to online networks that recognize people when they enter a station, potentially allowing them to bypass traditional ticketing. \"The technique aims to reduce transit time when passengers enter the station,\" said Wang Jianwei, director of the railway business department at tech giant Huawei, which has installed facial recognition technology in its factory. Wang said the technology is mature and can be widely applied in the subway system, but how passengers will pay for tickets remains a problem. The Shanghai subway system currently uses biological recognition technology. Passengers can swipe their hands to gain entry at gate machines. The hand images are immediately compared with files in a background database, said Li Weizhen, marketing director of Shanghai Zhangteng Information Technology. According to Shanghai Metro passenger rules, six special groups of people, including disabled soldiers, retired cadres, blind people, veterans, families of wartime martyrs and wounded police officers can use the subways free. Shanghai promoted the palm vein technology for the special groups on its Pujiang Line in March. Beijing has 22 urban railway lines totaling 608 kilometers. More than 10 million passengers ride the city's subway trains every weekday. In 2016, the 15 lines operated by Beijing Subway transported people on more than 3 billion trips, up by 6.8 percent year-on-year, according to information on the company's website. Liu Xiaoming, vice-minister of transport, said in a news conference that 96 subway stations in Beijing\u00a3\u00adone-fourth of the total\u00a3\u00adhad implemented measures limiting passengers during peak hours. \"Some stations had to adopt the measures to reduce the heavy passenger flow because the station area is too small and transfers are difficult,\" he said. \"Especially during morning and evening peak hours, long lines form at the station entrances.\" \"Predicting passenger flow needs to be strengthened,\" he added.", "overall-label": "tech"}

{"content": "After successful staging in China of Dream of the Red Chamber, Canadian impresario plans to take it on a major tour of Europe. Andrew Moody reports. As a Canadian classical music impresario, Wray Armstrong might cut an unlikely figure in the projection of China's soft power. The 67-year-old, however, was the man behind the recent hugely successful staging in China of Dream of the Red Chamber, based on the classic Chinese novel. And he plans to take it on a major tour of Europe in the summer of 2019. He believes it is the sort of project that fits into the message about the importance of promoting Chinese culture sent out by President Xi Jinping in his report to the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in October. \"President Xi has been very strong about culture and soft power, and following on from the congress we are looking at taking it to Europe,\" he says. Armstrong, an imposingly tall figure, was sitting behind an enormous desk in his new office at the North Pingod Arts Community in Beijing. The table is made out of a 100-year-old Chinese country house door, which is now encased in toughened glass. \"I had it made by a carpenter in the Gaobeidian district of Beijing where we get a lot of our props for historical dramas. They had to put it together in my office. It is a bit of an artistic statement,\" he laughs. Armstrong is chairman of Armstrong Music and Arts, which he founded in the Chinese capital in 2009., He represents a number of the world's leading classical music artists, including the Polish composer and conductor Krzyszt Penderecki, the pianist Helene Grimaud and violinist Joshua Bell. He also represented the Czech conductor Jiri Belohlavek until his death earlier this year. Staging Dream of the Red Chamber in China though was his biggest success so far. The production of the opera, composed by Chinese-American Bright Sheng and with a libretto by Sheng and Chinese-American scriptwriter David Henry Hwang, is not Chinese but that of the San Francisco Opera. \"It wasn't produced for the China market but by San Francisco Opera, which has a strong commissioning program and tends to commission something by a Chinese artist every five years or so. \"Its board of directors really hoped it would come to China and we were one of two or three agencies who bid on the project.\" There were six performances in total, two each in Beijing, Wuhan and Changsha. The first performance at the last venue marked the opening of the Changsha Meixi Lake International Culture and Arts Center designed by the late British architect Zaha Hadid. \"In Changsha the acoustics were brilliant and the look is completely different and wonderful. The center looks like orchid blossoms when seen from above,\" he says. Although it was a US production, many of the artists had to be hired in China. \"The San Francisco orchestra was in season and they don't have a double orchestra or chorus like, say, Vienna (Philharmonic and State Opera). So we auditioned with the composer and hired the best young Chinese singers. They had all trained in London or worked in Berlin,\" he says. All the performances were a sell-out with Wuhan's being broadcast on local television; and now Armstrong is looking to stage the opera in Shanghai next year before heading for Europe the following year. \"If we could do between six and 10 centers that would be unbelievable. We would like to do the music festivals in Berlin and Amsterdam, the Proms in London, although the Royal Albert Hall (the main Proms venue) is not an opera house, and maybe the Edinburgh Festival and the Proms in Warsaw,\" he says., He says San Francisco Opera prefers his company to stage a European tour even though it is outside China. \"They know and we also know it would require an incredible fund-raising effort, which would be easier inside China than organized from San Francisco. Both the Chinese Central Opera and the Hangzhou Philharmonic would be very interested in cooperating with us and we hope we might get some government support.\" Armstrong was brought up in a musical family in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. His mother was a good amateur pianist and his father played an accordion and had a traditional dance band.  He studied languages at university and went on to be a translator for the Federal Translation Bureau in Ottawa. \"On the third day of the job as a translator I knew it wasn't going to work - just translating what people said with no viewpoint.\" In the late 1970s he managed to get the job of assistant manager at the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, where he eventually became managing director working alongside musical director Andrew Davis, now best known for his association with the Proms in London. In the early 1990s, he became managing director of the London operations for the leading US arts management company ICM Artists, where he worked with Isaac Stern, who had made the film Mao to Mozart about classical music returning to China after the \"cultural revolution\" (1966-76). In 1999, he moved to IMG Artists, where he headed up the key classical music projects at the Beijing Olympics. He has had a close working relationship with the famous Chinese conductor Yu Long since the late 1990s and was an adviser and consultant to the Beijing Music Festival. It was when IMG wanted to set up a Beijing office that he decided to go it alone and set up his own agency. \"I had a serious discussion with the head of IMG and decided I wouldn't work for him and that I would work for myself. They wanted me to operate here how the New York office thought and that just wasn't right for China,\" he says. Moving to China was a bold move for someone who was already in his late 50s but it has proved successful.,\"What was important was to have Chinese business partners who know how to deal with Chinese business people. In the first few years I had a lot to learn,\" he says. Bringing top orchestras to China can be a logistical nightmare, transporting artists and their instruments. \"The maestro always travels first class and the players in the top orchestras business class. This often means they have to travel over two days because there is not enough room for them all in the business class of a single airliner,\" he says. He believes Chinese orchestras are now bridging the talent gap between themselves and major Western orchestras as Japanese orchestras have succeeded in doing. \"Chinese orchestras are doing rather well now. For them to be the equivalent of the Berlin or Czech Philharmonic we are probably still looking at 20 years from now,\" he says. \"The actual playing talent is strong everywhere. The only difference to me is the interpretation and the traditions of interpretation.\" He says China suffers also from something of a brain drain of its musicians. \"Many Chinese youngsters go to the Curtis (Institute of Music in Philadelphia) or the Juilliard (School in New York) or the Royal Academy of Music in London and don't come back. There are top Chinese players in the Berlin and the New York philharmonic orchestras.\" Armstrong says he continues to be impressed by the range of the sheer number of music events across China. \"There is an incredible range of orchestras, chamber music, dance and also musicals being brought here right across China. It is very exciting to be part of it all.\" ", "overall-label": "life-style"}
{"content": "China will work to refine the legal support system of the Belt and Road to enable better settlement of disputes and foster a business environment governed by the rule of law, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Monday. A dispute settlement mechanism featuring lawsuits, arbitration and mediation will be established at an early date, Wang said at the opening of the Forum on Belt and Road Legal Cooperation in Beijing. A security network of treaties should be established to fit into the development of the Belt and Road, with efforts made to fill blank areas and update relevant treaties, he said. \"Regulations and the rule of law provide the green light for the Belt and Road to go global, as well as the safety valve to cope with different types of uncertain risks and challenges,\" he said. China has always respected international law as well as national laws in its cooperation with different nations. The country is expediting the signing of agreements in trade, investment, finance, taxation, intellectual property rights, transportation and environmental protection with different nations to develop a Belt and Road network of regulations and the rule of law, he said. An information sharing and big data service platform on legal issues involving the Belt and Road will be established to enable better legal consultation services. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is working on a national treaty database to improve access to the information, he said. Beijing has decided to fund a research and study program for Belt and Road legal cooperation to further exchanges and cooperation, Wang said. He said that five years since it was proposed by President Xi Jinping in 2013, the Belt and Road Initiative has seen very fruitful early outcomes. China has signed cooperative agreements with close to 90 countries and international organizations on jointly building the Belt and Road, Wang said. China's investment in the involved countries has exceeded $70 billion, with more than 200,000 jobs created, he added. \"There are only win-win or multiwin outcomes, rather than sole beneficiaries,\" he said. Liu Zhenmin, under-secretary-general for economic and social affairs at the United Nations, said the initiative could be an opportunity to further harmonize legal systems related to foreign investment treatment and dispute settlements, strengthening multilateral systems and boosting implementation of Article 33 of the UN Charter on the dispute settlement. Douglas Flint, the UK Treasury's Belt and Road envoy, said that clarity and legal certainty will be crucial components for Belt and Road projects to promote the flow of international capital. Belt and Road projects are becoming increasingly multinational, thus providing requirements for contract frameworks that are widely accepted, clear and flexible, he said.", "overall-label": "politics"}

The Ministry of Commerce announced on Wednesday that a US delegation led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, visiting as US President Donald Trump's special envoy, will exchange views on China-US economic and trade issues with Vice-Premier Liu He, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee. The US delegation also includes Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, Larry Kudlow, assistant to the president for economic policy, and Peter Navarro, assistant to the president for trade and manufacturing policy. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Wednesday it is in the best interests of the two countries to resolve disputes and maintain the overall stability of bilateral business relations through negotiations. Taking into account the size of the Chinese and US economies and the complexity of the relationship, it may not be realistic to expect one meeting to resolve all the problems, she said at a news briefing. Experts remain \"cautiously optimistic\" about the trade talks, even as the Trump administration already threatened to impose tariffs on up to $150 billion in Chinese imports while China has vowed to retaliate against US exports if Washington moves forward with that plan. Chen Wenling, chief economist at the China Center for International Economic Exchanges, said the topics under discussion surely will not be limited to trade, because the US also wants to promote its \"America First\" strategy by containing China's ability to attract foreign direct investment. \"The US also is deeply concerned about China's industrial upgrades, technology transfers, currency rate, talent flows and intellectual property protection. It also wants to relieve the downward pressure on its stock market,\" she said. \"China's firm stance has prompted Trump to send all his top economic officials for trade negotiations to avert further escalation or a trade war,\" said Xue Rongjiu, deputy director of Beijing-based China Society for WTO Studies. Zhang Monan, a researcher at the China Center for International Economic Exchanges, said the codependency of China and the US is a highly reactive relationship. \"When one country changes the terms of the engagement, the other, feeling scorned, usually responds in kind,\" Zhang said.", "overall-label": "business"}
{"content": "Beijing's top health authority will launch a mosquito-control campaign in mid-May to guard against the increasing risk of dengue fever, the Beijing Municipal Commission of Health and Family Planning said on Wednesday. During the campaign, which will run until August, health authorities will focus on cleaning public places to remove excessive water and prevent mosquitoes from breeding, Liu Zejun, a member of the commission in charge of disease control and prevention in the city, said at a news conference. Health authorities will mobilize the public to remove pools of water from places such as public restrooms, residential areas, parks, construction sites and garbage recycling stations, he said. Other steps to control mosquitoes include releasing mosquito-eating fish in lakes and ponds and applying pesticides in areas where removing water is difficult, such as underground sewage systems, he said. The Beijing Municipal Commission of Health and Family Planning has trained 16 professional mosquito elimination teams to help with the work, he said. Studies by disease control and prevention experts have found that the density of Aedes albopictus, a kind of mosquito that is the major medium for transmission of dengue fever, has been increasing in Beijing for several years, said Zeng Xiaopeng, deputy director of the Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control. In 2013, they accounted for 3.5 percent of all mosquitoes in Beijing, but the proportion rose to 14 percent last year. That means a higher risk of dengue fever, which can cause death in serious cases, he said. Dengue fever outbreaks have occurred in some areas of South China, but sporadic imported cases have been spotted in recent years in northern areas, including Beijing, due to the spread of the virus, Zeng said. Mosquitoes become more active with rising temperatures, and their density peaks in July and August in Beijing, he said. Health authorities are prepared for outbreaks of infectious diseases including dengue fever, and emergency plans are ready, he said.", "overall-label": "politics"}
{"content": "BEIJING - While bracing for the first China International Import Expo (CIIE), worldwide participants including officials and company leaders are actively edging the competitiveness of their exhibits or products. Among them, hopeful words like \"opportunities\", \"chance\",\"promising\" and \"great platform\" are most frequently mentioned when referring to the mega expo, which will be held in Shanghai on Nov 5-10. From the big beneficiaries of China's opening-up policy like European auto-industry giants to fresh comers such as African food and beverage suppliers, there is a common aspiration to make best of the expo to promote their brands and products, and take bigger shares in the lucrative market of China. \"We look forward to meeting companies we can collaborate with as we are always seeking to expand our ecosystem of partners,\" said German software corporation SAP in a statement. It told Xinhua that the CIIE provides a new platform for global businesses to collaborate and promotes common prosperity of the world economy and trade. Metro, a leading German international company in wholesale and food retail, said that it wants to take the opportunity of the CIIE to showcase its strength in imports and global sourcing. Philippe Palazzi, chief operating officer and management board member of Metro AG, said: \"We also want to use such a great platform to enhance our exchange and communication with local customers, business partners and other stakeholders as we are committed to the long-term development in China.\" For Danish brand Danisa, which sees itself as a \"beneficiary of China's opening-up to the world policy,\" the expo means more customers and partners. \"We believe that through this event we will have better exposure in China and find more partners to help us distribute our products to not only tier-1/tier-2 cities, but also further into tier-3/tier-4/tier-5 cities,\" said Erik Bresling, CEO of Danisa. Companies which are believers of China's development and beneficiaries of the opening-up policy make a big part of CIIE participants. Regional delegations also attach great importance to the platform, viewing it as a gateway and window to know better China's market and development path. So far, over 150,000 buyers from home and abroad are estimated to attend the expo. Apart from business exhibitions, 80 countries and three international organizations have confirmed their participation in the country-pavilion exhibition, which covers a total area of 30,000 square meters. Horacio Licon, vice president of the Greater Houston Partnership, an economic development organization serving the Greater Houston area, told Xinhua that the expo is a great opportunity for Houston to continue developing its trade relationship with China, the second largest trading partner of the region. Licon will lead a team of 15 delegates representing 12 companies to Shanghai in November, which cover diverse industries such as technology, manufacturing, energy and logistics. \"We have expectations in terms of understanding and hearing directly from our Chinese counterparts on the private sector and on the government side, the messages about the future of Chinese trade, how the government is seeing the future of Chinese trade and how Houston will play a role in that relationship,\" Licon said. The American delegate's concern is understandable as the US-initiated tariff frictions with major trade partners are threatening the hard-won international trade rules and prickling China-US economic ties. According to John Edwards, British consul-general in Shanghai, the CIIE is a great opportunity for newcomers to understand the Chinese market as well as the customers while on the other hand, it is also \"a very special symbol of China's opening-up.\" His comments echoed President Xi Jinping's remarks on the expo. \"Looking ahead, China will open still wider and its development will deliver even greater benefits to the rest of the world,\" Xi said in a speech at the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in Vietnam last year, adding that the CIIE \"will help all parties to better share the opportunities of China's development.\" \"The expo sends a strong message from China in favor of free trade and multilateralism,\" Argentine political observer Patricio Giusto, who is head of consulting firm Diagnostico Politico (Political Diagnosis), told Xinhua in a recent interview.

Participants should submit their entries before Aug 31, 2017, according to Zhou. Experts on chronic disease management, social work, rehabilitation and sports medicine will select 100 works through three rounds of evaluation, she said. According to the 2010 population census, 28.3 percent of the whole population of China was over 50 years old and the figure is set to surpass 50 percent by 2050. The demand for pension services is large in China due to the fast growth of a weaker, older population, such as the disabled and older people who live on their own, said an official from the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China.  Cheng Haijun, professor from Beijing College of Social Administration, said the government released a series of policies to target those problems, including the pilot projects concerning old age allowance, home-based care for the aged and a combination of medical treatment and endowment. Last year, 15 pilot regions were set up for long-term care, expecting to meet the demand of 40 million disabled or weak older people, he said.  According to the government report released this year, the future policies will focus on aspects including improving the quality of pension services, integrating the pension industry with tourism, culture, entertainment and fitness industries, and promoting the financing and investment in the pension industry, Cheng said.

{"content": "BEIJING - Have you ever thought about changing your job due to being squeezed for over 45 minutes in a metro carriage each day? Researchers used transit smartcards from travelers in Beijing retained over a seven-year period from 2011 to 2017 to track boarding and alighting metro stations associated with home and work location. They tracked who moved and who remained at their homes and workplace and provided a longitudinal study of job and housing dynamics with group conceptualization and characterization. With the seven-year transit smartcard dataset, researchers traced individual trajectories of residences and workplaces. Based on in-metro travel times before and after job and/or home moves, they found that 45 minutes is an inflection point where the behavioral preference changes. Commuters whose travel time exceeds the point prefer to shorten commutes by moving, while others with shorter commutes tend to increase travel time for better jobs and/or residences. Moreover, the researchers captured four mobility groups -- home mover, job hopper, job-and-residence switcher and stayer. Stayers with a high job and housing stability tend to be apartment owners subject to middle- to high-income groups. Home movers work at places similar to stayers, while they may upgrade from tenancy to ownership. Switchers increase commute time as well as housing expenditure via job and home moves, as they pay for better residences and work farther from home. Job hoppers mainly reside in the suburbs, suffer from long commutes, change jobs frequently and are likely to be low-income migrants. The research was jointly conducted by the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research of Chinese Academy of Sciences, the University of Sydney, the University of Hong Kong and Beijing Jiaotong University. Residential locations, the jobs-housing relationship and commuting patterns are key elements to understand the urban spatial structure and how city dwellers live. Their successive interaction is important for various fields including urban planning, transport, intraurban migration studies and social science. However, understanding of the long-term trajectories of the workplace and home location and the resulting commuting patterns is still limited due to the lack of year-to-year data tracking individual behavior.", "overall-label": "tech"}

The training sessions will include courses on traditional culture and crafts. All courses will be given online and via mobile applications. All teachers must complete the 40-hour training sessions by 2020. To better educate children, the teachers must be better educated first. Also, a teacher must have deep affection for traditional culture, said Li Yi, the commission's deputy director. The courses are all online so the teachers can be flexible. The commission will monitor teachers' progress in completing the training sessions and see if they've done their homework, Li said. It also will analyze which sessions receive more hits so the content can be better adjusted in the future.

It is expected to reach 1.5 trillion yuan by 2020. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology anticipates more than 1.7 billion public machine-to-machine connections will be enabled by 2020. By then, China is expected to account for 59 percent of the connected device market in the Asia-Pacific region, excluding Japan. Starta said manufacturing spend on the IoT will account for a major portion of the overall IoT spend. Key investment areas include asset tracking, connected field devices and condition-based maintenance, and autonomous robots. Market research firm IDC predicted that Chinese manufacturing IoT spending will grow by 15 percent annually to reach $127.5 billion by 2020. \"The rapid growth in adoption of the IoT will largely be fueled by Chinese government policies. While it is the manufacturing powerhouse of the world, China is challenged by slowing economic growth, increasing labor costs, and higher consumer expectations,\" said Starta. \"The Chinese government recognizes the key role of the IoT in manufacturing industries' efforts to modernize and remain competitive, and has therefore incorporated the IoT in its 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-20). Adoption of the IoT is key to the government's 'Made in China 2025' and 'Internet Plus' strategies,\" he said. The IoT 13th Five-Year Plan, published by the MIIT, provides clear guidelines and goals for development through 2020. These include developing and strengthening capabilities around telecom, cloud computing, the IoT, and big data, and reducing reliance on foreign technology and imports. Rather than waiting for government policy to stimulate the market, domestic companies China Aerospace Science and Industry Corp, Sany Heavy Industry Co and Haier Group have all pushed their own industrial cloud platforms to grab as much market share as possible. \"Financial support such as special funds are available for key development projects, and numerous pilot programs are also underway across the country, including the IoT industrial development clusters in the Bohai Sea Rim, the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta regions,\" said Sun Fuquan, a researcher at the Beijing-based Chinese Academy of Science and Technology for Development. He said the country also needs to ensure that the current investment in technologies, including the internet, robotics and virtual reality, will be leveraged to the benefit of its industries.", "overall-label": "business"}
{"content": "  Beijing and Moscoware in close communication on Russia's road map for settling the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said on Wednesday.  Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Morgulov said Russia has drafted, and is ready to discuss with its partners, a road map on denuclearization and overall peace on the Korean Peninsula that includes a phased plan to bring the parties toward dialogue without preconditions, Russia's Sputnik News Agency and Radio reported on Tuesday.  Morgulov said Russia supports China's proposals to solve the issue and opposes unilateral sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea that aim to put an \"economic chokehold\" on Pyongyang.  \"China welcomes and is open-minded about any constructive efforts that will help to push forward the denuclearization of the peninsula and maintain peace and stability in the region,\" Lu said at a daily news conference in Beijing.  China and Russia are \"in close communication\" through their comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination, and the two sides are \"coordinating on international and regional issues\", Lu said.  China has a \"dual track\" approach to denuclearizing the peninsula and ensuring peace. It includes a suspension of Pyongyang's nuclear and missile activities, as well as a cessation of large-scale military drills by the United States and the Republic of Korea.  \"The proposals - which aim to solve the most urgent concerns of all parties and find a breakthrough for resuming talks - have won increasing understanding and support from other countries,\" Lu said. \"They also coincide with Russia's proposal, and the two sides are currently staying in close communication on the road map for settlement of the peninsula nuclear issue.\"  Lu added that the US and DPRK are direct parties to the issue and hold the keys to solving it.  \"China would be glad to see the two sides improve ties through direct talks and create conditions for settlement,\" he said.  Li Yonghui, a senior researcher of Russian foreign policy at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that the peninsula nuclear issue has affected the security and stability of Northeast Asia and that denuclearization serves the common interests of China and Russia.  \"The two countries' coordination and cooperation on this issue will help to solve the crisis and maintain regional peace and stability, as well as set up a new security mechanism in Northeast Asia,\" she said.

{"content": "Courts nationwide prosecuted 77 kindergarten employees on charges of child abuse between January and November, with another 69 arrested and awaiting trial, the top prosecuting authority said on Thursday. While the numbers are not large, an expert has said they show that authorities are paying greater attention to child protection, including against sexual predators. Shi Weizhong, deputy director of juvenile prosecution for the Supreme People's Procuratorate, said local authorities are testing several methods to stop convicted sex offenders from working with minors, such as at preschools. \"Some local procuratorates have made commendable attempts and achieved good results,\" he said at a news conference on Thursday. He cited two examples: Shanghai, which has a database of sex offenders that allows employers to run background checks on potential hires; and Shandong province, which has a platform for police officers to alert specialist prosecutors of potential child abuse cases early, to make investigations faster and more efficient. The SPP sees local procuratorates as \"laboratories for prosecuting crimes against juveniles\", Shi said, adding that other regions will be encouraged to replicate successful practices. A series of high-profile scandals have thrown a spotlight onto child protection, drawing more attention from the public and authorities. The SPP issued a circular on abuse at kindergartens on Dec 1, which resulted in prosecutors stepping up assistance for police in investigations as well as educating the managers of preschools on how to keep their students safe. \"People used to regard physical punishment as a way for teachers to discipline their students, but the number of arrests and prosecutions this year show both the public and prosecutors are realizing it is a problem,\" said Song Yinghui, a law professor at Beijing Normal University. On Nov 13, Shanghai police detained a suspect surnamed Zheng who ran a day care center where staff members were filmed hitting toddlers. Three employees were also detained. Around the same time, Beijing police detained teachers over alleged child abuse at a kindergarten operated by Golden Cradle Education. The company has more than 700 kindergartens and schools nationwide. The Beijing Education Commission conducted a citywide safety inspection of kindergartens last month, with the results listed in a database. Those with potential risks or problems were told to make immediate improvements. Zheng Xinjian, director of juvenile prosecution for the SPP, said in addition to the work by local procuratorates, legislators should also look to strengthen the laws on child protection. \"Though existing laws have clauses to protect children, they are scattered in different laws and it's not systematic. That causes problems,\" he said.   ", "overall-label": "politics"}
{"content": "  Chinese companies are scrambling to gain a lead in the race to commercialize 5G\u00a3\u00ador the next-generation mobile communication technology\u00a3\u00adas the country evolves from being a follower into a pioneering player in the global telecoms arena. The super-fast 5G network is expected to allow consumers to download an 8-gigabit movie in seconds and help to make autonomous driving a reality, causing ripples across most industries and sectors in a new internet revolution. The mobile technology is so important that it was highlighted in the government work report delivered by Premier Li Keqiang during this year's National People's Congress session in March. A report by the China Academy of Information and Communication Technology predicted that 5G will drive 6.3 trillion yuan ($946.8 billion) of economic output in the country by 2030. China Mobile Communications Corp, the world's largest telecoms carrier by subscribers, said it aims to deploy more than 10,000 5G base stations by 2020 and aims to launch a pre-commercial 5G service in 2018. Last November, the Beijing-based company outgunned foreign rivals to lead the global 5G System Architecture project, which it said will determine the \"structure of 5G networks\". It came shortly after polar coding, a technology backed by Chinese telecoms equipment maker Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, was approved as part of the global standards for 5G.   \"The progress highlights the rising influence of Chinese companies in the global telecommunications arena,\" said Xiang Ligang, CEO of telecoms industry website Cctime. \"It is a recognition of both their technological prowess and their brand influence.\" Currently, 5G standards are still under development by 3GPP, or the 3rd Generation Partnership Project, which promotes global wireless communications standards. But the body announced it will accelerate the process and lock down the first version of global 5G standards around June in 2018\u00a3\u00adsignaling that little change would be expected to current technical specifications and vendors can get to work on standardized 5G equipment, experts said. To pounce on the opportunities, China is rushing to finish its own series of 5G trials. The country's telecoms authority said in November that the country has started the third phase of 5G technical tests, as it aims to get pre-commercial 5G products ready as soon as possible. Wen Ku, director of the telecoms development department at the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, said developments will be ramped up. Wen said more efforts will be made to accelerate tests on network planning, systems, chips and other products in the industrial chain, which will help to lay down a sound foundation for the fast development of a 5G network in China. The country has already established the world's largest 5G test field in Huairou district, Beijing, where about 30 telecom base stations were built and China Mobile, Huawei, ZTE Corp and a string of foreign tech companies have finished China's second phase of 5G research and development tests.   To accelerate the path to 5G, MIIT also detailed frequency bands\u00a3\u00adboth low, medium and high frequencies are involved\u00a3\u00adfor the development of the super-fast networks in China. \"A frequency band is as important to telecoms carriers as land is in the real estate industry,\" said Fu Liang, an independent telecom analyst. \"Specifying the designated frequency band for 5G tests will motivate enterprises to channel resources to that band, thus promoting faster development.\" Companies are also building up massive financial resources to exploit the opportunities that will come. US investment bank Jefferies said China's mobile carriers will invest at least $173 billion in 5G construction from 2019-25, an increase of 48 percent on the total spend on 4G from 2013-20. \"5G will no longer be a simple technology or system,\" said Huang Yuhong, deputy head of the China Mobile Research Institute. \"Instead, it is a platform in which the telecoms industry needs to be deeply linked with other sectors. That is a fundamental difference between 5G and 4G.\"", "overall-label": "tech"}
{"content": "Colin Maki, an American violin dealer, is trying to develop a market for old rare violins in China. Four rare violins were brought from New York to Beijing in August. And before a music event at the Yale Beijing Center, attendees were able to have a close look at the instruments and take pictures. They were placed on a small table, without any special protection. Maki, founder of an independent instrument consulting firm in New York, brought the violins to the event. He spoke to the audience while keeping a close eye on the violins. \"I have to be very careful about their safety. Each of them has been covered by insurance. Very high insurance,\" he says. \"So, I do not often display them in public like this.\" Li Yuhe, a violin teacher at the Conservatory of China, played the first sheet of Violin Concerto in E Minor by Felix Mendelssohn on each of the instruments. \"Each of them has a rather different tone, and they are all magnificent,\" she says. \"But the Strad is my favorite.\" \"Actually, I am here for the Strad,\" she says. The Stradivarius, or Strad, she played is one among only around 500 Strad violins left in the world, each of which is worth millions of dollars. A mere mention of the Stradivari is enough to create a buzz among musicians.  The Stradivari family is one of the most prominent violin makers in history. No one knows the secrets of how the Strads were made.  Violins made by the Stradivari family during the 17th to 18th centuries, which is now considered the golden age of violin-making, cannot be reproduced. Lighter than modern violins, and exquisitely crafted, a Strad violin is almost every violinist's dream. But few are able to afford one. For the past 20 years, Strad violins have increased in value at an average annual rate of around 14 percent, according to data from Rare Violins of New York. \"The value of Strad violins has never gone down,\" says Maki.  \"You can just hold it for years and see its price soar.\" He adds that a famous trader once said that maybe 100 years ago most fiddles were in the United Kingdom, but 20 to 30 years ago there were probably more Strad violins within the 30-mile radius of Chicago than in the entire United Kingdom. But now they are moving China. In 2015, the 1727 \"General Dupont\" Stradivarius violin was sold to a Chinese collector, a first. And Maki says that having visited China several times, he feels it is the time to step into the market. Data from Art Basel and UBS Global Art Market Report released earlier this year shows that China has the largest share of the market in global sales of art and antiques at open auctions. Zhang Maolun, an amateur violinist and a collector, says: \"Everyone knows that China is an untapped market. We have more wealthy people now.\" \"But it is hard to reap profits here as the market here currently is barren.\" This is because unlike Chinese paintings or chinaware, violins remain new and unfamiliar territory. Preservation and fixing violins \u00a1\u00aa old violins need to go to violin doctors on a regular basis \u00a1\u00aa can be quite a headache for Chinese investors. \"So the business prospects remain bleak,\" says Zhang. The day Maki arrived in Shenzhen, his first stop in China, he was contacted by a wealthy collector in Beijing. That gave Maki some confidence. \"We need to develop the culture first and do a lot of education \u00a1\u00aa from its investment value to how to keep the violins in good condition.\" With nearly 15 years of experience of selling instruments in different parts of the world, he says it worth a try. \"I know it takes time,\" he says. \"I don't sell a Strad every day.\"", "overall-label": "life-style"}
{"content": "Graduates from two top universities in Beijing will be granted fast-track Shanghai household registration authorization if they choose to work in the financial hub, according to a new policy issued by the city's education commission. Under a pilot program, those with bachelor's degrees from Peking University or Tsinghua University who have been offered jobs in Shanghai will be granted preferential treatment in their applications for Shanghai household registration permits, or hukou, which afford holders a full range of benefits including pensions, healthcare and child education stipends as well as auto and apartment purchasing quotas. The policy comes at a time when a long list of Chinese cities \u00a1\u00aa including Beijing, Tianjin and Shenzhen \u00a1\u00aa have offered to provide various incentives to attract talent, including hukou privileges. \"Shanghai's new policy ... significantly cuts the time required to obtain a Shanghai hukou under a points-based system,\" said Lu Yujie, managing consultant of human resources company Cornerstone Global Partners. First-tier cities like Shanghai and Beijing are feeling the pressure as second- and third-tier ones are attracting top graduates with preferential policies, but Shanghai, over the long term, needs to address its high living costs and property prices if it wants to attract and retain more talent, Lu said. With a population of nearly 25 million, Shanghai first started using a points-based hukou system for nonlocal graduates in 2004, with preference given to those with higher degrees and grade-point averages, as well as graduates with specialized skills in technology and other areas. With the updated policy, graduates from Peking and Tsinghua universities are exempted from the tedious points-generating process for hukou registrations, and only need to meet \"basic requirements\" if they are offered full-time jobs in Shanghai. Some students in Beijing from the two institutions said the policy is still not enough to attract them to work in Shanghai. Xu Haozhe, a postgraduate student at Peking University's law school, said, \"All my friends and potential business partners are in Beijing, and I have to make new friends if I go to Shanghai.\" Huang Yunwen, a junior student majoring in computer science at Peking University, said in the IT sector, Beijing offers more opportunities and choices. \"But that does not mean Shanghai is losing its appeal.

{"content": "  President Xi Jinping urged the country to develop into a strong sporting nation through the opportunities presented by hosting major events, before opening the 13th Chinese National Games in Tianjin on Sunday. Xi made the remark at a commendation conference to honor outstanding figures in the country's sports sector before he declared the opening of the quadrennial National Games. Sport carries the dreams of prosperity and rejuvenation of the Chinese nation as it represents a country's prowess and fortune, so China should quickly build itself into a world sporting power through dedicated planning and sound implementation, Xi said. As Beijing prepares to host the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games, Xi urged the country to take advantage of the high-profile occasion to promote balanced development of competitive sports, mass sports and the sports industry to enhance the athletic prowess and improve nation\u00a1\u00afs overall fitness, Xi said. Xi stressed that the country's sports development should address the public's growing demand for greater sports participation and higher fitness levels. The reform of including amateurs in the National Games program is a positive step, he added. The Tianjin games opened 19 events to amateur participation, a first in the games' 58-year history. Earlier on Sunday, Xi met with International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach and Sheikh Ahmad al-Fahad al-Sabah, president of the Olympic Council of Asia, who both attended the opening ceremony. During his meeting with Bach, Xi said preparations for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics are going smoothly.,  \"We will fully honor our commitments that we made during the bid process and deliver a fantastic, extraordinary and excellent Winter Games,\" he said. China will continue to support the IOC and cooperate with the IOC on issues including the Olympic Movement, sports' role in promoting world peace and development as well as the development of sports in China, he added.

{"content": "BEIJING - Optimism over a broad-based global recovery is gaining momentum in Davos, Switzerland, where policymakers and economists around the world have gathered to discuss a \"shared future\" at the ongoing World Economic Forum. Any topics on growth inevitably lead to discussions on China, which is playing an increasingly important role in setting the world's economic agenda as a major contributor to the global recovery. At Davos, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) raised its global growth forecast for 2018 and 2019 by 0.2 percentage points to 3.9 percent in its latest World Economic Outlook report, citing increased global growth momentum. China is expected to record growth pace of 6.6 percent in 2018, higher than the previous estimate, according to the IMF. World Bank data showed that China contributed 34 percent to world economic growth from 2012 to 2016, more than the contribution by the United States, European Union and Japan combined, according to Wang Jun, an official with the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). \"China remains the 'ballast stone and booster' of world economic recovery,\" Wang said. China's economy expanded 6.9 percent last year, picking up for the first time in seven years and well above the government annual target of around 6.5 percent. It's not only the better-than-expected growth number itself that fuelled optimism over the global recovery. China maintained medium-high growth with the help of booming domestic consumption, robust trade, and new technologies, which boosted external demand and international labor productivity, analysts said. \"The Chinese success story is deeply intertwined with the fortunes of the world economy,\" said David Lipton, IMF first deputy managing director, at a recent forum in Hong Kong. The world's most populous nation has always been a key market for international companies, but the country's shift toward a consumption-driven economy has made the market even more important. The contribution of consumption to economic growth reached 58.8 percent, up from 51.8 percent for 2012. At the same time, the Chinese increasingly crave products and services of better quality, creating opportunities for international brands. \"The rising purchasing power of China's middle class and their increasing tendency to accept new brands - domestic or international - will reshape the country's consumption market and inject new vitality to growth,\" said Lu Feng, director of China Macroeconomic Research Center with Peking University. The global recovery in 2017 was also helped by a rebound in trade. Despite rising anti-globalization sentiment, China has been an active promoter of foreign trade, with its total goods trade volume accounting for 8.8 percent of the world in the first 11 months of 2017, according to World Bank data. Trade volume reversed the downward trend seen in the previous two years and contributed about 9 percent to China's GDP expansion in 2017, NBS data showed. \"As a trading nation, China is a key partner for over 100 countries: countries that represent 80 percent of global GDP. It is the hub of global supply chains, a magnet for commodity exporters, and a source of final demand,\" Lipton said. While consumption or trade activities may still be prone to macroeconomic uncertainties, China is creating new growth drivers that will lead to stable, long-term growth. NBS data showed that new-energy vehicles, industrial robots, solar power and integrated circuit outshone most other industries in terms of output in 2017, contributing to a pick-up in industrial output growth in 2017. China plays a leading role in the development of fintech, robotics and artificial intelligence, and is a \"pacesetter\" for digital commerce, outweighing other countries in terms of online retailing and payments, Lipton said. With the sun shining on the global economy, it's time to \"fix the roof,\" according to IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde. \"To maintain a sustainable engine for global growth, China needs to tackle key challenge such as credit risks,\" Lipton said. \"China has a window of opportunity to accelerate economic reforms that can secure sustainable and inclusive growth.\"", "overall-label": "business"}

Pilot healthy cafeterias have been established in 59 schools. The program will be rolled out to all schools within this year.  Under a city regulation, boarding schools must \"strictly control food high in fat, salt and sugar, including burgers and instant noodles, and must ban unhealthy beverages such as soda\".  Schools should offer food safety and nutrition education classes each semester, as well as provide students' health information to parents on a regular basis, the regulation said.  Each school cafeteria should have one full-time or part-time nutritionist to make suggestions for the menu. And a weekly menu should be posted in notable places, along with nutritional information.

The new Page One bookstore is an example of the street's trendy modern flair. Just a few steps from the archway and the tram rails is the newly opened Page One bookstore. It brings an air of culture to the old commercial street. The peaceful atmosphere inside also provides an ideal space for travelers to take a rest while also enriching their minds.,Designed by the same architect as the so-called world's loneliest library in Beidaihe, this Page One branch is as much an architectural attraction as a bookstore. The white building is reminiscent of a traditional Beijing courtyard, while the \"black tower\" changes \"theme\" every month. This month's theme is children's books. Page One previously specialized in art design books and English titles. Now it has expanded into all categories. Literature, history, science, art, lifestyle, bestsellers, children... there's something for everyone. Christian Parreno from Ecuador came across the bookshop by chance. \"The interior architecture of the place is beautiful. I'm looking for some Chinese literature translated into English,\" he said. Visitor Liu Sha says, \"I liked to hang out in Qianmen when I was a kid. It's such a good thing that there is a bookstore here.\" Student Song Yuxin also said, \"Although online bookstores are so vibrant, I still like the atmosphere of a bookstore, and the feel of leafing through the pages.\" It seems no modern bookstore can do without its own cafe. The hope is people drawn in by the aroma will end up buying a book. Page One's cafe is on the third floor. Here, the best company for a cup of coffee would be a paper book. The store's windows act as frames for the scenery outside, which is full of traditional residential houses. You take in different views of the city while you roam through the store. Meanwhile, a plant zone brings some nature inside the building. In the future, the plants will also be for sale, providing another source of income for the bookshop. Many modern bookstores now let people read without having to buy. People can sit as long as they want, even all night.,But is a 24-hour bookstore necessary? Is it only for night owls to hang out and buy books? At 10:30 pm, there are still people in the store, even though only the first floor is open this late. Surprisingly, almost all the people I spoke to support the idea of a 24-hour bookstore. Visitor Lian Huabei says, \"I think it's absolutely necessary. There are 24-hour eateries, 24-hour bars, why not bookstores? I always sleep during the day and am awake at night. I'm the kind of person whose brain is more active during the night than daytime. Many writers or artists are nocturnal. A 24-hour bookstore might have no people. But you have to have one.\" Visitor Li Kunduo says, \"I would come here after work. Read something to improve myself.\" Graduate student Nier and her friend also think a city needs a 24-hour bookstore. \"This is very attractive to me. If I hang out late with friends, I would like to have a quiet place like this to stay for a while other than McDonalds.\"", "overall-label": "education"}
{"content": "African experts are confident that the China International Import Expo in Shanghai will deepen international business cooperation and address the trade imbalance between China and its trade partners. Cavince Adhere, a scholar specializing in China-Africa relations, said the expo thrusts China toward a new frontier for goods and services around the world. However, while the expo has been deemed a significant move by China to embrace foreign products and services, Adhere said the big question in many African capitals is how the continent will make the best use of the opportunity. The low volume of African exports to China has been a concern for a long time, and the depth and complexity of China's economy make it difficult for many African countries to compete, he said, resulting in African countries exporting more raw products to Beijing and importing high value-added products in return. \"The expo is therefore a good opportunity for China and Africa to explore what is working and how best to harness the existing potential toward win-win trade relations,\" he said, adding that data from various sources indicate that African exports to China have been on an upward trend. For successful results, Adhere said, both parties need progressive economic partnerships that can facilitate African exports to the Chinese market. He said there is need to diversify the type of African products that China welcomes into its markets\u00a3\u00adfrom traditional crude oil, copper, iron and rare minerals to products like flowers, vegetables and beverages. \"Africa should also aggressively market new sources of comparative advantage, such as tourism to the Chinese market. The continent should also leverage the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation to further buoy its exports to China,\" Adhere said. Enock Twinoburyo, an economist based in Rwanda's capital, Kigali, said that China's opening of its market is a starting gesture in a world where international trade is on a downward trend. \"In the regime of the emerging trade wars, the China import expo may be an avenue to bring order to international trade. The need for nonprohibitive regimes remains warranted,\" he said. Twinoburyo believes that China has always had a generous import regime for African countries, and an open market policy could be an effective way to restore the trade balance between Africa and the world, as well as with China in the long term. He said that over the long term, Africa's share of international trade has remained between 2 and 3 percent and that the continent's competitiveness needs to be supported by structural transformations, from production of raw products to added value. Richard Lebero, a trade and investment policy expert based in Kigali, said that as he looks at the Chinese expo from an African perspective, he sees China reemphasizing its open trade policy for all countries.", "overall-label": "business"}
{"content": "Beijing residents are preparing for trips to cities in southern China to escape the worsening smog and chilly weather, online travel agency Qunar said on Wednesday. The company said searches for flights from the capital to the southern provinces of Hainan and Yunnan had risen rapidly since Tuesday. In particular, searches for flights to Lijiang in Yunnan had increased by 50 percent compared with the last month. Flights from Beijing to Hainan's Sanya have been the second-most popular search topic on the Qunar platform for two consecutive days, behind only to flights from the capital to Shanghai. The data is based on 150 million registered users. Ctrip, another online travel agency, said searches using the words \"escape the smog and cold weather\" have risen by over 300 percent on its platform since Tuesday. Sanya, Lijiang and Xiamen in Fujian province were the top three destinations for Beijing travelers. The company said outbound destinations such as Thailand have also become popular due to preferential visa policies for Chinese travelers. \"Over 100 travelers booked packages to Phuket island in Thailand yesterday, with 70 percent of the packages booked from Beijing,\" a Ctrip representative said on Wednesday.", "overall-label": "life-style"}
{"content": "Han Lu, 45, a businessman in the auto industry who travels frequently, is looking forward to Beijing Daxing International Airport opening\u00a3\u00adwhich is scheduled for Sept 30\u00a3\u00adbecause he lives in the south of the city. \"I usually spend more than one and a half hours getting to Beijing Capital International Airport from home. Hopefully, the new airport will save me an hour on the road,\" he said. On the other hand, Wang Liu, 36, a marketing director whose company has headquarters in Shanghai, is worried that it may take her much longer to get to the new airport from her home in the northwest of Beijing. \"I fly to Shanghai four times a month on average, sometimes even more. China Eastern Airlines, whose flights I take most of the time, will move to the new airport, which probably means I will have to spend much more time getting there,\" she said. \"It will be a problem for me.\" Beijing Daxing International Airport, an 80 billion yuan ($11.6 billion) project, will affect or even change people's lives, including those of travelers from all over the world, Beijing residents, airline employees and people living in nearby areas such as Tianjin and Hebei province. The airport, which will be the largest in the world when completed, will contribute to the global air transportation network and economic growth in Beijing's southern districts as well as nearby regions. It will also produce business opportunities for both domestic and foreign airlines, according to a government official and industry experts. Cui Xiaohao, deputy head of the Beijing Commission of Development and Reform and deputy director of the new airport's office, said the facility is the key project for Beijing this year and will enable the capital to serve as the country's international communications, cultural, political and scientific innovation center. \"More than 100 million passengers used Beijing Capital International Airport last year, which is close to its capacity,\" Cui said. \"The new airport will ease pressure on the existing one, giving it a chance to improve its facilities and service.\" The Civil Aviation Administration of China predicts that the number of passengers using Beijing's airports annually will reach 150 million by 2025. The new airport is designed to handle 45 million passengers annually by 2021 and 72 million by 2025. There are long-term plans to expand the number to 100 million, according to CAAC. Cui said: \"That will further improve Beijing's role as the international communications center of China by creating better airport conditions and airline services. The new airport will help balance Beijing's economic growth between the northern and southern areas of the city.\" The northern areas have long been considered to be more developed than those in the south. There are more universities, high-tech companies and research institutions in northern Beijing, while southern districts are home to clothing wholesale outlets, buildings material markets, factories and farmland. Daxing district was selected as the site for the new airport to help accelerate the industrial transformation of the area, Cui said. \"The new airport will bring talent, related businesses and services to southern areas, which will boost the local economy,\" he added. Li Lei, a principal with the Roland Berger consultancy in Shanghai, said the new airport will help drive the coordinated development of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei. It also has advantages in meeting the demands of the Xiongan New Area, whose main function is to serve as a development hub for these three regions. The new airport, which is expected to become North China's air travel hub, is situated on the border of Beijing and Langfang, Hebei. It is 46 kilometers from Tian'anmen Square, 26 km from downtown Langfang, 55 km from the Xiongan New Area and 67 km from Beijing Capital International Airport. Given the strong regional transportation network between Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei, travelers landing at the new airport will be able to reach downtown Beijing, the city's government sub-center in Tongzhou district and the Xiongan New Area within half an hour. They can also reach nearby cities including Shijiazhuang, Tangshan and Baoding in Hebei, along with Tianjin, within an hour of landing, according to the new airport's office. Li said, \"The new airport is farther from the downtown area than Beijing Capital International Airport, and there will be some disadvantages for it to attract business travelers in the initial stages of operations. \"However, a number of State-owned enterprises in Beijing plan to move to the Xiongan New Area, and the new airport is predicted to attract more travelers who take business trips from this area to other regions.\" Completion of the new project will bring business opportunities to the two major Beijing airports and airlines\u00a3\u00adincluding those staying at the existing airport and those moving to the new one. \"Cooperation between the two airports is greater than their competition, and they will complement each other,\" Li said. On Jan 3, CAAC said the new airport is designed as a large international aviation hub, the new growth driver for the nation's development and a comprehensive transportation hub for the integrated development of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei. Meanwhile, Beijing Capital International Airport will take on the role of an international aviation hub for the Asia-Pacific region. Cui, the deputy director, said, \"Different from the two airports in Shanghai, where one is mainly for domestic airlines and the other mostly for international carriers, the two in Beijing will both be international.\" He said this arrangement, added with the airports in Tianjin and Shijiazhuang, capital of Hebei, will form a world-class airport complex in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei cluster. Tianjin airport will become the international airfreight center for North China and a regional hub, while the one in Shijiazhuang will be developed into a hub for budget airlines and an air courier center. CAAC also announced plans for the relocation of airlines. Carriers including China Southern, China Eastern, Beijing Capital Airlines and China United Airlines will move to the new facility, while others such as Air China, Hainan Airlines and Grand China Air will remain at Beijing Capital International Airport. Foreign airlines, along with those from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, can choose which airport they operate from, with the option of having a presence at both. Chinese carriers, except China Postal Airlines, will have to use just one airport. The phased transition will start from next winter and be completed over 12 months, CAAC said. Li, at Roland Berger, said, \"In the initial period of operation, the revenue of airlines that move to the new airport may be affected. Take China Eastern, for example\u00a3\u00adits most profitable flights are those operating between Beijing and Shanghai, and the carrier may lose some business travelers after the move. \"However, with the improvement in services and better infrastructure at the new airport, such losses will gradually be recovered. The new airport can also attract more passengers by introducing better shopping experiences and smart devices.\" Huang Pu, general manager of China Eastern's planning and coordination division in Beijing, sees the move to the new airport as a great opportunity for the company to make the capital its most important market outside of its Shanghai headquarters. \"We have detailed plans to expand our network and invest in the support project at the new airport,\" he said. As a foreign airline with the right to choose its operating location in Beijing, Air France KLM plans to move to the new airport. Toon Balm, general manager of Air France KLM China, said many people fly from Europe to Beijing, but they do not stop in the city, and continue their journeys on flights operated by the carrier's Chinese partners. \"China Eastern, China Southern and many other airlines in the Sky-Team Airline Alliance will move to the new airport, so we will follow,\" he said. Balm said Air France KLM hopes the new airport will bring additional traffic, and from a commercial perspective that business can grow. He added that the carrier needs to be very flexible with its aircraft, network, slots and customers. He said moving to the new airport is a challenge, but from a business perspective it is very interesting. American Airlines, the largest carrier by fleet size, said it is considering opportunities for increased connectivity with China Southern, including moving with the carrier to the new airport. However, a final decision has not been made. In 2017, American Airlines made a $200 million equity investment in China Southern, creating a foundation for their long-term partnership. Code sharing and interline agreements between the two carriers give customers of both access to many more destinations in China, as well as North and South America, the US airline said. Anthony Flynn, communications manager for Asia-Pacific at American Airlines, said: \"In November, American Airlines and China Southern took steps to further strengthen our partnership with a significant expansion of code-sharing cooperation and the launch of reciprocal frequent flyer benefits and lounge access. These benefits are due to come online this year. \"China and the United States are the two biggest air travel markets in the world, with growth forecast in the business and leisure sectors. With the opening of Beijing Daxing International Airport in 2019 and the ability to cooperate fully with China Southern, American Airlines is excited about its future in the Chinese market.\" According to the office at the new airport, 80 percent of the interior construction has been completed and all the external work is finished. The water supply pipeline network and electricity transformer substations are ready, while a natural gas pipeline will soon be in use. Green and energy-saving concepts were adopted for the airport's design and construction. Passengers will spend a maximum of eight minutes getting from the center of the terminal to the farthest boarding gate, about one-third the time spent at Beijing Capital International Airport, according to the office. Renewable energy will comprise more than 10 percent of the new airport's energy consumption mix when construction is completed. This will rank it No 1 in terms of the renewable energy adoption level at airports nationwide, according to the Beijing Municipal Commission of Development and Reform. Photovoltaic solar energy panels have been fitted on roofs of the parking lots and business jets hangar, while geothermal energy will be used in the airport's service facilities. The solar energy generation system will provide 6.1 million kilowatt-hours annually for the new facility, accounting for 1 percent of total energy consumption. Traditional power plants and natural gas will also supply energy to the site. A comprehensive network will help travelers reach Beijing districts or nearby cities, and it is forecast that more than 50 percent of them will use public transportation at the new airport.", "overall-label": "politics"}
{"content": "  It wasn't long after I first set foot in China that I was introduced to the ephemeral delights of Beijing's hutong, circa 2016.  Having had no previous experience of these age-old alleyways, I knew not what to expect. Would they be like the \"snickelways\" of York, England, which I had explored in my youth, or something more akin to the winding passageways of Manama's old souk, in my former home of Bahrain?  Turns out it was neither. They were unique and I was enchanted - not only by the architecture, but also by the vibrancy of the assorted bars, restaurants, galleries and boutiques that called these lawless lanes their home.  And lawless they were, or so I was to learn later, when a program of renovations and crackdowns on illegal structures began in earnest this year.      But I didn't know that at the time. Coming to the city with fresh eyes, and only some small knowledge of its history, I simply assumed this was the way the hutong had always been.  Well, maybe not always-I had supposed those establishments owned or run by foreigners were newer additions. The nature of the business being conducted must surely have changed over time, too. But nothing that my naive gaze fell upon lead me to believe that this part of the city's heart had, at least in recent memory, been anything but the diverse mishmash of culture and merriment that was laid out before me.  I realize now I did myself a disservice in those early days in this ancient city by not exploring more of what the hutong had to offer and better patronizing those places I had found and begun to love.  For it turned out that a profound change was on the horizon, one that - if the city's English-language lifestyle magazines are to be believed - was met with no small amount of shock and sorrow, especially among the expatriate community.  I, too, felt a kind of despondency, as I watched many of my favorite new haunts torn down or bricked up. Some were shuttered, others relocated, and a few have managed to carry on, for now.  Change, of course, is inevitable. Like living entities, all cities change. No big city is immune to it, and Beijing is bigger than most.  What makes this change different, though, is that it isn't really a change at all. It's more of a reversion. As an unnamed official was quoted as saying in May, the renovations are meant to \"recover the original appearance of the hutong\", described as \"an integral part of the capital's traditional culture\".  As a foreigner in a foreign land, I feel I'm in no position to pass comment. I can merely bear witness to the renovations' effects.  And though I was saddened by their passing, I'm just glad I experienced the magic of those haphazard hutong hangouts, before they were lost to time.

{"content": "  The physician, who trained at the prestigious Peking Union College Hospital, has 15 years experience of working on the wards, and is highly regarded. In fact, the specialist in uterine fibroids once discovered that scalpers sold appointments for consultations with him for 3,000 yuan ($444), 400 times the official price.  \"I should be proud,\" said the 45-year-old gynecologist.  However, in the winter of 2011, he was told a patient had waited overnight in temperatures of - 4 C to obtain a ticket for a consultation.  \"I was shocked,\" Gong recalled. \"How could patients suffer like that just to see a doctor?\"  China's medical resources are extremely unbalanced: 80 percent of patients live in rural areas, but the best hospitals are concentrated in big cities, such as Beijing and Shanghai. Last year, an estimated 7 million patients from Hebei province alone visited hospitals in neighboring Beijing.  Gong admires his counterparts in the United States, whose patients have no difficulty accessing treatment. After visiting a clinic in Cleveland, Ohio, he said seeking treatment there was \"almost enjoyable\".  In 2013, Gong quit the public hospital system, where he worked as a contract doctor in hospitals in Shanghai and Shenzhen, Guangdong province. Last year, he went freelance and set up China's first gynecologist group, attracting more than 100 specialists as members.    At school, Gong was shy and unsociable, but he was the top scorer in the national college entrance examination in his hometown in Zhejiang province. He followed his father's advice to study clinical medicine at university.  He began his career as a general practitioner, but was frustrated at dealing with so many patients with terminal illnesses. In response, he became a surgeon before moving into gynecology.  Gong earned his reputation by conducting a five-hour operation to save a young woman's uterus, removing 419 fibroid tumors individually. Other doctors had suggested a hysterectomy.  \"I think about each patient's future,\" he said.  He now works in private hospitals where a consultation usually costs 420 yuan, about 60 times the official fee when he worked in public hospitals.  Some people have criticized Gong for \"only working for the rich\", but he countered by pointing out that doctors at private hospitals save patients hours of waiting, and more important, give more time to each consultation - at least 15 minutes.  \"The doctors and the patients both benefit,\" he said.  Since 2009, government regulations have allowed doctors to register at more than one hospital or start their own clinics, but Gong has been a lonely pioneer.  By 2015, about 45,000 doctors had registered at more than one hospital, but only about 37 percent came from top public hospitals.  Those who hesitate to break away fear the loss of patients, because top public hospitals always have thousands more cases than private establishments.  \"Chinese people prefer to judge doctors by the hospitals they work for,\" Gong said. \"They trust public hospitals and trust the medical staff. So freelance doctors, who have been stereotyped as quacks in the past, have to compete in the market.\"  Doctors must offer excellent services to please their patients, according to Gong, who established a website called China Obstetrics and Gynecology in 2000.  Initially, he used the site to share research and professional essays from overseas, but after he uploaded a video about a new method of treating postpartum bleeding, he received a message: \"I saved a uterus today after learning about the treatment through your online video. Thank you very much.\"  That moment made Gong realize the huge power of the internet.  In 2012, he wrote an article in which he claimed that many women were diagnosed or even prescribed treatments for \"cervical erosion\", which is not a real condition in his opinion. He put the essay on Sina Weibo, where it was quickly reposted 33,000 times and garnered more than 4,000 comments.  He also has millions of followers on WeChat and other online clinics that share medical science and advice. He also offers two pregnancy apps.  Now, about 90 percent of his patients come to him through the internet.  The government is stepping up efforts to improve medical services. During the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-20), medical consultations via family doctors will be encouraged, and the government will pilot a hierarchical medical system in 85 percent of China's regions. Medical competence at the grassroots level will be improved and more resources will be allocated for lower-tier institutions.  Gong and his team have also begun working with public hospitals in second- and third-tier cities, seeing patients and conducting surgeries at hospitals in the provinces of Hebei and Zhejiang.  Gao Xia, vice-president of the Zhangjiakou Women and Children's Hospital, said Gong's service not only attracts more patients, but also helps to train local staff: \"Patients do not need to go to Beijing to see good doctors.\"  Every month, Gong flies to two or three cities, and even though his life is busier, he feels freer.  \"I will keep working hard to improve healthcare in China,\" he said.

{"content": "Starting on Monday, global tourists can go to northern Beijing's Yanqing district to enjoy splendid parks and gardens at the 2019 International Horticultural Exhibition near the Great Wall and the Guishui River. The district has made sound preparations for an expected 16 million tourists who will visit in the next 162 days, with work done in the fields of travel, tasting, residences, retail and entertainment. Yanqing has renovated nine roads, 36 residential communities, more than 50 villages and eight towns around the exhibition site, and also built lighting projects over nightscapes to improve the sightseeing environment. He Haijun, deputy director of the Yanqing district commission of urban management, said local authorities have arranged 2.6 million potted plants and flowers in more than 10 types, setting up nine large flower terraces on main streets. Tourists can even enjoy the blooming flowers during their journey to the exhibition site, conveying a festive happy atmosphere, He said. Along with building and rebuilding roads linked to the exhibition site, Beijing authorities have arranged to add trains and buses to ease traffic pressure between downtown Beijing and Yanqing. A 42.2-kilometer expressway linking Beijing's northwestern Sixth Ring Road and Yanqing district was put into operation early this year, helping break a transportation bottleneck. Beijing's suburban S2 rail line will add more trains during the event, and nonstop trains have also been arranged. More bus routes and buses will be added, such as eight new bus routes running from downtown Beijing to the exhibition site and four regional bus routes to start operation in the district. In March, Yanqing launched a smart traffic system integrating intelligent traffic management and big data platforms for traffic services, according to Li Minwei, deputy director of the Yanqing district transport bureau. The system includes 222 cameras to supervise the road network, and LED screens to continuously share information on road conditions. The big data platform could summarize the traffic situations of the road network at peak periods, helping authorities prepare personnel to guide traffic on the spot and prevent and reduce illegal behavior. Li said 10 parking lots have been built around the site to deal with traffic spikes, adding 22,000 parking spaces.

{"content": "BEIJING - President Xi Jinping on Friday visited Beijing's primary-level cadres and residents in downtown neighborhoods ahead of the Spring Festival and extended Lunar New Year greetings to Chinese people of all ethnic groups. Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, also inspected the preparation work for the Beijing 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games. When inspecting the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau, Xi stressed the city's glorious mission and weighty responsibility to safeguard the social stability of the national capital as 2019 marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.,Xi asked for coordinated efforts to promote work in all fields with resolve to complete the mission. Touring a \"hutong,\" or traditional alley, in central Beijing's Qianmen area, Xi ordered the efforts to protect cultural heritage sites and conserve traditional culture while renovating the city's old areas. He called for both improving local residents' living conditions and protecting historical and cultural deposits, so that history and modernity will perfectly blend. He stressed specific measures to maintain the original features of hutong areas. Xi dropped into two courtyards along the hutong, inquiring about the living conditions of local residents after the renovation projects in the neighborhood. \"What the CPC pursues is to make the people's life better,\" he told the residents, gladly chatting and making dumplings with them.,Noting close attention from the CPC Central Committee to the renovation of old towns and shanty areas, Xi said that the Party aims to create a more comfortable and better living environment for the people and solve problems they care about most so that they can enjoy modern life even in old hutong areas. After chatting with residents, Xi went to a property service center to visit staff and community workers. On the way back, Xi dropped in on a restaurant, chatted with the owner and some customers and wished them good luck.,Xi also called on a nearby express delivery station and visited the deliverymen who were on duty, stressing that priority should be given to solving employment problems and creating more jobs. At 3:30 pm, Xi arrived at the Shougang Park in Shijingshan District, the seat of the Beijing Organizing Committee for the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games, to learn about the preparation for the Games and the planning and construction of the venues and infrastructure. Xi stressed the need to stay committed to hosting the Games in a green, sharing, open and clean manner, and to complete all preparation tasks with high standards. The venue construction must meet the Olympic standards and be completed on time, Xi said.,Stressing that the features of technology, intelligence, greenness and frugality should be highlighted, Xi said advanced technological approaches should be applied, energy-saving and environmental friendly requirements should be strictly enforced, the environment and cultural relics should be well protected, and Chinese styles should be on full display. Xi visited the office building of the Beijing Organizing Committee, meeting with some of the staff and volunteers there. Noting that Beijing will become the world's only host of both the Summer and Winter Olympics, he stressed that China must fulfill the solemn commitments it made to the world.,\"Hosting the 2022 Winter Olympics is an important support to the coordinated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region,\" Xi said, adding that Hebei Province must develop together with Beijing. During his visit to the national winter sports training center, Xi stressed promoting sportsmanship with Chinese characteristics, boosting coordinated development of mass sports, competitive sports and the sports industry, and speeding up building China into a country strong on sports. Vice Premier Han Zheng, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, accompanied Xi on the inspection tour of the preparation work for the Beijing 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games.", "overall-label": "politics"}

{"content": "Documentary director Liu Junwei had been planning to make a documentary about Zhongguancun, China's entrepreneurial and innovation hub in Beijing, for years. But he needed a peg for the story. And 2018 provided the perfect opportunity as it was the 40th anniversary of reform and opening-up. Speaking about why he wanted to make the documentary, Liu says: \"Everyone has heard of Zhongguancun, but some still think it's a market for electronic goods.\" As he researched Zhongguancun, he realized the electronics market was just the outcome of one phase of the area's development. So what is the secret of Zhongguancun, and what does it mean for the social and economic development of today's society? With these questions in mind, Liu started to shoot the documentary. The six-episode documentary named after the area, aired in December on the science and education channel of China Central Television, looks at Chinese entrepreneurs and internet companies such as Baidu, Sohu and Netease. According to Jin Ling, the producer, the documentary took 18 months to complete. \"Many think that Zhongguancun is just a place in Beijing's Haidian district, but this documentary also includes 17 locations in the city,\" says Jin. A special film crew took more than one year to shoot scenes in Zhongguancun in different seasons. And a research team was assigned to collect historical material, including photos, videos, documents and newspapers that would showcase the story of Zhongguancun.,\"The first generation of the entrepreneurs provided us with many rare materials, including old photos, mails, manuscripts and products,\" says Jin. And museums and corporate archives were also sources of material for the research team, as they contained documents such as the first registration certificate of a privately owned high-tech company. \"We also got material from the public. For example, an early Lenovo computer in the documentary is borrowed from a technology enthusiast,\" says Jin. The documentary features more than 100 people, including entrepreneurs, scientists, professionals, government officials and others who witnessed the development of Zhongguancun. Ni Guangnan from the Chinese Academy of Engineering impressed Liu with his attitude. \"He is still thinking about development and industrialization, and he is also helping young people,\" says Liu.,Two themes connect the stories in the six-episode documentary-one is the timeline and the other focuses on the development of Zhongguancun, from independent innovation centers there to market reforms and international cooperation. \"The significance of Zhongguancun is to show how science and technology is the primary productive force, and the importance of fundamental research and talent training,\" says Liu. One of Liu's interviewees says in the film that Zhongguancun is a top hub of scientific and technological innovation. Liu says the people in Zhongguancun \"live in the future\". \"Our discussion about the significance of Zhongguancun is actually exploring the future,\" Liu adds.", "overall-label": "tech"}

Organized by Beijing municipal government, Expo 2019 Beijing will open on April 29. According to the organizer, the preparatory work has entered the final stage. Wang Hong, vice mayor of Beijing, deputy director and deputy secretary-general of the executive committee of Expo 2019 Beijing said that all the preparations for the exhibition are ready. It is estimated that about 110 international exhibitors and more than 120 non-official international organizations will join the 162-day expo. She also indicated that the opening ceremony, the opening activities, National Museum's Day professional summit, international competition, and more than 2,500 series of activities, so that visitors enjoy the international gardening feast, at the same time, experience the diversity of cultural feast around the world. According to the overall arrangement of the preparatory work, the focus of the next stage will be shifted to indoor exhibition arrangement, exhibition services, and operation management during the expo. \"The expo marks a new driving force for the development of China's flower industry,\" said Jiang Zehui, President of China Flower Association, and Vice-president of Organizing Committee of Expo 2019 Beijing. From 1984 to 2017, the area of flowers and plants in China increased from 14,000 hectares to 1.4 million hectares, the sales volume increased from 600 million yuan to 153.3 billion yuan, and the export volume increased from tens of millions of U.S. dollars to more than 600 million U.S. dollars. \"China has become the world's largest flower production center, also, an important flower consumer and flower import and export trading country,\" said Jiang. \"Hosting Expo 2019 will also bring new opportunities for global cooperation,\" she added. \"The horticulture industry is a sunshine industry,\" said Zhou Jianping, Executive Deputy Director-General of Beijing World Horticultural Expo Coordination Bureau. Zhou mentioned that when people meet the basic needs of life, they will chase higher requirements for the quality of life and more yearning for a better life. In his opinion, this is the reason why the flower industry has entered every citizen's family and become an indispensable part of people's life. \"I believe that by holding such an expo, the flower horticulture industry will get a great development,\" Zhou added. Also, the Expo also put forward the concept of \"ecological priority\" by diversity, respecting the basic idea of environmental protection. As Zhou said, the organizing committee has ensured the original trees through various technical means, leaving nearly 50,000 original trees in the park. It is these original trees that provide a green shade for the exhibition. Besides, the International competition is an important part of the expo, more than half a year, during which many international competitions and competitions will be held.

{"content": "  Works from the Leiden Collection made their China debut on Friday. The 74 old master paintings are on show at the National Museum of China in Beijing through September. Lin Qi reports.  Thomas Kaplan says he has never \"lived\" with any of the 250 paintings from his collection. The 54-year-old entrepreneur and investor from the United States, along with his wife, Daphne, have since 2003 put together one of the largest collections of 17th-century Dutch paintings in private hands.  They call it the Leiden Collection, after the city where many featured master painters were based, including Rembrandt van Rijn.  Kaplan says he has never seen his entire collection together. So, when he viewed an exhibition showcasing 30 of his paintings at the Louvre in February, he was \"shocked\".  \"People said you must be very proud(of the collection). I said pride has nothing to do with it. I didn't paint them.\"  Also shocked were visitors, although they had seen many of the paintings at museums before.  The Kaplans have \"enjoyed\" anonymity for the past 13 years while lending their paintings to 40 museums.  \"In addition to being one of the most aggressive buyers of old masters, we've also been a lending library in Dutch art,\" says Kaplan.  \"The concept of sharing the collection has been part of our philosophy from the first day.\"    The collection made its China debut on Friday. It features 74 paintings at the National Museum of China in Beijing through September, celebrating the most acclaimed period of the Dutch Golden Age. It will later move to the Long Museum in Shanghai.  The exhibition titled Rembrandt and His Time includes 11 works by Rembrandt and one by Johannes Vermeer.  \"Vermeer and Rembrandt are considered to be the two greatest geniuses of this period (the Dutch Golden Age),\" says John Stainton, deputy chairman of Christie's old master paintings department, who was at the Beijing opening.  Kaplan purchased works largely through dealers and also at auctions by Christie's and Sotheby's. Between 2003 and 2008, he bought on average one painting every week.  \"Our desire is to build a collection of the best of its kind.\"  Speaking about the Kaplans' quest, Stainton says: \"There are a good number of Dutch 17th-century paintings in private hands. The very best of them are relatively few. But there are still very fine works that come to the market.\"  He says the exhibition is important to helping people understand what was going at the time in the Dutch Republic (1581-1795), which is now the Netherlands.  \"It was a new republic, so the people felt very free for the first time. Commercially, there was a burgeoning wealthy middle class. And artistically, one saw an explosion of creative talent, with this middle class commissioning and buying artists' works,\" Stainton says.  \"It fostered an environment in which artists could really flourish. That is why it was a high point of European old master painting when there was so much creative talent in a relatively short period.\"  The exhibition also features Jan Lievens' Boy in a Cape and Turban, the collection's first loan. It was displayed at Los Angeles' J. Paul Getty Museum in 2004 and'05.  Kaplan says he saw in the audience a young girl visiting with her class.  \"She was so mesmerized by the painting that she was standing there (in front of the painting) alone while the rest of her class walked on. From that moment on, I realized that it's all about sharing our paintings,\" he says.  Kaplan says loaning his collection helps to bridge cultures just like Rembrandt did. He says that for many people, art is a pass to different kinds of social acceptance and power, but that is not important to them.  \"We believe Rembrandt, almost uniquely, lends himself to being able to build bridges between cultures. We don't view him as being an instrument of cultural imperialism,\" he says.  \"And one being able to see Rembrandt is a means of showing what unites us, much more than what divides us.\"  The collection launched an online catalog in January for people who are interested in information on the 175 works and articles written by museum curators.  \"People tell me what a useful tool it is, and it is the reason why very early on we decided we didn't want to do a book. We wanted to be democratically available for students, curators, collectors, auction houses, dealers and historians,\" says Kaplan.  \"With the privilege of being able to own it comes the responsibility of magnifying it for the benefit of the public.\"  He says he believes that China will become a major factor in the enduring appreciation of Europ's old masters (painters before about 1800).  \"In so many areas of today's world, I see China as being the future. I'm not alone in saying that. It's a cliche,\" he says.  \"But some of the areas in which I predict China is the future are not necessarily unanimously viewed to be the case.One of them, as I believe, is that China is clearly making a huge impact on the art world.\"  Stainton from Christie's says that they've seen an enormous growth in buying interest in old masters from Asia, especially China, in the last five years.  He says half of the six bidders were Asian when it auctioned in London a painting by Peter Rubens that had been previously exhibited in Hong Kong last summer.  \"That would not have happened 10 years earlier and maybe even five years ago.\"  9 am-5 pm, closed on Mondays, through Sept 3. 16 East Chang'an Avenue, Dongcheng district, Beijing. 010-6511-6400.

{"content": "Beijing will take new measures to control the number of cars without local licenses on roads to ease traffic and reduce pollution, the local government announced on Friday. Starting on Nov 1 next year, cars not licensed by Beijing will have only 12 permits a year to enter the city, with each permit effective for seven days. Under the policy, non-Beijing cars can only be driven in the city for a total of 84 days a year, and they must be parked in residential parking lots the rest of the time. \"There have been too many cars with non-Beijing licenses on the roads in recent years, which has made traffic worse,\" said Ding Zhe, 42, a local resident who now takes the subway to work, even though he owns a car with Beijing plates, because of traffic congestion. Beijing had 5.97 million locally registered cars as of April, according to the Beijing Commission of Transport. However, there are constantly more than 700,000 non-Beijing-registered cars in use in the downtown areas\u00a3\u00adthe number of all the cars in Hong Kong. The government aims to cap the number of locally registered cars at below 6.3 million by the end of 2020. The city has also made more efforts to improve public transportation. It has 22 subway lines with a combined length of 602 kilometers. An additional 397 km of subway lines are planned by 2021. Beijing adopted a lottery policy in 2010 to curb the rising number of new cars in the city. Under the policy, a person must win a license through a lottery before buying a new car. Because of the limited number of plates in the lottery system, many residents began registering their new cars in other cities. Car dealers also provide the service to help buyers obtain a non-Beijing license at a fee of about 4,500 yuan ($700). Car owners only need to put a record online to get permission on a weekly basis to drive in the city, although there are a few restrictions, including not being allowed to drive in some central areas. In 2015, the authority gave out 50,000 permits each day. In 2016, the number soared to 100,000 a day. Since 2017, the authority has given out 725,000 permits each week. \"Giving such a permission is to allow non-Beijing residents to drive to Beijing on business or leisure purposes. Driving a non-Beijing-licensed car permanently in the city has abused the lottery policy,\" said Zhang Rui, an associate professor of city planning at Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture. \"Even though there is strong demand for cars, city policymakers still have to put social fairness as a priority to ensure the effectiveness of existing regulations,\" she said. Yuan Maocun, a transportation specialist at the Ministry of Transport, said Beijing's limited resources and capacity have made it necessary to control car numbers. \"The new policy has given people 17 months to deal with their cars,\" Yuan said. Su Lei, 30, an engineer in Beijing, said he had his car licensed outside of Beijing three years ago. \"I seldom drive to downtown. I both live and work in the suburbs,\" he said. \"If I cannot drive it every day, I have to use friends' cars, because public transportation is not very convenient in the suburbs.\" He has been in the lottery for six years, but has not yet been lucky enough to get a Beijing license plate.", "overall-label": "business"}
{"content": "Art can help us see life's big picture and puts creativity in the frame of our lives, says Ke Lu, 41, an artist who believes the senses, and sense of wonder, we had in our youth have been dulled by the demands of modern society. \"Our senses may have been eroded by information overdose and the demand for instant gratification made possible by advanced technologies\", says Ke, who founded the Dashanpai Theater Art Center in 2012. The center aims to apply drama as a tool for aesthetic education to help restore a sense of creativity, especially among teenagers. It is paying dividends. On June 29, members of the center will perform The Little Prince at Tsinghua University, adapted from the French novel of the same name written by Antoine de Saint-Exupery. In the past seven years, the center, based in Wangjing in Beijing's Chaoyang district, has put on seven plays based on famous literature, and has also run themed workshops to inspire youngsters to express themselves through the medium of performance. Ke, who as a child was fascinated by painting, didn't receive any professional art training until he attended a lecture at the Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts when he was a 13-year-old middle school student. That lecture is seared into his memory.,Ke clearly recalls his first meeting with what he considered the \"cool\", long-haired art teacher who, in his first class, compared an artist's job to that of a divine creator. Decades later, his teacher's words still ring in his ears: \"Do you know what kind of job you will be doing in the future? That is like god's job. Facing a blank piece of paper, a piece of chaotic mud, an empty room, you are god, and you have to create beautiful things in your mind.\" Ke says: \"That moment defined my fate and belief.\" Encouraged by his master, Ke then explored various fields like painting, animation, film and television, until he found his true love: drama and the stage, and its \"unlimited potential\". In 2017, his art center was acknowledged by the faculty of Tsinghua University High School. Work carried out by the center was designated a required course among their students. Last year, the center expanded its influence to launch its plays and workshops in more high schools in several cities, including Beijing municipality as well as Zhenjiang, in East China's Jiangsu province. During the process, Ke found many educators shared similar ideas and goals. Zhao Guoqiang, principal of Zhenjiang Foreign Language International School, says: \"The drama course inspires student creativity, and boosts their ability to learn. \"It promotes the development of children, teachers and the cultural construction of the school.\" Chen Shuhua, 60, co-founder of the art center from Taiwan, thinks that children and teenagers are too obsessed with electronic gadgets. \"In my childhood, I had no toys or games to play with. I just had the mountains behind my house to explore. I got the chance to feel the shape of the breeze and to hear the croak of frogs,\" Chen says. \"It's a pity that few people today have the time to sense the beauty of the environment around them.\" Chen claims that the art center wants to give the five senses\u00a3\u00adseeing, smelling, hearing, tasting and touching\u00a3\u00adback to children, and inspire them to discover their natural creativity.,The center put on a performance in March of The Old Man and the Sea, based on Ernest Hemingway's novel of the same title, at Tsinghua University in Beijing. Before the drama began, Ke ran an interactive education experiment with the audience. He dropped a sandbag, a wooden ball and a pingpong ball on stage. He then asked the audience to imitate and compare the movements of the objects. Five audience members were invited to go onstage to perform their imitations, showing their observation and imagination. Rolling or jumping, they were all lauded by Ke and the audience applauded wildly. The play began shortly after. On the simply set stage, the sea and the sky were projected onto the background, while wooden boards, a lamp, a rope and a small statue of the Virgin Mary served as a boat. An inflated balloon represented the moon. The body language of the actors completed the theatrical effects. For instance, when pulled taut by the actors, the rope became a fishing pole and the struggle between the old fisherman and the giant marlin was presented in the form of wresting. The imagination of the audience is vital for the stage, Ke says. In part this is because of obvious limitations\u00a3\u00ada wild raging sea cannot be transported onto the stage\u00a3\u00adand imagination gives added value to the audience. \"We don't want to present the stage as an obvious answer, we want it to collaborate with audiences' imagination and create even more possibilities of image and understanding,\" Ke says.,Zhang Yanhua, a teacher at Tsinghua University Primary School, brought her 9-year-old son Liu Zicheng to the show. Zicheng was deeply impressed by the creativity. Another audience member, Dorothy Jiang, a mother of two girls, says that the play can easily grab children's attention with the energetic body language of the actors coupled with the frequent audience interaction. Ke believes that to develop the ability to spot and savor beauty, people have to start by discovering themselves. Life's different stages Kong Minxing, 10, a student at the Chinese Academy of Agriculture Sciences Elementary School in Beijing, has been attending Dashanpai's aesthetic education courses for two years. Last year, he joined the cast as a part-time actor, and his performance in March playing Manolin, the little boy from The Old Man and the Sea, earned widespread acclaim. Minxing describes the art courses as \"compelling\". He says: \"Ke let me see sounds. He tapped a bowl filled with water and I saw splashes and waves. I felt the expansion of my own body by walking on people's backs, as they created stairs for me to climb and reach for the roof.\" He benefited from these exercises, saying that his \"ability to concentrate has been hugely improved\". His father, Kong Weimeng, claims that his son used to be an introvert. \"My son used to spend too much time playing video games. Learning to perform drama and interacting with the art center's crew opened a window into creativity for him,\" he says. \"Ke uses artistic language to allow people to notice what's easily ignored in daily life. To 'see' sounds, to act, and to 'paint' with a voice\u00a3\u00adit soothes and comforts your soul.\"", "overall-label": "life-style"}
{"content": "Imagine a box with four wheels, cruising down the street without a steering wheel or an accelerator pedal. In Chen Jiadong's unromantic vision, that's what driverless cars will be like. But the 32-year-old worker, a car-racing fan, believes driverless vehicles will not spoil the fun of driving. \"Driving all the day is so tiring. If cars can drive themselves in line with rules, then traffic accidents may be reduced and efficiency can be improved,\" he said. Chen's wish is not far out of reach. Chinese companies are racing against rivals to mass produce autonomous vehicles, as the government is said to be expediting rules and regulations. Nearly one-third of the more than 30 firms getting permission to conduct self-driving road tests in California, the United States, are from China, according to the California Department of Motor Vehicles. Many of these companies are startups, including Drive.ai, JingChi Corp, Pony.ai, TuSimple and Nuro. Internet giant Baidu Inc is also one of these players, and Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp is the only traditional vehicle company. It's widely believed in the auto and technology industry that commercial usage of self-driving vehicles will come to fruition in 2020. But Chinese firms may be two years ahead of the global target. Baidu plans to launch \"small-scale production\" of fully autonomous mini-buses this July, according to Robin Li, CEO of the Chinese tech giant. \"The monitoring system developed by Baidu can monitor whether a driver is tired or not. If the driver is tired, the system will issue a warning and perk up the driver with a cheerful song,\" Li said during a conference. Startup JingChi Corp plans to deploy the first fleet of 50 self-driving taxis in Anqing, East China's Anhui province by this March. Customers could order self-driving taxis through a ride-hailing app, and during the test period, the cab will have a \"safety officer\" in the driver's seat, said Wang Jing, founder and CEO of JingChi. \"As the government gradually shapes policies and regulations of automated vehicles and more passengers get used to the service, we would consider removing the safety officer in the future,\" Wang said. Backed by venture capital, more and more companies are jumping on the bandwagon. Momenta, a Beijing-based firm providing road sensors and high definition mapping software, received $46 million of funding in July 2017. TuSimple, an autonomous truck startup that develops technology for autonomous long-distance freight delivery, raised $55 million in November 2017. The companies' devotion to the revolutionary technologies was shored up by Chinese consumers' enthusiasm, as well as the government's positive attitude. More than 60 percent of survey respondents in China believe their families will be riding in autonomous cars in the future, said a recent report by management consulting firm McKinsey & Co. China aims to install driver-assistant systems or partly autonomous driving systems to more than 50 percent of new vehicles by 2020, and to produce highly and fully autonomous cars for the market by 2025. That's according to a development plan for the automobile industry jointly issued in April 2017 by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, and the National Development and Reform Commission, China's top economic regulator. Nevertheless, there is still a long way to go before self-driving vehicles enter large-scale commercial operation. \"I'd like to have a try when driverless taxis hit the road, but the premise is that the car is safe,\" said Yin Nan, 38, who works with a nonprofit organization. \"If an accident happens, who will be responsible for that?\" Yin's nagging doubt was not groundless. One of the biggest problems for driverless cars is that hackers may enter the vehicles' operating system, according to Deng Feng, co-founder of Northern Light Venture Capital. \"Technological hurdles may include the accuracy of digital maps and the high cost of producing light detection and ranging devices\u00a3\u00adlaser-sensing 'eyes' used in self-driving car systems,\" said Zhao Xiang, a senior analyst at Beijing-based internet consultancy Analysys. Still, it is the permissiveness of regulations, rather than technologies, that will set the pace of the commercial use of this technology, Deng Feng said. \"It's difficult to predict the timeline of driverless vehicles' mass production. Some Chinese companies are getting ready to wheel out their vehicles, but the schedule may be delayed due to regulation issues rather than technology lag,\" he said on the sidelines of a recent tech summit organized in Beijing by media outlet ifeng.com. To speed up the development of the self-driving technology, the government has been drafting relevant guidelines and regulations. In mid-December 2017, the country's first guideline on road tests of autonomous motor vehicles was released by local authorities in Beijing. The guideline makes it clear that independent entities registered in China can apply to test at most five vehicles at a time, and they must first complete tests in designated closed zones before conducting road tests. The list of road sections eligible for such tests will soon be released, according to the Beijing local authorities. Later that month, the Ministry of Transport said that it would conduct research to promulgate policies related to autonomous driving technology this year. When making related laws and regulations, many issues need to be taken into consideration, said Gao Yifei, a professor from Southwest University of Political Science and Law. \"For example, how to ensure the security and reliability of self-driving vehicles? What will happen after autonomous vehicles are driven on the road? What if driverless vehicles cannot recognize gestures of traffic police?\" Kuang Ziping, founding managing partner of the Shanghai-based Qiming Venture Partners, said the industry expects favorable policies will be carried out soon. \"All in all, the government authorities, both at the national and local levels, are supportive of self-driving vehicles,\" Kuang said.", "overall-label": "tech"}
{"content": "BEIJING - A month away from the 2019 Beijing International Horticultural Exhibition, workers are busy making final touches to the expo pavilions and gardens to ensure they will shine during the global event. Slated to kick off on April 29, the 162-day expo is poised to impress an expected number of 16 million visitors from home and abroad with a huge collection of plants, flowers and eye-catching pavilions as well as ideas for green development. More than 110 countries and international organizations as well as over 120 non-official exhibitors have confirmed participation, marking the highest attendance in the expo's history. The exhibitors will vie to present their latest achievements in floriculture in the 503-hectare expo site at the foot of the Great Wall in Beijing's Yanqing district. At the center of the expo site stands the Chinese Pavilion, a curved exhibition hall in the shape of \"ruyi,\" a traditional Chinese ornament symbolizing good fortune. As one of the expo's four main pavilions, it will display a wide variety of plant species from across China and showcase the history of Chinese gardening and horticulture. The design of the Chinese Pavilion echoes the expo's theme \"live green, live better.\" With most of its earth-sheltered structure embedded in man-made terrace fields, both heat and humidity will be well preserved, said Jing Quan with the China Architecture Design and Research Group. The rainwater collection system on the pavilion's steel roof and a storage pond underground will be used for terrace field irrigation, Jing said, adding that more than 1,000 photovoltaic glass panels have been installed on the roof to utilize solar energy. Such exquisite designs are also found in other main pavilions such as the International Pavilion featuring 94 pillars in the shape of flower umbrella and the butterfly-shaped, multicolored Guirui Theater which will host the expo's opening and closing ceremonies. China's 31 provincial-level regions as well as Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan will showcase their iconic cultural elements in outdoor exhibit areas, such as the giant panda-themed garden set up by Sichuan province, miniature Mogao Grottoes by Gansu province and a model of ancient Tibetan village house by Tibet autonomous region. The spotlight will also be on more than 40 gardens and pavilions built by international exhibitors and branded with each country's unique culture and history. Designed to show the quintessence of Japanese gardening, the Japan garden features a lovely courtyard dotted with trees, flowers, rocks, cascades and bamboo walls. The Azerbaijan Pavilion is modeled on a seashell, which symbolizes the country's \"dynamism and passion for development and innovation,\" said Narmin Jarchalova, director of the pavilion. Besides Azerbaijan's native plants, the pavilion will display the country's traditional handmade carpets and photos of its landmarks, Jarchalova said, adding that a pomegranate tree, \"a national symbol that embodies prosperity and fertility,\" has been planted beside the pavilion. \"The Beijing expo will serve as a platform for participating countries to showcase their distinctive cultures,\" said Jiao Yutong with the Beijing International Horticultural Exhibition Coordination Bureau. \"It will also provide countries with the opportunity to further cooperate in horticulture and agriculture.\" Tim Briercliffe, secretary general of the International Association of Horticultural Producers, said the Beijing expo would \"attract many visitors to learn about the importance of greening and plants in their lives.\" \"The expo provides an exciting opportunity to demonstrate to the world the latest thinking and new ideas on how plants and landscapes can make lives better,\" he said.", "overall-label": "life-style"}

More than 7,200 companies that discharge heavy pollution were investigated and nearly 4,000 of them were closed, according to the area's official account on WeChat, the country's leading social platform. Also, about 100 people involved were arrested, and detained for questioning about actions that might have contaminated the environment. The strong reaction by the authorities illustrates the determination of the area's leaders to tackle environmental problems. Xiongan New Area, established as part of the measures to advance the coordinated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, is required to put environmental safety first and adhere to green development.

Located about 100 km southwest of downtown Beijing, Xiongan spans Hebei's Xiongxian, Rongcheng, and Anxin counties. It also covers a major wetland in northern China - Baiyangdian Lake, which covers 366 square kilometers and is believed to be a key in improving the area's overall environment. But in the area is Baoding in Hebei province, usually one of the 10 cities with the worst air quality in the country. Baiyangdian's environment has been damaged for years by pollution resulting from fisheries and industrial waste water. To control the pollution, the three counties have taken a series of measures.

In its inaugural year, the school will offer a kindergarten as well as grades one and two. In addition to German, students are also taught Chinese, English and French. Staeuble said the school's textbooks, teacher training and quality assurance come from the Canton of Zurich, which has a long history of cultural and economic ties with China. The Swiss curriculum emphasizes a holistic and multilingual education, where children are at the center of the learning process and the focus is on developing academic knowledge as well as creative, sporting and social skills, she said. Jean-Jacques de Dardel, Swiss ambassador to China, said at the opening ceremony that the school offers a unique window into the Swiss education system, which has contributed significantly to Switzerland's present-day ranking as the most innovative country in the world. \"Switzerland has no raw materials to speak of. Our most important 'natural resource' is education,\" he said. \"The Swiss economy is not driven by mass production, but by the development and creation of high-quality goods. \"This means that the economy needs a steady supply of well-educated and skilled workers.

With the rise of millennials in the workforce and the government's supportive policies such as the so-called mass entrepreneurship innovation, the co-working space sector is booming, along with much of China's emerging sharing economy. According to an annual report released by the National Development and Reform Commission, more than 5.5 million new companies were registered last year, growing 24.5 percent year-on-year. By the end of 2016, the country had nearly 26 million registered enterprises, up 18.8 percent year-on-year. And the report noted that 41.7 percent of the entrepreneurs are young people, especially millennials. Seeing the huge potential in innovating away from traditional working offices, Hu Jing, the former executive vice-president of Chinese property developer Greenland Holding Group Co Ltd, established his co-working startup Distrii, to offer co-working spaces, coupled with online mobile office solutions. \"As more cities in China become highly developed and business concentrated, traffic congestion, air pollution and other city diseases pop up now, and the cost of commuting also has increased. All those problems are the real pain points for cities and will also reduce people's work efficiency,\" said Hu, now CEO of Distrii. Hu aims to build a community that allows employees to set up workplaces in the nearest co-working offices, instead of traveling for hours to a far-away office. \"Advances in technologies will enable us to live in the flexible, mobile, productive and convenient working environment, marking a key point to the smarter future. \"Co-workers are able to deal with company tasks online via our mobile office solutions and communicate with other company employees in the working building to expand their social circles,\" he said. According to statistics on the official website, more than 450 companies have registered to use properties offered by the Shanghai-based co-working space operator. Currently, Distrii has set up 15,000 working spaces in four cities, Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Singapore. The company said it would unveil its flagship franchise in Singapore next April. In September, the company announced it had raised 200 million yuan in series A financing to further expand its light-asset office network and start to tap into overseas markets in the Asia-Pacific, Southeast Asia and North America regions. \"Our co-working mode is more than simply renting working offices. We aim to connect people with the facilities via the internet, making them into part of the smart city plan,\" Hu added. Once users sign up to use the co-working building, they can simply use smartphones to unlock the office door and check in automatically via the internet. And the serviced offices will offer more functions, including tele-conferencing and video-conferencing. \"Currently, we especially target small and medium-sized companies, which account for around 70 percent of the total domestic firms, aiming to help them reduce the costs on operation and IT spending.\" A report released by consultancy iResearch showed that there is huge potential in China's co-working industry. According to the report, the domestic market in China reached 4.29 billion yuan ($650 million) in 2016, and the number is expected to hit 9.35 billion yuan by 2019. Feng Chao, an analyst at internet research company Analysys, noted that co-working companies need to offer favorable prices and comfortable working environments to accumulate enough users. \"The key is to introduce more value-added services,\" Feng said. \"It should be more than simply providing renting offices and should involve more needed services, such as training and a community network.\"", "overall-label": "business"}

Around 30,000 audience from home and abroad watched artists from across Asia perform folk dances, play traditional musical instruments or sing popular songs from their homeland. Upasana Madan, an Indian dancer, said she felt thrilled to be back on a Chinese stage 18 years after a three-week performing tour in China. \"Everyone is coming and sharing their cultures. We see artists from other countries and understand their cultures through their dance and music,\" she said. \"It is beautiful how this program is bringing all these countries together.\" Apanaeva Gyuzel, who led a team of Russian artists to attend the carnival, told Xinhua that she and her fellow artists were honored to present Russian culture at the event and carefully chose a dance that could best showcase the characteristics of Russian people. \"The stage, equipped with the latest visual technologies, is very impressive, and the show is so spectacular. We learned a lot and made many friends,\" she said. \"It is indeed a great journey.\" The audience was fascinated by the performances and visual effects of the stage, as many stood up, applauded, and waved glow sticks in their hands, singing and swaying with the music. \"This show brings back memories of the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics.

Speaking during a news briefing on the sidelines of CIIE, Slepnev said the expo has already shown that it is a world-class event by its scale and the number of political and business leaders in attendance. The Russian delegation is led by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev. After the expo opened on Monday, he briefed President Xi Jinping at the Russian pavilion about the achievements of the two nations in the fields of nuclear power, natural gas and aviation. At a later meeting with Medvedev on Monday, Xi said China and Russia should continue to deepen cooperation in many areas, including energy, agriculture, finance, science and innovation. The trade volume between China and Russia reached more than $77 billion in the first three quarters of the year, a rise of 25.7 percent from the same period a year before, the Ministry of Commerce said. The rate of growth is the fastest among all of China's main trading partners, and the bilateral trade volume is expected to reach $100 billion this year, the ministry said. Slepnev said more than 100 Russian companies are taking part in the expo, and many signed cooperative agreements with their Chinese counterparts, mostly in the services and transport sectors, in the first two days. The expo has made it much easier and transparent for businesses to strike deals because it reduces intermediary procedures, and it allows foreign businesses to appreciate China's competitive environment and become acquainted with manufacturers from other countries. Slepnev noted that Russia has seen strong export growth to China since the start of the year, especially in forestry, steel and food products, and there has also been strong interest from Chinese buyers in Russian skin care, cosmetics and children's products. As part of efforts to increase Russian exports to China, the export center group will establish trade offices in Beijing and Shanghai, along with agencies in more than 20 cities nationwide to better serve Russian companies, he said, adding that the group will also help more Russian companies to pitch products via China's booming e-commerce platforms.", "overall-label": "business"}
{"content": "They swayed and stretched after receiving their instruction\u00a3\u00adseveral students moving their bodies to express the concept of \"space.\" That was how Tang Yi, a dance teacher at Beijing Normal University, demonstrated to the audience how to give a class on Laban's theory, a practical theory of dance, at the opening ceremony of the Asia-Pacific International Dance Education Conference. Held in Beijing from Oct 19 to 21, many experts from home and abroad took part in the conference to discuss how to cultivate dance talent, especially in a comprehensive university environment. BNU is widely regarded as a specialized university to train teachers, but it is also a comprehensive university, according to Xiao Xiangrong, the head of dance department at the university. That is especially true in terms of the university's dance department in contrast to a specialized art university like a conservatory or dance academy. In his opinion, specialized art schools focus on cultivating specific talents. For example, students who graduate from a dance academy usually strive to be professional dancers, but students who graduate from BNU's dance department may end up working in a number of dancing-related jobs, such as choreography, dance and teaching. A report on Chinese internet users' ability to appreciate beauty in dance, jointly prepared by BNU's dance department and the school of journalism and communication, was also released at the event. Xiao said that some of the results are surprising. First of all, Chinese internet users have strong aspiration for beauty, which, in Xiao's words, \"may coincide with the saying 'It is natural that human beings all take a fancy to beauty'.\" However, only a few people are able to derive the meaning of beauty from watching a dance performance. This, according to Zhang Yue, a student of BNU who participated in writing the report, \"may indicate that many people still believe dance is only for the minority\". \"However, we hope to bring dance to more people, to show them that everyone can enjoy it,\" she added. The report also notes that some Chinese netizens are more familiar with Latin dance, hip-hop and ballet, but they seldom pay attention to traditional Chinese dance. \"Despite learning and advancing our experience of other countries, we should still remember our own culture,\" said Xiao. It was also found that it is primary school and university students that participate the most in dance activities, while middle and high school students participate the least. \"It indicates that our dance education is utilitarian to some extent. In middle and high schools, dance has to give way to 'major' subjects like Chinese, maths and English,\" said Xiao. In terms of personal experiences related to dance, researchers were surprised to find the influence of square dancing. \"Square dancing, according to the report, can really enhance peoples' ability to appreciate beauty,\" said Xiao. \"Many experts look down on square dancing, but since it does exert influence on so many people, we need to guide it, to make the dancers really know about aesthetic culture in dance.\" Finally, the more influential media to spread dance right now are short-video apps like Douyin and Kuaishou. \"Such short videos cannot fully express the beauty of dance. For us dance educators, we want to discuss how to take advantage of such tools and lead people to theaters, which is a real world of dance (and the best place to appreciate its beauty),\" said Xiao. Researchers distributed about 50,000 questionnaires online and analyzed around 3,000 effective responses. Those who answered the questions were a good cross-section of society, from both urban and rural backgrounds and from different all age groups. Dance education for primary schools, middle schools, universities, training organizations and even the physically challenged were also among the topics discussed during the conference. Foreign experts also participated, sharing their ideas. Angela Carol Perry, an Australian dance teacher, introduced the curriculum from her country that asks students to learn the arts. They are required to learn music, drama, dance, media arts and visual arts from the ages of 5 to 13. After 13, they can select one or more art subjects to specialize in. Yoon Mira, one of the leading figures of new dance in the Republic of Korea, gave a lecture on Dalgubul dance, a Korean re-creation of traditional dance, which premiered in 1999. \"Our shared aspiration here today is to make dance walk into more people's hearts, become a key to open their minds, and a part of their lifestyle,\" guest speaker Chen Xiaoli, a deputy division director of Beijing Municipal Education Commission, said at the event.", "overall-label": "life-style"}

Through its online service, customers can fill in application forms online, submit ID photos, hand in scanned versions of their marriage certificate, ID card, passport and confirm all the materials are correct and accurate before they are submitted.  \"This has saved a lot of communication time for our clients. Before, only half of the application materials were valid during their first submission, and it took two or three times on average for offline visa applications,\" Huang said.  The online visa service is a blessing for internet-savvy tourists, who are tired of the complex and outdated offline process.

To date, the online travel platform can help tourists apply for visas in 84 countries' embassies and consulates in China, and it also offers visa application reservations to 125 nations and regions.  The internet process also shortens the time needed to complete the application as well as reducing expenses on transportation and paper printing.  \"More than 60 percent of Ctrip's online tourism customers applied for their visas on smartphones, and 75 percent of their visa photos are selfies,\" Huang said.

With the resources of Alibaba Group, Alitrip will be able to automatically fill in the basic information of its customers according to his or her history, and even provide financial records and documents to ease the material collecting process from a couple of days to half an hour in the future, Zhou said.  Online visa application services offered by travel platforms are aimed at the large outbound traveling market from China. As many as 122 million trips were made to overseas destinations throughout 2016, spending a total of $109.8 billion, an annual report on Chinese overseas tourism by China Tourism Academy showed.  From January to June, 62 million trips were made to destinations outside China, up 5.4 percent year-on-year, and the whole year growth rate is expected to reach 6 percent, Xu Yi, an analyst from Guolian Securities, wrote.  Xu expected the Chinese outbound tourism market to maintain robust growth as less than 10 percent of the Chinese population holds a passport.  A modern visa service is regarded as an important step to win customers; in addition, the data collected through the service will enable platforms to come up with more tailor-made products for target customers, said analysts.

{"content": "The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei integrated development plan, a part of China's national strategies, has achieved tangible results since its inception five years ago and helped the government to redistribute resources and industries in the capital to nearby regions for better growth, a senior official said. \"For environmental improvement, transportation and industrial cooperation, we have achieved rapid growth in the past years under the guidance of the integrated development plan,\" said Liu Bozheng, deputy head of the Beijing coordinated development office, at a conference in Tongzhou, where Beijing's municipal government and other agencies sitting in a sub-city complex are located. President Xi Jinping called for the integrated and coordinated development of Beijing and the two neighboring areas during a symposium on Feb 26, 2014. On April 30, 2015, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei integrated development plan was approved, making it clear that the region will be built into a world-class city cluster with the capital as the core. The three local governments have been working together since then on environmental protection including afforestation and combating air pollution. In the past five years, Beijing and Hebei have built forests with a total area of 333 square kilometers and the capital's PM 2.5 levels, a measure of air pollution alerts, dipped to a record low last year. The development plan had urged the construction of a mature transportation network in the region. Since then, it takes just one hour for rail travel between Beijing, Tianjin and Baoding in Hebei. The Beijing Daxing International Airport, which is expected to become North China's air travel hub, is situated on the border of Beijing and Langfang, Hebei. The new airport, scheduled to be put into use later this year, will help to improve the efficiency of the airports' resources in Tianjin and Shijiazhuang, capital of Hebei. The new airport's completion will help to boost the development of the four strategic areas in the region - like the Beijing New Airport Economic Zone. According to the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Integrated Development Office, the other three are the Caofeidian Integrated Development Zone in Hebei, Tianjin Binhai New Area and the Zhangjiakou-Chengde Ecological Area, also in Hebei. These zones will help boost economic growth in the region, and the three governments have carried out a series of cooperation projects in the past five years. For instance, Beijing's Zhongguancun group has invested heavily in Tianjin in science and technology. Some high-end projects of Beijing companies such as automobile manufacturing have been shifted to Hebei. According to data from the office, Beijing has invested 700 billion yuan ($105 billion) in Tianjin and Hebei for key industrial projects between 2015 and 2018. Between Jan 16 and 18 this year, Xi inspected Tianjin and other cities in Hebei province and took stock of the reports on the integrated development in the region. Xi also visited Beijing's sub-city center in Tongzhou on Jan 18 after the Beijing municipal government moved to the new administration buildings in the district. Shi Jianxun, an economist with Tongji University said the integrated development of this region has entered a new phase. He said regional development will get new impetus, especially as the sub-city center will be key to Beijing in the new era. Tianjin, a port city with a population of 14 million, and Hebei, a traditional industrial and transportation hub, will embrace their new development chances during the capital's resources and industries' redistribution, he said.", "overall-label": "business"}

{"content": "A primary school in Beijing is working hard to promote winter sports Wang Aoyun, 11, is a fifth-grade student at Taipingzhuang Central Primary School in Yanqing district, Beijing. She was born in the summer of 2008 and her name means Olympics in Chinese. Wang is a member of the Yanqing Youth Speed Skating Team. And she once won the women's junior group 400 meters in the Yanqing's \"Mini Winter Olympics\" youth speed skating competition. Her skating training began in 2016 at a large ice rink built by the school.,The Beijing Yanqing Taipingzhuang Central Primary School is a full-time rural primary school. And Wang's training rink is located in the east campus of the primary school. It was originally a farmland where teachers and students planted corn and vegetables. But in November 2016, with the support of the Yanqing district education committee, the Taipingzhuang Central Primary School spent more than 800,000 yuan ($118,092) to build this 1,800 square meter seasonal ice rink, and equipped students with skates and protective gear. The school then hired a retired physical education teacher, Li Chunyu from Manzhouli, Inner Mongolia, as the children's skating coach.,Now, more than 140 students from the school practice ice sports for one hour every day in winter. The ice rink was completed in less than two years, and has become an ice paradise for the students. In addition to a fixed hour of free ice-time every day, students can also join the skating interest group after school for on-court training. Also, many parents learn to skate while waiting to pick up their children.,\"An ice rink is easy to build but maintenance is a problem,\" says Ding Jianpei, the headmaster of the school, adding that in order to maintain the ice rink a lot of work is needed. In order to ensure that the rink is in good condition, Ding ices the rink the first thing in the morning. And later in the day, the teachers, students and parents clean the ice to prepare it for use at night. \"When the temperature is too high, it is not good. But generally, when the temperature drops to -8 C, we pour ice,\" he says.,According to Ding, pouring of ice is usually carried out in the middle of the night. If the weather is bad (high temperature), they will spend the whole night doing it. The hard work done by Ding and the teachers is rewarding. Almost all the students in Taipingzhuang Central Primary School have learned to skate. And many students have already participated in competitions in Yanqing district, with many achieving good rankings.,This ice rink has also led to the development of the students on the ice project of the adjacent Kangzhuang Primary School, the Xiayu Primary School and the Xiaofengying Primary School. \"We want to plant the seed of winter sports in the hearts of students. \"This seed may not grow into a towering tree as most of them will not engage in snow and ice sports, but as long as they realize the joy of winter sports while growing up I feel that what we are doing is worth it,\" says Ding.", "overall-label": "education"}

In 2015, China and Italy signed a memorandum of understanding about setting up joint patrols in tourist spots in both nations - the first such agreement between China and a foreign country. Since then, China has sent more than 30 police officers to Italy to conduct joint patrols in three groups. Italy sent 16 police officers to China in two groups. In November 2016, the bureau co-hosted a law enforcement meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization with the foreign affairs department of the Beijing government and issued a cooperation declaration. Last year, groups from 15 countries and two international organizations in Southeast Asia were invited to take part in a law enforcement conference organized by the bureau. There were heated discussions on several judicial issues, including the fight against terrorists, drugs and cross-border crimes. They also established a long-term communication system to share police affairs. \"Thanks to such memorandums and law enforcement conferences, we've established trust with other countries, and that trust is the basis of judicial cooperation,\" Gao said. \"We'll maintain the trust to effectively solve crimes, supply better services for residents and guarantee the capital's security.\"", "overall-label": "education"}
{"content": "Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing has said it is now focusing on artificial intelligence and smart transportation innovation, as it attempts to expand its booming shared mobility empire into more fields and gain momentum in emerging industries. The company officially launched its AI Labs in Beijing on Friday, marking its latest step in expanding its research into AI-driven innovation, attracting top AI experts and boosting the development of smart traffic technologies. The move came shortly after the Beijing-based startup unveiled an integrated solution for smart city traffic management on Thursday. The technology employs traffic data collected from Didi's platform and data resources from local governments and business partners. \"Didi will not only build a comprehensive mobility platform to connect passengers and drivers, but also aims to become a smart transportation solutions provider in the future,\" Cheng Wei, founder and CEO of Didi, said on Thursday at a smart transportation forum in Beijing. With a team of more than 200 AI scientists and engineers, the company's new AI research lab will be led by Didi's vice-president Ye Jieping. It aims to address transportation-related challenges with a focus on natural language processing, computer vision and deep learning, among other areas. Didi said it has plans to further expand the new hub this year. The company currently operates three AI research labs: its new AI Labs, Didi Research Institute in Beijing and Didi Labs in Silicon Valley of the United States. \"The new AI Labs is dedicated to being a leader in driving cutting-edge transportation and mobility technologies, as well as a generator of AI talents,\" Ye said. He added that the new facility will also promote more AI applications in smart mobility scenarios, such as the Didi Smart Transportation Brain that helps to improve traffic flow efficiency in urban areas. Zhao Xiang, an analyst at Beijing-based internet consultancy Analysys, said by setting its sights on AI and smart transportation, Didi aims to transform itself from a simple mobility service provider into a technology company that offers big data and AI-driven services. \"Once the company is able to connect people, cars, roads, traffic lights and even the whole traffic system, the platform will generate a large amount of data. Thus Didi's future is of huge potential, especially in how it monetizes those services,\" Zhao said. Last year, Didi identified smart transportation as a new strategic direction, offering a wide range of smart transportation products and services for more than 20 cities nationwide, such as smart traffic lights and reversible lanes, to relieve traffic jams. In Jinan, capital of Shandong province, smart traffic signals have been installed on 344 intersections. The solutions have saved more than 30,000 hours of daily travel time for local residents, Didi announced. Cheng said he believes the company will embrace an intelligent, shared and new energy transportation future. \"In the next 10 to 20 years, transportation will transform into an integrated system that enables a central smart city brain to serve drivers, car owners, passengers as well as the entire city.\" Raymond Wang, a partner at Roland Berger China, said as smart transportation area does not currently have a clear profit model, Didi's investment in smart traffic was more about demonstrating its willingness to cooperate with the government. At the moment, the company provides a full range of app-based transportation options for over 450 million users nationwide, including taxis, express and premier options, car rental, enterprise-focused and bike-sharing services.

As the year draws to a close, let's look back at the biggest stories from 2017 and consider what they mean for China's future. The twice-a-decade National Congress of the Communist Party of China was held in October, laying out the blueprint for the country's development over the next five years and beyond. In the report delivered at the 19th CPC National Congress, General Secretary Xi Jinping said the principal contradiction facing China has evolved, as socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era. The principal contradiction the country now faces is one between unbalanced and inadequate development and the people's ever-growing needs for a better life. Previously, the principal contradiction was described as being between the ever-growing material and cultural needs of the people and backward social production. In the report, the CPC has also drawn up a two-stage development plan for the period from 2020 to the middle of the 21st century to transform China into a great, modern socialist country.,China launched its first cargo spacecraft in April on a mission to test technology designed for the nation's planned manned space station. The Tianzhou-1, China's first cargo spacecraft, docked with the orbiting Tiangong-2 space lab to supply fuel and other items. The mission allowed scientists to test in-orbit resupply technology, essential to running a manned space station. In the future, the Tianzhou series will be tasked with transporting supplies of fuel and other necessities to China's manned space station, construction of which is set to begin next year. With all the achievements China has made this year, we are confident the country will meet the target of building a moderately prosperous country by 2020 and move on to become a great modern socialist country by the middle of the 21st century. With that in mind, let's say goodbye to 2017 and get ready to embrace the new year.,As the opening chapter of China's first comprehensive civil code, the General Provisions of the Civil Law took effect Oct 1. The civil code, a dream of generations of Chinese legal professionals, is expected to better protect the property and personal rights and serve as an \"encyclopedia\" where people will be able to find answers if they encounter civil disputes. The civil code, scheduled to be introduced in 2020, would unify laws related to non-criminal and non-administrative areas of the legal framework under a single piece of legislation.,The First Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation was held in Beijing in May. As the highest-level meeting of its kind since the Belt and Road Initiative was proposed in 2013, the event attracted heads of state and government of 29 countries and representatives from 70 international organizations and 130 countries. At the forum, leaders pledged to build an open economy within the framework of the B&R Initiative and a list of more than 270 outcomes was formulated.

Called by President Xi a \"major historic and strategic decision\" that would be \"crucial for the millennium to come\", the move will help phase out functions from Beijing not directly related to the capital and explore a new model of optimized development in densely-populated areas.,This year marks the 90th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army. For the first time, a large-scale parade was staged as part of commemorations to mark the founding of the PLA. The parade was considered a review of the military reform Xi had masterminded and presided over since he assumed leadership of the CPC in 2012. Xi inaugurated reforms amid a high-profile anti-corruption campaign within the PLA in 2015. In the same year, he announced a 300,000-person cut in PLA troops and an implementation plan for command system reform. Since then, the PLA has made a profound change in structure and strategic thinking, getting closer to what Xi envisions as a leaner, more capable and world-class modern military.,China's high-speed rail network, the world's largest, has seen several important lines open this year, as well as the introduction of new-generation bullet trains.

{"content": "A senior Chinese negotiator will visit the United States at Washington's invitation late this month to resume trade talks, the Ministry of Commerce said on Thursday. It will be the first bilateral meeting since the Sino-US trade dispute escalated in June, attracting lots of attention and high expectations. On the invitation of the US, a delegation led by Wang Shouwen, vice-minister of commerce and China's deputy international trade representative, will meet with a team led by the US Treasury's Undersecretary for International Affairs David Malpass, the ministry said in a statement. The two sides will hold consultations on each other's concerns about Sino-US economic and trade issues, the ministry said. \"The Chinese side opposes unilateralism and trade protectionism practices and does not accept any unilateral trade restriction measures,\" said the statement. \"China welcomes dialogue and communication on the basis of reciprocity, equality and integrity.\" Beijing has retaliated after Washington slapped tariffs in goods since they held their last high-level meeting in June. The tension raised fears that their trade dispute will shake the global economy. It was unclear whether the talks will take place before or after Thursday, when Washington has said it will activate additional tariffs on $16 billion in Chinese goods. Beijing has said it will retaliate in kind.,At the last official round of talks in early June, US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross met with Vice-Premier Liu He in Beijing. Experts said Wang's visit to the US is expected to be helpful not only in reducing misunderstanding between the two governments but also in offering hope for progress in lessening the friction that has set global markets on edge. Li Yong, deputy director of the China Association of International Trade Expert Committee, said conducting the vice-ministerial level meeting means the two sides will talk about many specific issues, such as how to increase imports from each other's markets in different sectors and build a solid foundation for higher-level official meetings. \"As the bilateral trade friction has affected global value and supply chains, as well as many countries' financial markets, it is time for both sides to talk about what they can offer to temporarily avoid a global economic slowdown and an escalation of the trade war,\" he said. Makoto Sengoku, a market analyst at Tokai Tokyo Research Institute, told AFP: \"It is hard to tell how the talks will go, but it's a positive signal that the two countries are looking for some compromise plan. If they were determined to fight it out, they wouldn't meet.\" US trade policy toward China has been fairly self-contradictory, which reflects the gap of interests between different government branches, said Dong Yan, a senior researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. \"As you can see from the previous talks, the US Treasury Department still wanted a negotiated settlement because it sought a sustainable China-US economic relationship, while the Office of the US Trade Representative has been playing tougher with Chinese shipments,\" she said. Dong said there have been some impacts on the real economy in the United States as tariffs have been enacted in the past two months. This has caused opinion disparities among different government departments, multinational companies and business groups within the US, she said.", "overall-label": "business"}

That's a 92 percent drop compared to the same period in 2017, and the lowest level in seven years, according to a report released Wednesday by Rhodium Group, a US research firm which tracks Chinese direct investment in the US. Another survey carried out by China General Chamber of Commerce-USA showed that 44 percent of respondents see deterioration in China-US economic and trade relations in 2018. And the same proportion believe that a stable and healthy relationship between the two countries is extremely important to the success of their company's business in the US. The CGCC 2018 Annual Business Survey Report was released in Washington on Wednesday. Foreign direct investment from China to the United States declined 30 percent in 2017 compared to a record high in 2016, according to the CGCC report. \"It's clear that the US-China relationship is facing incremental challenges. And perhaps even roadblocks for further development and co-operation,\" said Xu Chen, chairman of the CGCC and president of Bank of China USA. Xu said that Chinese companies operating in the US have \"bought American-made products, created American jobs, benefited American communities and paid American taxes.\" It is the fifth consecutive year the CGCC has conducted its annual business survey on Chinese enterprises in the US. This year's survey was carried out in March 2018 and included a total of 249 responses, an increase of 17 percent over last year. \"In terms of the trade tensions, we haven't seen any real effect from that yet. Of course it's going to be a negative effect,\" said Daniel J. McQuade, group president of AECOM Construction Services. Respondents were especially concerned with high tariffs on imports (60 percent) and the prospect of tighter senior executive work visas and immigration policies (63 percent). Concerns are rising among Chinese executives in the US about the tone and temperament of relations between China, the US, and their respective companies. More than 40 percent of respondents expressed concern about accusations of intellectual property theft or cyber attacks, and 25 percent by the nativist \"Buy American, Hire American\" rhetoric. According to the survey, nearly 60 percent of respondents said the headcount of their workforce rose in 2017, despite the trade tensions. The same percentage expects to increase their workforce in the next two years \u00a1\u00aa with two-thirds anticipating an increase of at least 10 percent. Jeff Zhao, vice-president of BeijingWest Industries, said that recruiting talent was not easy for his company. Steve Tan, president of China Telecom Americas, said that hiring talent was not a problem for them. Looking to the future, 48 percent of respondents are optimistic about the US commercial environment over the next three years, and only 11 percent are pessimistic. \"I think it's going to be still like that for the next 6-12 months,\" said Shau Zhang, partner and market leader of Ernst & Young's Americas China Overseas Investment Network. \"We want Chinese investors in Kentucky,\" said Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin. \"We can not be an island unto ourselves here in America,\" Bevin added. \"We need each other.

{"content": "  Gearing up for four new events at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, China's top sports body is hoping to draft overseas athletes of Chinese origin to represent their motherland in areas where China lacks athletic prowess. Without enough talent in surfing, climbing, skateboarding and BMX freestyle riding, four sports added for the Tokyo Games, the General Administration of Sport of China has launched a progressive talent selection program to identify and develop athletes from home and abroad. The administration has formed a leading group with the four respective sporting bodies and Beijing Sport University to run the program, which opened an online registration system on Monday to receive applications from Chinese talent at home, foreign athletes of Chinese ancestry and Chinese citizens living abroad.   Online registration on the university's website will be open through Aug 31, followed by an audition and two rounds of qualification tests with a two-month training camp to eventually select 50 athletes for each of the sports by the end of this year. An international experts panel consisting of coaches, physical trainers, nutritionists and psychologists with expertise in the four sports, which are currently underdeveloped in China, will assess and guide the registrants.   The program will reach out to countries with strengths in such \"extreme sports\", such as the United States, Australia and Brazil, to search for established talent with Chinese origins. It would attract them to represent China with stipends and policies on nationality-transfer procedures if necessary, according to the leading group. \"Due to the lack of talent in these niche sports in China, it is the shortcut that we have to take to prepare for Tokyo in such a short period of time,\" said Cao Weidong, director of the leading group and Party chief of Beijing Sport University. \"The reform also is being implemented by overhauling the traditional athletic talent drafting system and by expanding it to the grassroots and extending its reach overseas.\" It intends to expand the nation's Olympic prowess beyond traditional strong sports including table tennis, badminton and diving. One example is the Chinese Ice Hockey Association organizing tryout camps in the Canadian cities of Toronto and Vancouver in June to select young players of Chinese ancestry to join the national program through naturalization for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.   \"To channel overseas talent to the national system, with support in policy and logistics, is an experiment of great significance to improve our relatively weak sports quickly,\" said Liu Xiaonong, director of the athletic department of sports administration. However, persuading some excellent overseas talent to abandon foreign citizenship to be eligible to represent China remains a challenge, given that China doesn't accept dual citizenship, observers said. \"Still, strong support within China's State-run sports system will appeal to a certain group of overseas Chinese who couldn't join the mainstream athletic systems in their adopted countries,\" said Zhang Bing, a sports sociology expert at Tsinghua University.", "overall-label": "politics"}

The leaders did not favor one bike-share brand though, forming a rainbow of colors with some on Mobikes, Ofos, and even a Phoenix bike made in Shanghai.

Han said then: \"I support shared bikes! I appreciate such an innovative initiative. The government should embrace the new creation.\" His public riding is a powerful footnote to this statement. Shared bikes have become very popular across China in less than half a year, becoming one of the most effective business measures to solve the \"the last mile\" problem of city traffic.  As shared bikes become increasingly popular in many cities, they have exposed a slew of problems like illegal parking, encroachment on public resources and poor pedestrian behavior.  Cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Tianjin have rolled out regulatory measures, giving active support and regulating the bike-sharing industry. The introduction of these policies sets standards and constraints, while also demonstrating support for the industry.

The Olympic Games definitely has given Beijing a face lift and the city looks totally different. I came back right on the verge of the Chinese Lunar New Year. The streets lined with red lanterns and trees strung with budding lights from root to tip; The Christmas holiday has definitely become both an economic venture and a welcome mat to many foreigners. Glowing Chinese characters, large and colored boldly mark the roof tops of high rises and glass sky scrapers. Beijing in the winter is known to be one of the coldest place and amazingly I have gotten adjusted to the cold very quickly that most times I never notice it. China is definitely pushing forward to make its mark on the world and to obtain the highest position it can achieve. With business on an all time height in the newest Economic Power there are many new opportunities.   Food in Beijing has exploded into a whole array of all you can eat. There is Thai food, Japanese food, Korean, Vietnamese, Moroccan, Italian, Tibetan, Persian, Pakistani, Persian, Italian, Indian, and Vietnamese. Food, food, food everywhere! Even Vegetarian places! There is food for days! I have certainly had a warm welcome, even by strangers I just met. There is much to see as Beijing is a large cultural hub in China and one can enjoy many tourist and local sites alike. My Mandarin language skills are developing rapidly in both written and oral and there is plenty of opportunity to use both. I enjoy meeting people from all over and it is important to me to build, network, learn and share with others. I have even made close Chinese friends and that means a lot to me.  In the past I noticed there were two experiences one could have here as a person of African descent and those two experiences seem to have grown along those lines. One is an experience in which black is exotic; where curiosity of blackness drives the interaction and or relations. You may be asked to pose for a photo with someone. Your hair and skin will spark ooos and ahhhs and drive some to reach out to touch or ask you how you made your hair like that. You may be bombarded with comments on how you are so beautiful, or so handsome, or black is so nice. In this case black is beautiful, black is exotic, black is erotic, black is cool, black is mysterious.  On the opposite end of the black experience in China is the Afrophobic experience where black is scary, dangerous, unintelligent, and poor. It seems that both experiences are fueled by perceptions and not enough genuine interaction and knowledge between the two groups of people. African Americans and Chinese have much to learn from each other and much to share with each other to foster cultural ties and economic business as well! Nowadays things are much more different and there you are rarely started at. There is no one rushing to touch my hair or anything like that. Progress is always good. 2012 is the year of the dragon and while things may not always seem clear. This is a year in which I see many great things will happen. Great culture, great experiences, and great business! I am inspired and would like to inspire other African Americans to expand economically by looking East.

Established in 2012, Xiaozhu is one of the first Chinese home-sharing platforms and has around 150,000 shared-house sources in 306 cities in China. \"We will provide about 80,000 homes for business trips in over 50 cities by the end of this year, starting from Shenzhen, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Chengdu,\" said the company's CEO Chen Chi. Rooms for business travelers, priced at 300 to 400 yuan ($44 to $58), are equipped with office supplies and an invoice is promised to be provided within 11 working days. Another new service designed for business travelers is monthly settlement and company accounts, but the company admitted it needs the support of a stronger IT system. When asked about the reason to start such a new product, Chen said \"last year, more than 15 percent of our users chose our service for business trips\". In 2015, business travelers accounted for 36.5 percent of overall home-sharing users, while half were individual tourists, according to a report by Beijing-based internet consultancy Analysys. Chen said the service initially targeted young employees in startups and SMEs, but some large enterprises have also showed an interest. So far, a dozen internet companies, maker spaces and co-working offices have signed cooperation agreements with Xiaozhu. As young people born in 1990s become the major part of the labor force and with the growth of startups, business trip demand is becoming more diversified and personalized, he said.

Beijing will establish a \"professional farmer\" system to lure talents, from rural workers to urban dwellers, to embark on agricultural-related businesses, said Han Changfu, minister of agriculture and rural affairs. \"We will accelerate the cultivation of new types of agricultural entities and bolster scalable agricultural operations,\" Han told a panel discussion during the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2018 on Monday. \"Meanwhile, we should guide, support and encourage a variety of talents to return or come to the countryside and start their own business,\" he said, adding that concrete measures are still underway. The strategy of rural vitalization was first proposed as one of the major aspects of developing a modernized economy and lifting its residents out of poverty by 2020. \"The ultimate goal is to make 'farming' an attractive and promising profession that is not placed at an inferior social ranking,\" Han said. To increase the allure of the countryside, China will strive to make the agricultural industry more efficient and competitive, by better integrating primary, secondary and tertiary industries and strengthening environmental protection. To narrow the rural-urban divide, the government will rebalance policies to prioritize the development of infrastructure building and the introduction of basic social services. The private sector has a role to play in boosting rural entrepreneurship. China's leading agribusiness company New Hope Group has budgeted 50 billion yuan ($7.9 billion) in five years to invest in a comprehensive network that produces, sells, and promotes high-quality agricultural produce, said its chairman Liu Yonghao. Over the same period, the company also plans to train over 200,000 farm owners and agricultural technicians to equip them with e-commerce and other technological knowhow to jumpstart and expand their businesses. \"Some rural areas are over-urbanized, with young and fit rural workers leaving village homes and towns for cities thanks to better pay,\" Liu said. \"By modernizing agricultural production, we want to turn 'farming' into a name tag that people are proud of,\" he said.

Wanrong mall will be occupied by finance and hi-tech firms, the government said.  Built in the 1980s, the sprawling zoo market is loved by locals and outsiders alike for its expansive selection of sartorial products, many at rock-bottom prices.

{"content": "When it opened in 2008, Beijing South Railway Station was hailed by observers as a shining example of a modern rail transportation hub. The 32-hectare, oval-shaped station, which handled China's first high-speed trains, has been compared with New York's Grand Central and London King's Cross stations. But its star, which was expected to continue rising, has been falling in the eyes of many. As the number of passengers has expanded rapidly over the past decade, leaving and arriving at Beijing South has become an ordeal. Long lines form for taxis at the station, with unauthorized, \"black\" cabs that overcharge also operating in the area. Overcrowding is common on the concourse. As one of three major rail hubs in the capital, Beijing South mainly handles passengers traveling to or from Tianjin and Shanghai and Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Fujian provinces. About 400 bullet trains operate from the station every day, and during the summer travel rush it handles an average of about 154,000 passengers a day. From July 1 to Aug 31, the station is expected to see 9.53 million travelers. But based on growing complaints, many passengers appear unhappy with the services provided. Shen Peilan, a frequent commuter between Beijing and Shanghai, said, \"Randomly ask around about the experience at Beijing South, and even the most reticent passenger will have a complaint.\" The situation worsens at night. Most of the 15 bus routes operating at the station do not run after 11 pm. By that time, the two subway lines at the station also have closed. About 10 trains arrive between 11pm and midnight, leaving as many as 10,000 passengers searching for taxis. They form a zigzag line waiting for cabs in a stuffy area of the station, and sometimes the line can stretch hundreds of meters. Those at the front cannot see the end. In summer, although the air conditioners are on, poor air circulation can make the humid, hot and suffocating taxi waiting area highly oppressive. One passenger, who gave his name only as Kuai, was one of those waiting on Monday after 11 pm. As a frequent bullet train traveler to Beijing, he often arrives at the station at night and said the long lines are a frequent occurrence. \"Sometimes the line will take several turns, which leaves me waiting for more than an hour,\" he said. He has tried booking hailed cars and taxis online in advance, but without a definite pickup point drivers usually have difficulty finding him. \"When cabs enter the station's underground garage, the navigation signal is poor and drivers may easily get lost,\" he said. Cab driver Zhang Ku backed up Kuai's story, saying the maze-like garage often bewilders drivers and passengers. Given the limited choice, Kuai uses illegal cabs outside the station. \"Some taxis and illegal cabs pick up customers along the street, usually displaying 'leaving instantly' signs to attract passengers,\" he said, adding that they also overcharge. A passenger surnamed Liu said he was approached by illegal cab drivers while waiting in line. \"The most insane price was 500 yuan ($73) to Xizhimen, (about 10 times higher than the metered fare),\" Liu said. He usually takes the subway from the station, but at night when the network closes his choice is limited. The station's name, Beijing South, has been used derisively as \"Beijing difficulty\" by netizens and the media, as the word \"south\" in Chinese is pronounced the same as the word \"difficulty\". Taxi driver Zhang said he seldom goes to the station even though he has been driving for more than 20 years. \"From 11 pm to midnight, taxis are in high demand on the streets. I do not need to go to the railway station,\" he said. A cabbie surnamed Du said the streets near Beijing South are always congested because illegal taxis park in the area.,Chen Yanyan, dean of Beijing University of Technology's metropolitan transportation college, said Beijing South has failed to run a successful transportation hub for the traveling and nontraveling public. \"To prioritize passengers' needs, the subway could close later and buses could be added at night,\" she said. She suggested that public transportation services should be increased at the station to ease the shortage of taxis during peak hours, and that operating hours be extended to help late arrivals. \"The authorities can also take advantage of information technology to dispatch taxis more efficiently,\" she added. The station's design has also failed to prioritize passengers' needs, Chen said. The layout of a well-operated station should first consider passengers instead of business. The station's failure to distinguish its commercial area from the passenger areas has worsened the problem, she said. At Beijing South, the waiting area is surrounded by stores on the same floor. \"Separating the two areas has been the norm for well-run stations across the globe, including Hongqiao station in Shanghai, King's Cross in London and Grand Central in New York,\" she said. Chen also said that in these stations, public transportation, including the subway and buses, instead of taxis or private cars, is the principal choice for travelers.,Yang Tao, a member of the China Urban Traffic Planning Institute Academic Committee, said the reasons for the difficulties being experienced at Beijing South are complicated. \"The Beijing South problem is not only a simple problem of transport, but a problem of social governance, which is a comprehensive reflection of beliefs, technology and the services of participating stakeholders at all levels, including the government and operating companies. To solve this problem, we need to examine the situation and propose comprehensive solutions, rather than simply encouraging more taxis to go there,\" Yang said. He added that problems arose because the station was built in an area with a poor surrounding road network, insufficient land and with uncompleted links for passengers to transfer to buses, the subway or cabs. Yang added that early-stage planning for the station had not been ideal, failing to foresee the increased passenger flow and had failed to provide sufficient public transportation connections. He suggested the authorities invite professional consultants specializing in transportation design to carry out a comprehensive assessment of the station and nearby areas. This should include traffic load, the road network, public transportation system, transfers and connections, as well as management at all levels. A proposal for improvements should be submitted after seeking opinions from experts and the public. \"We should pay more attention to whether the number of subway trains and buses, as well as the service, is adequate. If the (right number of) subway trains and buses are in place, then we can solve the problem of supply and demand at source. At the same time, reform of online car-hailing should continue. The most important thing is to identify the crux of the problem, not just solve a single problem,\" he said. Yang said public transportation systems in developed European countries and Japan have been successful, but it is unrealistic to merely duplicate foreign examples. \"Integrated transportation hubs in Japan and Europe can operate round-the-clock and offer convenient public transport facilities to fully guarantee demand is met. Smooth connections, easy transfers and clear signs at stations can minimize the need for taxis,\" he said. Yang said small cars, including taxis and private vehicles, should generally be avoided for travelers, given China's large population, limited land and road resources. \"On the other hand, we should take full advantage of developing public transport and encourage people to use it more,\" he said.,Liu Daizong, China transport program director at the World Resources Institute, said cooperation between different departments, including the railway company, Beijing Municipal Commission of Transport and public security departments, can easily tackle the problems at Beijing South. Liu said the lack of interdepartmental coordination has resulted in an increase in illegal cabs operating outside the station and long lines for taxis inside. \"Trains are managed by China Railway Co, buses and subways are managed by the Beijing Municipal Commission of Transport, whereas the crackdown on illegal taxis is carried out by local police and the government,\" he said. Liu added that when coordination is improved, transportation authorities can extend the operating hours of the subway network or buses to cope with delays, or add special lines outside operating hours to meet the demand from late arrivals. \"When there's an adequate supply of public transportation, the illegal taxis will die,\" he said, adding that the growing number of passengers had not caused the problem. \"For administrators, information such as a train's arrival and departure times and the number of passengers expected, are readily available,\" he said, adding that plans requiring joint efforts can be made accordingly. More than 250,000 people use New York's Grand Central Terminal every day, but it operates without problems, Liu said, adding that if properly managed, train stations should handle both arriving and departing passengers efficiently. \"In developed countries, train stations also generate huge amounts of revenue. Customer spending at King's Cross in London is even higher than that in many high streets,\" he said, adding that there is no problem in commercializing stations.,To tackle the problems at Beijing South, joint efforts are clearly needed. According to the Beijing Municipal Commission of Transport, one of the subway lines at the station, Line 4, will extend its operating hours to 12:10 am from Friday. This late-night service will operate on Fridays, Sundays and during holidays. The station has installed 14 air conditioners and glass fences at taxi-waiting zones, and is allowing more hailed cars and online booking for taxis after 9 pm to cater to demand. An LED screen has been installed to display real-time information about the taxi line, including estimated waiting time, Liang Zhaoyu, a spokesman for the station, said on Monday. The station will also install fans and renovate the roof in the taxi waiting area to make passengers more comfortable. The project will be completed by the end of this month. From Sunday, passengers will be able to order buses leaving from the station at night. The transportation authority will release nighttime train arrival information through Beijing Transport Radio and the taxi dispatch center, encouraging more taxi drivers to pick up passengers late at night. It will also encourage cab companies to send more taxis to the station. Transport, public security and other departments will make joint efforts to clear the nearby area and keep illegal taxis off the streets. On hearing news of the extended subway operating times at the station, Liu, from the World Resources Institute, praised the prompt efforts made by the government. Kuai, the passenger, said, \"People coming to Beijing, China's capital, for business and travel should find it convenient to get around.\" Shen, the commuter, said, \"Most outsiders get their first impression of the capital from Beijing South, which provides them with an image of the world's second-largest economy.\" Yang Zekun contributed to this story.", "overall-label": "politics"}

The Beijing-based Wanda Sports Group holds shares in Infront Sports & Media and the Ironman long-distance triathlon brand, among other top global assets. It filed an application on Friday and aims to raise $500 million through its IPO on the Nasdaq. It will use some of the proceeds to repay loans related to group restructuring, according to its prospectus. As one of the largest sport events and marketing platforms, Wanda Sports posted sales revenue of 1.12 billion euros ($1.23 billion) in 2018, and a profit of 54 million euros. For the three months ended March 31, 2019, the company reported revenue of 245.6 million euros and a loss of 8.6 million euros, the company said in its filing. Since 2015, the giant property developer has been diversifying its portfolio in sports, in addition to film and hotel businesses, by completing a group of high-profile acquisitions of world-class sports assets. It is now a top event organizer in triathlon, mountain biking and running events, the filing said. \"The sports industry is a sunrise industry in China, and despite some challenges, the investment in the sector has been growing. Now, it is a very good timing to strengthen the layout in the sports sector, fueled by the growing demand of Chinese consumers increasingly paying attention to exercising and keeping healthy,\" said An Fuxiu, founder of Sportbank, a Beijing-based sports industry consultancy. \"Wanda Sports has helped many global events to launch in China, such as the Ironman race. The group could become more internationalized by potentially listing its sports assets. Sports is a good path that will help Chinese enterprises and brands to become major players in the global market,\" she said. Chinese billionaire Wang Jianlin, chairman of Wanda Group, said in 2016 the sports industry will be a new growth point in the next decade in the country. Wanda Sports aims to go public ultimately and become the first sports company with annual sales revenues of over $10 billion globally. In 2015, Wanda completed a $650 million merger with World Triathlon Corp. Later, it bought Swiss sports marketing group Infront Sports& Media for 1.05 billion euros. The global sports media and events market is projected to grow to 224 billion euros in 2022 from 179 billion euros in 2018, representing a compound annual growth rate of about 5.9 percent, the prospectus said.", "overall-label": "business"}

{"content": "Last month, I was assigned to Kongpo'gyada county, Tibet autonomous region, on a two-day medical assistance program. It was the first time I had traveled to Tibet as a volunteer doctor, but it was easy to identify the most common illnesses just by observing people. The so-called plateau redness - the Tibetans' rosy cheeks - could indicate thickening of the heart muscles as a result of long exposure to low levels of oxygen. Also, I frequently saw adults wobble slightly while walking, as if shifting their center of weight from one side to the other, which suggested severe pelvic arthritis. After working at the county-level hospital for two days, I realized that the gap in the healthcare sector is still quite large between Kongpo'gyada and Beijing, where I work most of the time For instance, the county-level hospital only has 30 beds to accommodate all types of patients, but at my hospital in Beijing, every department has about 40 beds. Another concern is poor health awareness. A large number of patients were unwilling to take medical tests, or they bought medication they knew little about, in an attempt to avoid hassle as much as possible. My field of expertise is kidney disease, and during the two day visit, I saw five people who had kidney stones. Though their conditions were critical, they came with a simple purpose; to obtain analgesics so they wouldn't feel any pain. Given the current situation, I believe that campaigns to promote health awareness are extremely important. The most effective way would be to launch educational campaigns or talks in smaller towns and villages that are out of touch with modern medical networks. Equally important is that more of the region's grassroots medical workers should be sent to Beijing for training. Ultimately, local medics are a sustainable, driving force that could forge Tibet's fragmented medical services into a complete network in the long run.", "overall-label": "politics"}
{"content": "The World Winter Sports Expo will highlight exchanges in Olympic legacies and promoting mass participation at its third assembly in Beijing next month. From skiing simulators that offer immersive experiences on dry surfaces to high-tech winter sports gear and resort tours through VR goggles, the third edition of the international exposition will thrill visitors with the newest winter sports equipment, services and events from Sept 19 to 22 at the China National Convention Center, organizers said on Tuesday. The expo, which was launched in 2016, one year after Beijing won the bid for the 2022 Winter Olympic Games, will focus on enlightening the host in key areas, such as the post-Olympics operation of facilities and promotion of mass winter sports participation this year through exhibits, presentations and brainstorming forums featuring international experts. \"The expo has built a bridge between China and international winter sports powers for us to facilitate preparations for the 2022 Olympics and to boost development of the winter sports sector through extensive exchanges,\" said Gao Yunchao, deputy secretary-general of the Beijing Olympic City Development Association. The association, established after the 2008 Summer Olympics, has been organizing the expo with partner International Data Group since 2016. This year's event is expected to attract 500 brands, 24,000 exhibitors and 150,000 visitors, and will occupy 30,000 square meters. Highlighting the expo's forum session, a panel discussion with the mayors of 10 previous Olympics host cities will shed light on legacy and sustainability plans that Beijing could adopt to benefit its own post-Games operations. \"As a newcomer to winter sports, China is in desperate need of proven experience and expertise in developing winter sports sustainably beyond 2022,\" Gao said. \"I am sure the mayors' discussion will give us a lot of insights.\" Some high-profile guests, including Juan Antonio Samaranch, a vice-president of the International Olympic Committee; International Ski Federation President Gian-Franco Kasper; and Karl Stoss, president of the Austrian Olympic Committee, will also share their understanding of Beijing's organization for the 2022 Olympics, China's winter sports prospects and business opportunities during the expo. Since winning the Winter Olympics bid, China has rolled out a national program involving 300 million people in winter sports activities leading up to 2022, drawing attention from international powers in the field. Austria, a snow sports power and a country of honor at the expo, is keen on helping China address winter sports development, especially in the operation of ski resorts, said Martin Glatz, commercial counselor at the Austrian embassy in Beijing. \"Of course the 2022 Olympics will give the whole winter sports sector in China a boost,\" Glatz told China Daily on Tuesday. \"The challenge will be not only developing the professionals but also making skiing popular with the public, so that the slopes and facilities built for the Olympics can be used by consumers after 2022.\" Under Beijing's plan, all skiing events of the 2022 Winter Olympics will be held at newly built and existing mountain resorts in northwest Beijing's Yanqing district and co-host city Zhangjiakou in Hebei province. Post-Olympics use of the facilities has been considered in construction and upgrade projects, according to the Beijing 2022 organizing committee. Diversifying the business and service offerings of Olympic resorts for yearlong operation is also critical, Glatz added. \"Don't just build resorts for winter but for all four seasons. Make sure you can also use the resorts and all the infrastructure with it during the rest of the year.\"", "overall-label": "life-style"}

{"content": "    A program for young Sinologists is helping academics from all over the world gain a deeper understanding of the country. Xu Lin reports. At a workshop in Jingdezhen, Jiangxi province, Polina Tsoncheva is carefully pinching clay on a spinning potter's wheel, molding it into a plate. \"It's such an indelible memory! The city is world-famous for its pottery and ceramics, and I get to see the process of how Chinese craftsmen make them,\" says the assistant professor who teaches Chinese and translation at St. Cyril and St. Methodius University of Veliko Tarnovo, in Bulgaria. Tsoncheva was on a four-day field trip to Jiangxi's Jingdezhen, Wuyuan and Sanqing Mountain as part of a cultural experience. They visited old villages, ancient porcelain kiln sites and watched traditional operas. It was part of the recent three-week 2017 Visiting Program for Young Sinologists in Beijing, in which 27 Sinologists from 26 countries participated. With an average age of 36, their research fields include the Chinese language, history and politics. The Ministry of Culture and the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences co-founded the annual project in Beijing in 2014. This year, it was held in four cities\u00a3\u00adBeijing, Shanghai, Xi'an and Zhengzhou\u00a3\u00adwith a total of 120 participants. \"Young Sinologists can not only enhance their academic level, but also explore Chinese culture and society,\" says Zhu Qi, deputy director of the international liaison department of the Ministry of Culture. \"It was the most wonderful three weeks, at least in my last 10 years,\" says Tsoncheva. \"After listening to the lectures given by Chinese scholars in Beijing, interesting ideas for my future research have come to my mind.\" She wants to delve into the history of Tongwen Guan, or the School of Combined Learning. Founded in the late Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), the government school taught foreign languages and scientific subjects. In 1902, it was merged with the Imperial University of Peking, which is now Peking University. \"The school was established due to the demands of translators and interpreters. Studying foreign languages allows one to meet different people and learn about the culture, history and traditions of other countries,\" she says. She also wants to further her study tracing the earliest time when Chinese literature entered Bulgaria and how it influenced Bulgarian literature. She discovered that in the 19th century, poems by Tang Dynasty (618-907) poets, such as Li Bai and Du Fu, were translated into Bulgarian from Russian or German versions. \"They didn't know Chinese, but their translations capture the Chinese spirit,\" she says.,Many years ago, Bulgarians knew little about China and they had limited access to information about the country. Tsoncheva's parents, who were born in the middle of 20th century, never visited China but they have been interested in Chinese culture and read books about China. She recalls that when she first heard a Bulgarian speaking Chinese in university, it sounded different from any other language she had heard before. \"It was like a song. I liked it at once and from that time on I was determined to speak it at least as good as that,\" she says. After studying Chinese in Bulgaria for four years, she came to the Beijing Language and Culture University in 2001 for a one-year program to further her Chinese. \"China is changing rapidly. Thanks to globalization, we're learning from each other's cultures in a dynamic process that also changes us,\" she says. \"I'm trying to transfer my endless curiosity and love for China and the Chinese language to all my students, making them eager to learn more and expand their worldview.\" Ana Jovanovic couldn't agree more. \"Every time I come to China, I see a lot of changes because China has made developments in every field,\" says Jovanovic, docent at the faculty of philology, University of Belgrade, Serbia. \"Many foreigners are interested in traditional Chinese art and music. In Serbia, there are more performances today by Chinese performers and music troupes (than years before). It's great to see these shows outside of China.\" Jiangxi boasts various traditional operas, and during her stay in the province, she enjoyed an opera about the legend of the White Snake\u00a3\u00ada love story between a man and the spirit of a snake. \"It's amazing for us to see the local operas and know about the local culture via the field trip to villages,\" says Jovanovic, who has translated two books by Nobel Prize laureate Mo Yan into Serbian. According to her, from the 1950s to 1970s, Chinese novels, including works of Lu Xun (1881-1936), were translated from intermediate languages such as English and French. But starting from the 1980s, some Chinese novels were translated directly from Chinese.,Svetlana Kharchenkova, a lecturer from the Leiden University Institute for Area Studies, in the Netherlands, believes the Visiting Program for Young Sinologists is an excellent program for young scholars and PhD students. \"It's an intensive program with varied activities. It's important to interact with Chinese scholars who are in similar research areas. For example, we can read and discuss each other's work to develop further research,\" she says. She is now writing a book about the development of the contemporary Chinese art market. \"The market didn't exist about 30 years ago, but now it's flourishing. I'm interested in these questions\u00a3\u00adhow the market and the institutions were established? How did the auction houses and galleries emerge?\" she says. The visit to Jingdezhen also gave her inspiration, as she visited the art zone and porcelain studios there. She also enjoyed climbing the Sanqing Mountain, because the picturesque views reminded her of the traditional Chinese painting about landscapes. \"Imagine if we lived here, we would have the inspiration to make beautiful artworks, too. No wonder China has such wonderful traditional culture,\" she says. She started to learn the Chinese language in 2000. Four years later, she made her first visit to China, studying Chinese at Peking University for a year. \"The internet was not so developed at that time. It was so much fun to meet Chinese people and see Chinese characters everywhere,\" she recalls. She worked in Beijing from 2006 to 2008, witnessing the fast development of the capital before the Olympic Games, such as the further construction of the subway and the Beijing National Stadium.,\"The program allows China to market itself. It's like a melting pot of different cultures. Young Sinologists from all over the world come to see what's going on here, rather than read textbooks about it,\" says Tochukwu Innocent Okeke, a lecturer from the department of history and diplomatic studies at the University of Abuja, Nigeria. Like others, he appreciates the opportunity to interact with Chinese scholars, so they can get firsthand information about China. \"It helps me open my heart more so I can connect with China in a more profound way,\" he says. \"I'm happy about being able to read books in the library of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences because outside China it's not easy to find such a rich collection. I also met many professors and our talks have given me more insights about my research focus.\" When he was pursuing his PhD several years ago in Wuhan, Hubei province, he found the history of China-Africa relations could be traced back at least to the early Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), when Emperor Yongle sent his admiral Zheng He on seven expeditions to the Indian and Pacific oceans. \"Now the visiting program has stirred my interest in the topic again. I want to know about the ancient relationship between China and Africa, especially during the Ming Dynasty. I want to know about Zheng's statecraft and diplomacy,\" he says. Like him, other young Sinologists also benefited greatly from talking to Chinese scholars. \"Chinese professors give me precious suggestions about my research on agriculture. I want to figure out what lessons African countries can learn from China. One of the challenges between China and Africa is that there is little research in the area,\" says Gedion Jalata from Ethiopia, the program manager for Africa-China Dialogue Platform at Oxfam International. \"Since reform and opening-up was launched in 1978, China has lifted more than 700 million people out of poverty. We're planning to have scholars and policymakers discuss this at our dialogue platform, so African countries can learn from China's experience to reduce poverty,\" he says.

For example, 16.6 percent of all males surveyed\u00a3\u00adboth smokers and nonsmokers\u00a3\u00adhad abnormal semen, including a lower concentration of sperm. But abnormalities were found in 32 percent those who smoked, according to the survey, which was released on Thursday. The chances of having a deformed fetus for nonsmoking males was 1.1 percent, but was 2.5 percent for smokers, the survey found. The survey covered 4,364 male patients seeking fertility treatment at 25 hospitals and clinics in 16 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities, including Beijing, Shanghai and Guangdong province. It was launched by the China Sexology Association and conducted by Peking University Third Hospital from August to October. Of the males surveyed, 99 percent were between 20 and 50 years old, with 51 percent who were smokers. Most of the smokers\u00a3\u00ad60 percent\u00a3\u00adhad been smoking for more than five years. \"The result of the survey shows that the damage from tobacco to male reproductive health is more serious than we expected,\" said Jiang Hui, director of the Andrology Department at Peking University Third Hospital in Beijing. Smokers' sperm is more likely to have abnormalities such as lower numbers and activity, as well as more deformities, he said. These may have resulted from the harmful chemicals in tobacco, such as nicotine, that damage human cells, he said. China is the world's biggest producer and consumer of tobacco, with more than 300 million smokers, most of them male. The survey also found that while more than 86 percent of the males understood that smoking causes lung diseases, only 43 percent of them were aware that it can also damage reproductive health. Liang Lirong, director of Beijing Chaoyang Hospital's smoking-cessation clinic, said quitting smoking is necessary to protect health, but most smokers in China try to quit smoking by willpower alone, which has a low chance of success. \"Many smokers fail to quit smoking because they did not find the right way,\" she said. \"We suggest addicted smokers try to use proper drugs with the advice of doctors to improve their chances of success.\"", "overall-label": "life-style"}

About two decades ago, when Ban Zan was a student at the Central Academy of Drama, one of his favorite playwrights was Ding Xilin (1893-1974). The renowned playwright's major works were written between 1923 and 1940 and concentrate on comedy. \"I was amused by the humorous dialogue, which is witty and implicit. That unique way of being humorous, I believe, belongs to the Chinese people,\" says the 40-year-old actor-turned-director Ban, who joined Beijing People's Art Theatre after he graduated in 2003. Since then, Ban has played roles in plays, such as  and  In 2016, Ban, who also has starred in movies and TV dramas, chose three one-act comedies by the playwright and adapted then into a play. The work, entitled  which premiered in Beijing in April 2016, tells three stories\u00a3\u00ad and  In the play, three actors from Beijing People's Art Theatre perform nine roles.,Now, after touring the country for the past two years, the play returns to Beijing and is being staged at the Beijing People's Art Theatre through Aug 6. \"The three comedies by Ding showcase different stages of romance: young lovers, newlyweds and elderly couples,\" says Ban, who made his directorial debut in 2015. \"I have been married for nearly eight years, and when I read the three comedies with my wife, we both relate to them and want to share them with the audience. \"Ding's comedies are easy to understand and the plots are simple. So, watching his comedies, you get a wonderful taste that lingers,\" says Ban. Ding, who was born in Taixing, in Jiangsu province, graduated from the University of Birmingham, in the United Kingdom, with a master's degree in physics. During his stay in the UK, Ding became interested in theater and started writing plays. In 1919, after returning to China, Ding taught physics at Peking University, and from 1924 to 1926, he was the dean of the physics department there.,As a playwright, Ding published 10 works.

Nationals from 53 countries with eligible travel identification and reserved tickets with a fixed date to a third country or region within 144 hours are eligible for the new visa-free entry period. They include the United States, Australia and the Republic of Korea. \"The new policy extends the visa-free stay for travelers who want to visit the three regions, allowing foreigners sufficient time for a short visit for travel, business meetings or visiting friends and family. It will boost the tourism industry,\" said Zhu Lei, deputy head of Beijing's port of entry office. Beijing and Tianjin previously allowed a 72-hour visafree stay. The 72-hour stay has been allowed by Beijing since 2013.,\"The number of foreigners eligible for the free-visa policy has increased gradually,\" Zhu said. \"The policy has been praised by international travelers. But based on a survey, about 40 percent of international travelers said 72 hours is insufficient for them to enjoy the city of Beijing, and they wished to extend their stay,\" Zhu said. In 2016, the 72-hour stay in Beijing was used on 26,323 passenger trips, an increase of 32 percent from 2015.

{"content": "    President Xi Jinping described the ups and downs of China-US ties by saying, \"A rainbow appears after winds and tides\", and added the two sides should treat each other with sincerity and kindness, have closer contacts and properly tackle disagreements.  Xi made the comments on Thursday in a meeting with US Marine General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff. Dunford, who arrived in Beijing on Monday night, is the first US senior military official to visit China since US President Donald Trump took office in January. Xi told Dunford that the world's two largest economies have major influence regionally and globally, and they bear key duties to secure world peace and stability and promote global development and prosperity. A good handle of the developing ties matters to both peoples and has profound influence on the global strategic picture, he said. Xi asked Dunford to relay his greeting to Trump, and said he welcomes Trump's visit to China, expected before this year ends. Speaking of the relations between the two militaries, Xi said such a tie is a key part of and key stabilizing factor for China-US relations, and the militaries have made progress in dialogue, building trust and cooperation.  Dunford said that under the navigation of President Xi and President Trump, the military relationship between the two has scored a number of advances as it has matured. Washington is committed to frank and professional dialogue with China regarding military affairs, expanding the scope of their exchanges and cooperation and managing and controlling risks, he said. Dunford's visit to China came amid tensions regarding the Korean Peninsula, and the situation there was a key item of his agenda. In a meeting earlier on Thursday, Vice-Chairman Fan Changlong of China's Central Military Commission told Dunford that China believes dialogue and reconciliation offer the only viable path toward resolving the peninsula's issues, and \"military means should not be an option\". All parties concerned should exercise restraint and avoid worsening tensions, Fan said. Beijing is ready to work with Washington in jointly playing positive roles to tackle the issues, Fan added.  Media reports noted that Dunford has said that Beijing should step up pressure on Pyongyang over the issue. In response, Foreign Ministry spokeswomen Hua Chunying said on Thursday that China's consistent stance on the issue will not change. \"It is no use to mislead or pressure (China), not to mention threatening (China)\" in this regard, Hua said.  China takes an objective and fair view when drafting the relevant policies, and Beijing is willing to maintain communication with Washington on the base of mutual respect, she added.

{"content": "Beijing will implement mandatory trash sorting rules in public spaces such as schools, hospitals and business areas, in a move to further encourage citizens to participate in garbage classification, a senior city official said on Wednesday. Resident credit accounts, including how people sort their domestic trash in their daily lives, are also set to be established so that some violations will be recorded in occupants' accounts, Zhang Jiaming, deputy mayor of Beijing, said in a report submitted to the Standing Committee of the Beijing Municipal People's Congress on Wednesday. \"We will set up a mechanism that garbage trucks can refuse to transfer trash if it is not classified.\" Real-time supervision of all kinds of garbage in the city will begin soon to drive the classification, he said. Beijing has carried out trash sorting since early 1998 when Dachengxiang community in Xicheng district became the first neighborhood to classify garbage. At the end of 2011, the city published China's first domestic waste management regulation, which took effect on March 1, 2012. However, the implementation of trash sorting in Beijing hasn't gone well in the past decade, since mere encouragement is not enough for citizens to change their habits, said Hao Zhilan, director of the urban construction and environmental protection committee at the Beijing's People Congress. The previous regulations didn't give specific fines for households, companies or institutions that fail to sort their garbage properly. \"Mandatory trash sorting is thus necessary for people, and revising the rules is also urgent in order to specify that garbage classification is a duty for waste producers,\" she said. A survey conducted by the standing committee of the municipal people's congress in April showed that only 20 percent of those sampled can accurately discard kitchen waste in trash bins. The survey was based on 3,071 people in 16 downtown and suburban districts of Beijing who lived in the areas for more than half a year. The survey showed that residents' unwillingness to participate in garbage classification is due to a lack of trash sorting facilities in communities and the irregular garbage transfer by trucks. Hao also suggested establishing a report-reward mechanism on mixed garbage transport activities and including trash sorting on an individual's credit record. Disciplinary measures should be administered to violators. She added that some specific measures should be taken to reduce the waste produced by the express delivery industry and to recycle packaging. In 2017, the Beijing municipal government released a waste disposal action plan specifying the four categories for sorting household trash: dry garbage, kitchen waste, recyclables and hazardous waste. It also aimed to have trash sorting reach 90 percent of the city by 2022. Some projects based on the resources from garbage recycling in Beijing's suburbs will be completed by the end of this year, along with the establishment of trash sorting demonstration areas in the capital.", "overall-label": "politics"}

{"content": "Beijing's top Party official said the city will help people affected by a sweeping safety campaign in the wake of a deadly fire with jobs and lodging. The fire in the city's Daxing district broke out in a building with over 400 residents in the village of Xinjian in Xihongmen township on Nov 18. Nineteen people were killed and eight injured. After the fire, the city government launched a 40-day citywide campaign aimed primarily at eliminating fire hazards and other safety problems in crowded apartments and warehouses that serve as storage areas, workshops or worker living space. Cai Qi, Party chief of Beijing, said in a Monday meeting that removing all fire hazards takes time and cannot be accomplished within a short period, Beijing Daily reported. He also said it is necessary to draft a three-year plan to fundamentally solve the problem. Cai visited the site of the accident three times in recent days, Beijing Daily said. Calling the accident a \"lesson paid with blood\", he said it is imperative to carry out a campaign to root out safety hazards. He also visited surrounding companies that were affected, asking them about how workers were resettled. While speaking with local officials in Xihongmen, Cai urged them to care for people affected and try their best to arrange new jobs and places to stay. Cai urged officials to carry out the campaign with more \"patience and humanistic care\" and \"better methods\". On Monday, a job fair was held in Xihongmen to offer opportunities to people who lost their jobs when their employers were told to shut down unsafe factories or warehouses. Human resources departments will organize more job fairs in Xihongmen to help workers in the area to find new jobs, he said. Also on Monday, Beijing police announced that the fire was caused by an electrical fault, ruling out arson. Twenty people suspected of having liability for the conditions that led to the fire have been detained, they said. The two-and three-story building with a basement housed workshops and living spaces and was rife with safety hazards, officials say. A person identified only by the surname Fan began building the structure in 2002. Fan began installing a refrigeration facility in the basement in March, and it was undergoing testing. The blaze was traced to a faulty wire in a wall built with flammable material. Fan was among those detained, police said. At Monday's fair, over 508 vacancies including driver, guard and cleaner were offered by 27 companies, the township government said. Many warehouses in Xihongmen failed fire and safety assessments and were closed. The fairs are mainly for those who became unemployed as a result, said Chen Yongqiang, deputy head of the township. \"For migrant workers who have decided not to work in Beijing anymore, we will provide temporary accommodation and train or bus tickets to go home,\" Chen said. \"We prefer the employers taking part in the job fair provide accommodation for employees,\" said Li Hualong, deputy head of the Daxing district human resource and social security bureau. Zhao Chuanxin, 28, who had worked and lived in a small clothing workshop in Xinjian where the fire happened, found a job at the fair. He will start working as a driver soon with meals and accommodation provided. Contact the writers at jiangchenglong@chinadaily.com.cn  ", "overall-label": "politics"}

Xi made the remarks during his visit to Zhangjiakou, Hebei province, Beijing's co-host city for the 2022 Games, to listen to a briefing on preparatory work and inspect proposed venue areas around Chongli county.  The president stressed that the organizing committee and involved departments should approach the preparation based on scientific planning in venue design, construction and resource allocation to host a green, open-minded and corruption-free Olympics in a shared manner.  \"There should be clear positioning of this region for future development. Rather than developing into a large-scale comprehensive metropolitan area, Chongli should be built into a ski destination with a strong local character,\" Xi said.  \"The post-Olympics operation of the facilities should be considered beforehand, given that many Olympic host cities face challenges with venues left unused after the event,\" he added.  Beijing, host of the 2008 Summer Olympics, and Zhangjiakou were picked in 2015 to host the 2022 Winter Olympics. Beijing will be the first city to hold both Summer and Winter Games.  During his visit to Genting Ski Resort in Chongli, the proposed venue for snowboarding and freestyle skiing in 2022, Xi received a warm ovation from regular skiers and athletes of China's national freestyle skiing team, who are training at the resort.  Public participation in and the athletic level of winter sports in China remain relatively low, but the 2022 Games will provide the perfect opportunity to boost the sector within five years, Xi said.  Xi also visited the resort's equipment rental area before going outdoors to check venue layouts around the resort.  China is rolling out a national plan inspired by Xi to encourage 300 million people to participate in winter sports and related activities by 2022. Governmental support for developing winter sports has earned positive comments from Thomas Bach, president of the International Olympic Committee. Bach said that after meeting Xi in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Jan 18, he feels certain China will be a success in hosting the Games.  \"It's obvious that the central government has high expectations in promoting winter sports ... as a new driver for economic growth, while encouraging the public to participate more in sports in general for a healthier nation,\" said Lin Xianpeng, a sports industry researcher from Beijing Sport University.", "overall-label": "politics"}

{"content": "Beijing prosecutors are working with the municipal government and education institutes to set up a system to better protect children against abuse.  The city's procuratorate signed a framework agreement on Wednesday with several departments and agencies, including those responsible for schools, civil affairs and social security, to create a network to identify minors at risk.  \"The system will help us spot clues as well as send advice on juvenile protection to schools and administrations,\" said Zhen Zhen, the deputy chief procurator. \"We also hope departments will provide feedback and share information about juvenile cases through the system.\"  She added that the system will also be used to increase children's awareness of how to protect themselves.  News of the system came as the Beijing People's Procuratorate reported that courts citywide had handled 1,108 criminal cases that involved children age 17 or under between 2014 and 2016. The children had been injured or sexually assaulted by an adult.  \"Cases in which adults harmed a juvenile have risen rapidly in the past three years,\" said Yue Huiqing, director of the procuratorate's juvenile crime department, which handles crimes committed by or against juveniles.  Abuse of a child accounts for about the two-thirds of the department's cases, \"and the number is going up, with most offenses being sexual assaults\", she said.  Some 1,255 offenders received \"strict punishments\" over the three years, Yue said. However, she added: \"Child victims have little awareness of self-protection and are sometimes afraid to tell their parents after they are assaulted, which makes it difficult for us to investigate and collect evidence.\"  She said many sexual assaults of children were perpetrated by someone familiar to the victim, and that the age of minor victims is becoming younger.  In May last year, a 63-year-old man surnamed Li, who was responsible for facility management in a community, was sentenced to one year in jail for sexual assault by Beijing No 2 Intermediate People's Court.  Li found that the parents of a 5-year-old girl had gone to work and left her alone playing in the community. So he took her to his rental house and sexually assaulted her, the court said.  In another case, a man surnamed Wu, a native of Hebei province, forced his niece, who was less than 12 years old, to have sex with him when he lived in her home in 2014, according to a statement from Beijing Miyun District People's Court.

{"content": "  Performers of shadow play, Peking Opera and acrobatics are displaying their skills at the Traditional Culture & Arts Week in Beijing. Chen Nan reports. Lu Baogang can still remember the day his father died of a heart attack in 1979. For Lu, who was 15 then, it felt like sky was falling. That year, as the youngest and only son of his family, Lu dropped out of school and started working with the Beijing Shadow Show Troupe, where his father was appointed as director days before he died. \"My mother made the decision for me and I had to obey because I had to earn money to support my family,\" says Lu, who has four elder sisters. He was a top student in his class and his dream was to study in university and become a teacher after graduation. Standing in his office at the Beijing Shadow Show Troupe, which is based in a quiet and hidden hutong (alleyway) in the capital's Xicheng district, Lu, 53, who is now the director of the troupe, recalls the events like they happened yesterday. The art his father practiced was shadow play, also known as shadow puppetry, an ancient Chinese art form combining music, storytelling and puppets. The art, which took shape in the Western Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 24), reached its peak in the Tang (618-907) and Song (960-1279) dynasties. The troupe celebrates its 60th anniversary this year. And during the ongoing Traditional Culture & Arts Week, which kicked off on Oct 31 and runs through Nov 17, Lu is leading his troupe to display his family's craft. There were, at one time, two schools of shadow puppetry in Beijing: eastern and western. Although they originated from the same source, they were different when it came to performing styles. Lu is the fifth generation to follow his family's shadow play tradition, whose style is from the old western school.,  The Beijing Shadow Show Troupe, set up by the government in 1957, is an extension of the Lu family tradition. Since its founding, the troupe has received support from established Peking Opera masters, including Mei Lanfang, who had invited the troupe to perform at his home many times. \"Shadow play and Peking Opera have a strong connection. Many repertoires, including The Journey to the West and White Snake Lady, were shared by shadow play and Peking Opera,\" says Lu. Like many traditional Chinese art forms, such as Peking Opera, shadow play has gone through rocky times, challenged by diverse contemporary entertainment. In 2008, shadow play was listed as a national intangible cultural heritage. What Lu wants to do is more than display this art form. \"I want to revitalize this art form. I am proud of my family's tradition. But for decades, the troupe was losing talent and its market was declining. It would be a shame if this art form dies in my hands,\" says Lu. The troupe now has 11 actors, from their early 20s to their 50s, who give about 110 performances every year around the country. They also produce shadow puppet cartoons for television and do free shows to children during the summer vacation. For now, Lu is preparing for a new show to be premiered in 2018, which will integrate traditional shadow play with contemporary elements, like a multimedia stage set, to attract younger audiences. But he feels that there is much to be done. He says that by letting more people see the art form\u00a3\u00adfrom the performances to the techniques of making shadow puppets\u00a3\u00adpeople, especially the young, could be inspired by what they see and begin their own revival. Along with Lu's troupe, the ongoing Traditional Culture& Arts Week also features Beijing Fenglei Peking Opera Company, which celebrates its 80th anniversary; and the Beijing Acrobatic Troupe, which marks 60 years.,The two troupes are also performing their latest works at the festival. The Beijing Fenglei Peking Opera Company was on the verge of dying in 2001, but had a dramatic reversal of fortune thanks to Song Yan, now 53, a Peking Opera actor, who is also the director of the company. When Song became the director, he led the actors to give nearly 800 performances in 15 months, which helped it survive. Today, 16 years later, the company is one of the best-known Peking Opera companies in the country, doing about 600 shows a year. The company premiered its work, Ke Si Jian Yi, at the Tianqiao Performing Arts Center on Nov 1 and 2, which is about the people who rented costumes to Peking Opera troupes in the 1930s. The show is the second of a trilogy by Song, in which he combines theater with Peking Opera. The first show, titled Wang Zi, premiered in October 2015. It tells the story of a father and his adopted son in Beijing in the 1930s. Speaking about the challenges traditional art forms are facing, Song, who joined the troupe when he was 12, says: \"Though they are different, there is one thing in common. People who learn these arts have to be patient and focused. You have to isolate yourself from the outside world, which is full of commercial benefits and a variety of entertainments. It takes years and even decades to master these techniques. That's why these arts are timeless and can still be appreciated by audiences centuries later.\" The Beijing Acrobatic Troupe will present a show, which won a gold medal at the Paris' Festival Mondial du Cirque de Demain (The World Festival of the Circus of Tomorrow) in 1995. Beijing Tianqiao Zenith Investment Group Co Ltd, which manages the three troupes, says they did more than 1,400 shows in 2016, which attracted more than 400,000 people. And in another bit of good news, the government of Xicheng district has received approval for a project to build a heritage center in the Tianqiao area, once a haven for folk arts and small businesses in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, to promote shadow puppetry and acrobatics. Xu Li, the deputy head of Xicheng district, says: \"These troupes are national treasures, and they have performed in other countries in cultural exchange programs, introducing Chinese culture to international audiences.\" The Traditional Culture & Arts Week is running through Nov 17, featuring performances and exhibitions at Tianqiao Performing Arts Center. 9 Tianqiao Nandajie, Xicheng district, Beijing. 400-635-3355.

{"content": "The Beijing municipal government is taking efforts to build a safe, convenient, efficient, green and economic transportation system.  Attaching great importance to solving traffic jams, the capital aims to improve citizens' satisfaction, according to Zhou Zhengyu, the director of the Beijing Municipal Commission of Transport.  Beijing has introduced controls on its population size, transferred some function of capital, optimized the jobhousing balance and reduced commuting distances in order to ease traffic pressure in the last five years, Zhou said.  The municipal government has made financing plans for railways, urban roads and highways, with investment in transportation infrastructure totaling 340 billion yuan ($49.8 billion) between 2012 and 2016. This accounted for 13 percent of fixed-asset investment in Beijing in the period. Public transportation investment accounts for 75 percent of Beijing's total transportation infrastructure investment.  With the support of investment, the capital has accelerated the construction of transportation infrastructure to upgrade capacity.  The length of the urban rail network increased from 372 kilometers to 574 km from 2012 to 2016. During the same period, the city's road length increased from 6,258 km to 6,374 km, with highways extending from 912 km to 1,014 km and bus lanes increasing from 604 km to 845 km.  Green commuting - traveling by bike or public transport - is becoming increasingly popular, according to BMCT.  The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei coordinated development strategy is promoting traffic integration, according to Zhou.  The Beijing-Zhangjiakou high-speed railway is a key project for solving the problem of northwest commuting and enhancing the integration of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei, Zhou added.  It will promote coordinated development and support Winter Olympic traffic, because roads linking Beijing and Zhangjiakou - the two co-hosts of the 2022 Winter Olympics - play a major role in transportation between the two cities.  Construction of the Beijing-Bazhou high-speed railway, a key link for the capital's new airport and Xiongan New Area, Hebei province, is planned to kick off in 2020.  The 698-km Beijing-Shenyang high-speed railway starts at Xinghuo Railway Station in Beijing and connects Chengde in Hebei province with Chaoyang and Fuxing in Liaoning province, before eventually reaching Shenyang.  In addition, the one-card-pass project of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei province, covering 1,011 downtown bus routes and 122 suburb bus routes, makes traffic integration more effective, according to officials.  The Beijing-Kunming Highway, national road 111, Beijing-Taipei expressway and other projects have been put into use, accelerating the connectivity of the regional road network, Zhou said.  These projects will help to relieve the strain on Beijing's non-capital functions to promote the adjustment of the city layout and spacial structure, and to build a modern transportation network with low cost and huge capacity, according to a senior municipal official.  Priority will be given to public transport, which can improve green travel efficiently. Around 850 km of bus lanes, four Bus Rapid Transit lines and 140 direct lines will form a metro-bus public transit system in Beijing, Zhou said. ", "overall-label": "politics"}
{"content": "  The China arm of Schneider Electric, the Rueil-Malmaison, France-headquartered company, is seeking to collaborate with various businesses in Shanghai to integrate the internet of things, or IoT, into traditional industries. John Tuccillo, senior vice-president, industry and government affairs at Schneider Electric, believes the IoT can be used in different industries as part of digitalization of manufacturing. The IoT can be described as a network of devices, vehicles, buildings and other objects that contain software or sensors that allow them to connect and exchange data. \"The application of the IoT will push not only the manufacturing industry ahead but other related fields, such as sewage disposal, healthcare, transportation and energy,\" said Tuccillo. \"Making different systems function together is what makes the IoT different to the internet of consumption. The IoT not only makes manufacturing more automatic but connects different systems.\" Eager to compete with other established rivals such as Swiss company ABB Group, the US-based General Electric and Germany's Siemens AG in the same field, the company promoted EcoStruxure, its open, interoperable, IoT-enabled system architecture in Shanghai last month. EcoStruxure has been already adopted by China Baosteel Group, one of China's largest steel producers by output. It helps Baosteel to increase safety of operators and non-operators in the workshop and improve productivity. Daily output will likely increase 15 to 30 percent to reach up to 10,500 tons. Schneider Electric now earns 45 percent of its revenue through the IoT. The platform combines operational technology and information technology into one management interface. Users can easily access the system to practise various complex operations. The whole procedure is as simple as tapping smartphone apps. \"It's like an industrialized Android system,\" said Ma Yue, senior vice-president, industry business, Schneider Electric China, the company's local arm. The system also creates a centralized multi-user collaboration platform, which allows itself to maintain configuration, administration and deployment locally or remotely. Combined with its sustainable design, the system can make a company a consumer of its own byproducts. The company currently has more than 700 researchers in China. The average time they take to bring a new product to market is 18 to 24 months. The company's China operation employs 26,000 staff across 26 factories, eight logistics centers, three research and development offices, five branches and 40 regional offices. China is also the second-largest market for Schneider Electric and the largest market of industrial automation, ahead of the US. \"We've set a long-term goal to sell one-fourth of our products in the Chinese market and the rest to global markets. China's Belt and Road Initiative is encouraging us to deploy more resources in China and other related markets,\" said Ma. Schneider Electric's technology prowess flows from its investment (5 percent of its revenue) in R&D. For that, it has established five regional research centers worldwide: in France, the United States, China, India and Mexico, respectively. \"China's growing demand for high-value products, especially automobiles, and home-related services, offers many growth points,\" said Sun Fuquan, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Science and Technology for Development in Beijing. Chen Bin, executive vice-president of the China Machinery Industry Federation, said China is making progress on the path to becoming an advanced and competitive economy, but it will take time for the required changes to have an impact on industry.

{"content": "Beijing will further open its market by allowing a number of wholly foreign-owned companies to provide outbound travel services to customers, a senior official of the city's tourism authority said on Tuesday. Cao Pengcheng, deputy head of the Beijing Municipal Commission of Tourism Development, said the commission was awaiting approval after submitting the document to the Ministry of Culture and Tourism. According to the plan, once the foreign travel agencies meet certain requirements, they will be qualified to take visitors on outbound travel, which means foreign-invested travel agencies will take a share from China's huge overseas tourist market. In 2003, the first wholly foreign-owned travel agency was set up in China. However, there were limitations on its service, as it could not offer outbound travel products. Shi Jianzhong, secretary-general of the Beijing Tourism Industry Association, said once the document is approved, domestic travel agencies' businesses could possibly be affected, but the new measure is the trend of the industry. Zhang Guodong, a publicity official at online travel agency ly.com, has a positive view of the new policy. He said it will not have too much of an impact since China's tourism industry grows 10 percent annually, which is a big market. Online travel businesses develop even faster, with an annual growth rate of 35 to 40 percent. \"Compared with the United States and Europe, whose online travel market is growing at 45 percent to 50 per-cent annually, we still have big growth potential,\" he said. \"Therefore, the new policy is not a big threat to online travel agencies like ly.com.\" \"Together with foreign-owned travel agencies, we should cooperate and make the market bigger and better.\" As incomes grow and consumption is upgraded, China's outbound tourist market has grown rapidly in recent years. According to data from the ministry, the number of outbound trips by Chinese tourists was 130 million in 2017, up 9 percent year-on-year. Chinese visitors spent $258 billion during their overseas trips, up 5 percent year-on-year.", "overall-label": "business"}
{"content": "The first phase of a new subway line connecting downtown Beijing to the new international airport under construction south of the city saw its first test run on Saturday, indicating that preparations for the opening of Beijing Daxing International Airport in September are in full swing, according to local officials. The rail transit line, designed to link the new airport in Daxing district and Caoqiao subway station in Fengtai district, spans 41.4 kilometers and passes through three subway stations in the capital. The train can reach speeds of up to 160 kilometers per hour. Automated subway trains will be used on the new airport line, said Yang Guangwu, chief engineer of the Beijing Major Projects Construction Headquarters Office. When put into operation in September along with the new airport, the trains will be capable of fully automated driverless operation and will be the fastest subway trains in China. Construction work at Beijing Daxing International Airport is expected to be completed by the end of this month, according to the Civil Aviation Administration of China. It will enter commercial operation before Sept 30. The new airport, which is located at the junction of Beijing's Daxing district and Langfang, a city in neighboring Hebei province, is designed to take pressure off the overcrowded Beijing Capital International Airport in the northeastern suburbs. Beijing Daxing International Airport is set to handle up to 45 million passengers annually by 2021, with the figure expected to rise to 72 million passengers by 2025. \"Operation of the new airport subway line means a lot to the capital's rail transit system, since it increases the average speed of urban rail transit in Beijing and will further boost the economic development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region,\" Yang said. The top speed of most subway trains in Beijing is currently around 80 km/h, he added. When the subway goes into operation, the 40-km journey from the city's south Third Ring Road at Caoqiao station to the terminals at the new airport will only take 19 minutes, said Jiang Chuanzhi, designer of the new airport line. He said the trains have a business-class carriage, six regular carriages and one for luggage, with each carriage about 22.8 meters long and 3.3 meters wide. Each train will be able to carry up to 1,500 passengers. Four elevators and two escalators will be installed at each station along the line, Jiang said. There are wheelchair spaces and USB charging ports next to the passenger seats on the trains, which are also equipped with variable-frequency air conditioners and LED lighting systems to save energy. According to the capital's railway corporation, the airport subway line was designed as part of the city's first three-layer cluster of transport infrastructure, with the subway line and an expressway above ground and a gas pipeline underground to fully use the space available. When the new airport in Daxing opens, it will increase the area of terminal facilities in Beijing by 700,000 square meters. The airport will have four runways and 268 parking bays, which will be able to accommodate 620,000 flights a year. At present, Beijing has two airports that serve commercial flights: Beijing Capital International Airport in Shunyi district and Beijing Nanyuan Airport in Fengtai district.", "overall-label": "tech"}

{"content": "Feeling stifled at home, many members of Hong Kong's artistic community are moving to Beijing and other mainland cities, where audiences are eager to explore innovative ideas and performances. Miriam Zhang reports. Beijing is experiencing an immigration boom of sorts, as artists from Hong Kong head to the city in search of opportunities they are unlikely to find at home. The exodus has been spurred by increasing artistic freedom in the capital and the government's preferential policies for artists, not to mention the Chinese mainland's huge market for visual and performing arts. In Hong Kong, Gary Mok Waihong was just a wannabe artist. He loved art, but was never going to make it in his home city. Today, he owns a studio in Beijing and is a full-time artist and curator of shows, including exhibitions in Hong Kong, Macao and the mainland. He worked hard to get where he is. After many years of study, he completed preparations for art school in time to become one of the first students from Hong Kong to graduate from the bachelor's program at the Central Academy of Fine Arts, China's leading visual arts institute, in 2007. Having arrived in Beijing in 2000, Mok revels in a cultural melting pot, where new ideas are embraced with enthusiasm and curiosity, and people with diverse talents have the opportunity to express themselves and develop. \"There are some intriguing art groups in Beijing. Even heavy metal music is more advanced here than in Hong Kong. It would be hard to find a similar group of people that come together regularly for art in the Hong Kong arts community,\" he said. Much changed in the years after his arrival. Other \"creatives\" followed his path to find their place in Beijing's artistic community, including painters, dancers, singers, actors and screenwriters. The process is continuing as young hopefuls arrive in search of opportunities unavailable at home.,Mok always dreamed of being an artist, but the nearest he got in Hong Kong was working for a design company. In 1995, when he graduated from high school, he applied to the Chinese University of Hong Kong, the only school in the city that offered a program in visual arts. However, he failed the Chinese-language exam, so he wasn't chosen. Later, he was desperate to attend the prestigious academy in Beijing, but at the time it wasn't taking students from Hong Kong. Even after Hong Kong returned to the motherland in 1997, there were no openings for the city's students at the academy. The restrictions were lifted in 2001, when new policies opened the doors to young artists from Hong Kong and Macao. Mok finally had his chance, but he had to demonstrate that he had talent. He was assessed in sketching, speed drawing and color blending - the prerequisites for admission - but he really wasn't ready for all that. As far as he was concerned, he was a lowly office worker at a design company with no formal art education, and he would be competing for a place alongside students from across China, many of whom had been honing their skills all their lives. He failed to gain a place, so he signed up for remedial classes. \"I was the only student from Hong Kong, and also the most senior,\" he recalled, adding that the other students, who were all much younger, called him \"uncle.\" It was three years before Mok mastered the requisite skills. Having finally been accepted by the academy, he swept through his bachelor's degree and went on to study for a master's.,Today, students from Hong Kong who want to follow their art school dream have an easier ride because institutions across the mainland welcome promising young people from the city. According to the Office of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China in Beijing, about 70 students from the city are enrolled at the three top art schools on the mainland: the Central Conservatory of Music; the Central Academy of Drama; and the Central Academy of Fine Arts. The number of students is expected to rise after the three schools joined the Scheme for Admission of Hong Kong Students to Mainland Higher Education Institutions this year. Under the program, students from Hong Kong can apply directly to the three schools. Provided they pass the auditions or assessments, they will simply have to submit their results from the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education Examination as part of their application. By the start of the year, 112 mainland universities had signed up for the program, 10 more than last year. The program has seen 10,185 Hong Kong students enroll since it started in 2012, with most studying finance, medicine and engineering. Gong Wan, director of the China Education Exchange (Hong Kong) Centre, expects to see a rise in the number of students from Hong Kong applying to mainland arts institutions. Speaking at an education expo in Hong Kong in February, Zhang Feiran, from the admissions office of the Central Academy of Drama, said the school received 50 applications from Hong Kong at the beginning of the current academic year, and seven applicants were offered places. Next year, under the education exchange program, the number of applicants from Hong Kong is expected to at least double.,In Beijing, the enthusiasm for novelty has opened doors for niche artists such as Tsang Tsz-kin, who teaches contact improvisation, a form of modern dance. Having accompanied his wife when she was transferred to Beijing from Hong Kong two years ago, Tsang initially resigned himself to being a stay-at-home house husband. Instead, he runs a contact improvisation workshop, and attracts new students by promoting his program through social media platforms such as WeChat. \"I teach eight classes every week. That would never have happened in Hong Kong.\" he said. The numbers tell the story. For example, in 2017, the gross take for performing arts at box offices across the mainland was 17.6 billion yuan ($2.57 billion), while in Hong Kong it was HK$506 million ($64.5 million), according to the China Association of Performing Arts and the Hong Kong Arts Development Council. After graduating from the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts, Tsang opened his own studio to teach performance art in the city. Although he did pretty well, he grew weary of the repetitive teaching routine. \"Being a teacher became a job, not a career.\" he said. He became involved with contact improvisation 20 years ago, regarding the form as a way of liberating dancers from repetitive gestures by replacing them with movements between people in contact. Tsang found it hard to promote the dance form at home. \"It wasn't until I left Hong Kong that I realized people there are very conservative,\" he said. He added that some of his students seemed more concerned with winning awards than performing dance moves. In addition, he found that Hong Kong audiences didn't really appreciate his art. According to the Hong Kong Annual Arts Survey report, published in November by the Hong Kong Arts Development Council, audience numbers at dance performances in the city were the lowest among all forms of performance art, including music, theater and opera. The numbers fell for five consecutive years, from 271,000 in 2012 to 213,000 in 2017. Tsang has experienced big changes during his two years in Beijing, where audiences are enthusiastic and enjoy his contact improvisation dance. \"If they don't know about a new thing, they are willing to learn and figure it out.\" he said. He has become active in the mainland's contact improvisation community: \"I know this dance form is drawing audiences in big cities in addition to Beijing, such as Shanghai, Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang province, and Chongqing.\" He has also been impressed by the receptiveness of audiences in lower-tier cities. He recalled the time he was invited to share his skills at a workshop in Xi'an, capital of Shaanxi province, one of the biggest cities in northwest China. Many of those attending had traveled from smaller cities, such as Lanzhou, capital of Gansu province, and Yinchuan, capital of the Ningxia Hui autonomous region. \"Those people were willing to spend more than two days traveling to another city just to learn about something new. That was really precious,\" Tsang said. In July, the China National Arts Fund announced that practitioners from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan had been invited to apply for financial support, which could amount to as much as 4 million yuan per project. The practitioners are also eligible for training programs subsidized by the fund, while arts organizations on the mainland are being encouraged to work with Hong Kong's art institutions to promote creative synergy and cultural exchanges. Established in 2013, the arts fund has awarded 11.3 million yuan through seven art exchange projects related to Hong Kong, and artists from the city have participated in 15 national projects supported by the funding. In 2017, Cheng Shing-tai, a 42-year-old conductor from Hong Kong, joined a project at the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing. The monthlong program gave him the opportunity to work with 17 musicians from different provinces and with the China National Traditional Orchestra, the country's leading ensemble of its kind. Cheng was the only student in his master's class for conductors of Chinese music at the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts. \"Our faculty was established in 2011, but the education facilities and teaching resources are relatively poor,\" he said. The exchange project gave him more opportunities to practice his skills. Cheng was excited when he learned the national funding was open to artists from Hong Kong, and said he would definitely apply if he could find suitable projects. Nurturing cultural talent and promoting exchanges among arts groups have been written into the blueprint for the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, which was released by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, China's Cabinet, in February. In the meantime, local artists will continue to cross the border to seek their fortunes on the mainland.", "overall-label": "education"}

Tang Muhai started the concert by conducting the first movement of   composed by Guan Xia, the head of the China National Symphony Orchestra.

In January 1958, Li conducted the piece at his first concert with the CNSO after he returned from the Moscow Conservatory.   Born into an official's family in Beijing, Li started to learn music when he joined the school orchestra of Fu Jen Catholic University of Peking where he majored in history.  In 1940, he was admitted to the Shanghai Music Institute to learn the cello.  He went to study conducting at the Moscow Conservatory from 1953 to 1957. In the 1950s and '60s, he gave regular \"weekend concerts\" in Beijing to promote classical music. During the \"cultural revolution\", he initiated moves to make the yangbanxi (the eight revolutionary Peking Opera repertoire) into a symphonic piece to help the orchestra survive.", "overall-label": "life-style"}
{"content": "Since it opened in March last year, China's first hospice for people with terminal cancer has provided professional care and a relatively peaceful end to life for about 100 patients. Affiliated to Peking University Shougang Hospital in Beijing, the hospice serves as a \"tribute\" to the dignity of human life, even in the final stages, and the laws of nature, said Gu Jin, the founder who is also head of the hospital. The veteran cancer surgeon urged more public awareness and support for end-stage patients, who are often subjected to unnecessary treatments and have to endure the resultant pain. In such cases, quality hospice care is far more useful than costly, but redundant, medical procedures, he said. \"Hospice care helps patients who have little time left, and also reduces the financial burden on their families.\" In China, the lion's share of medical resources devoted to cancer are invested in diagnosis and treatment. That means leading public hospitals lack the incentive to provide hospice care, which is labor intensive and less profitable than treatment. The Shougang hospice employs four doctors and 10 nurses, which is barely sufficient to meet demand. According to Gu, each patient spends one month on average in the hospice, but 20 to 30 new names are added to its waiting list every month. In general, hospice care involves procedures such as pain relief and psychological counseling to help provide a respectful end to life with as little suffering as possible. The risk of contracting cancer rises as people grow older. That means China's rapidly aging population may pose an increased risk of a cancer epidemic in the years to come. In many big cities, where life spans are generally longer, cancer is the leading cause of death among people with illnesses. Moreover, in Beijing, the disease accounts for 26.8 percent of all deaths, according to the city's health authority. \"The number is still rising in Beijing and across the country with the growing 'gray population',\" Gu said. By the end of last year, 241 million people in China were age 60 or older, accounting for more than 17 percent of the population. The number is expected to reach 487 million by 2050, about 35 percent of the population by that time, official statistics show. To be better prepared to cope with the rising demand for hospice services, Gu urged the government to formulate more support policies and provide financial support to train and provide more high-quality care givers. shanjuan@chinadaily.com.cn", "overall-label": "politics"}

Held from Nov 7 to 9 in Wuzhen, this year's conference aimed to advocate exchanges, mutual learning, cooperation and sharing in the digital fields, and to push for peace and development in global cyberspace. \"As we can feel in Wuzhen, China's digitalization is speeding up and the town is becoming more and more international,\" Pony Ma, chairman and CEO of Tencent Group, told participants at the conference's opening ceremony on Wednesday. \"It's fair to say that Wuzhen has become an epitome of China's booming internet industry,\" said Ma. About 1,500 guests from 76 countries and regions, including government representatives, heads of international organizations, leading figures of internet companies, online celebrities, experts and scholars, attended the conference. \"To many, retired elderly people are supposed to sit quietly while reminiscing about their old days, but the internet has changed everything,\" said Wuzhen resident Hu Hui. By sharing dressing tips, square dance classes and performing Shaoxing Opera with fans, the 80-year-old senior citizen has gained about 10,000 views on the Chinese video-sharing app Douyin.

Face-scanning technology has replaced the gate pass. While guests can check-in at the Binzhi AI Hotel by only swiping their ID card and scanning their face. In this digital town, some of the latest technological innovations, once viewed as the stuff of science fiction, are becoming reality. At the Light of Internet Expo held during the WIC, a model demonstrated how grocery stores can operate without cashiers. Cameras, powered by visual identification technology by ArcSoft Inc, identify fruit chosen by customers, allowing them to grab goods and checkout on their own. Visionox Co demonstrated a foldable smartphone with two 7.2-inch flexible screens that can be flipped open like a book, or folded to fit into a pocket. Chinese tech giant Baidu Inc also showcased its newly developed self-driving bus named Apolong at the expo. With no need for a human driver, the bus is able to smoothly navigate roads, while avoiding pedestrians and other vehicles. The inside of the vehicle resembles an entertainment room where passengers can watch movies, sing karaoke and enjoy a carefree ride. The bus began mass production in July and has been put into operation in semi-en-closed and enclosed areas, such as scenic areas and industrial parks, in Beijing, Xiamen in Fujian province and other Chinese cities. \"I see tens of thousands of self-driving vehicles running on connected roads in the future,\" said Zhang Yaqin, president of Baidu. \"This will bring fundamental changes to the relationship between men, vehicles and cities.\" Looking to connect them all is the world's largest telecommunications equipment manufacturer Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, which used Wuzhen to demonstrate its latest 5G technology. The conference also brought news of the sizeable boom China's digital economy is going through, with the release of the World Internet Development Report 2018 and China Internet Development Report 2018 on Thursday morning. In 2017, the size of China's digital economy grew to 27.2 trillion yuan ($3.9 trillion), accounting for 32.9 percent of the nation's GDP, up 2.6 percentage points on the previous year. In all, the booming digital economy contributed about 55 percent to the country's GDP growth in 2017. As of December 2017, China has a total of 102 listed internet enterprises at home and abroad, up 12 percent year-on-year. As of June, the number of China's netizens reached 802 million, among which 788 million are mobile phone users. The reports also found that the volume of information consumption more than doubled, from 2.2 trillion yuan in 2013 to 4.5 trillion yuan in 2017, with year-on-year growth of 20 percent. \"In the last five years, we've seen China move into the heart of the digital economy, not just in numbers, but also with innovation,\" said Fadi Chehade, senior consultant to the executive chairman of the World Economic Forum.

The term refers to the coexistence of different languages as well as the conflicts between them, and it also reflects the plurality and fluidity that characterize our contemporary culture and society, where independent, uncompromising voices and ideas come at us through a variety of different agencies, but which nonetheless intertwine with each other and participate equally in the discussions and debates of a shared contemporary landscape. As the theme of this exhibition, Heteroglossia also provides a critical line of inquiry into it and invests the whole exhibition by formulating a dialogue between the artists and a world that has become more and more complex and challenging.

It also calls for the creation of a catalogue of excellent tourism providers and the promotion of their brands. A China Tourism Academy report shows over 62 million Chinese traveled overseas in the first half of the year, 5 percent more than during the same period of 2016. Nearly 70 million overseas tourists visited China in the first six months of 2017. \"Online reputations reflect travelers' comments about scenic spots in a relatively objective way,\" BISU's Tourism Big Data Center's executive director Deng Ning says. \"Our analyses will help scenic areas improve management and service, and to better market themselves.\",Big data enables strategic decision making, he explains. For instance, it shows the peak and low seasons, so providers can boost numbers during downtimes, using tactics such as cutting ticket prices. But China's tourism industry's big data analysis is still in its infancy. \"Big data can be used to summarize tourists' consumption and behaviors, and contribute to academic research of the tourism industry,\" BISU School of Tourism Management professor Zhang Lingyun says. \"The boom in social-networking platforms will produce more user-generated content, and their comments and travel experiences will largely affect others' decisions.\" Experts also discussed the development of China's smart tourism and information-technology applications. Artificial intelligence is the future of smart tourism, Zhang says. He suggests such possibilities as unmanned transportation and automated tour guides. Already, augmented - and virtual-reality technologies can be used to vividly render ancient ruins' original splendor.,BES Woniu (Beijing) Tourist Attraction Management Co Ltd chair Xu Ting recalls his unique experience of using facial-recognition technology upon entering Wuzhen, a popular destination in Zhejiang province. The ancient water town is also celebrated as an IT hub. \"It's an inspiration to explore new ways of ticket-checking,\" he says. \"And artificial intelligence will optimize the management of scenic areas. The problem of management should be used to plan smart scenic areas. For example, big data analyses can measure scenic spots' capacity to accept visitors and vehicles.\" Xu believes scenic areas will be better able to efficiently deploy such resources as staff and shuttle buses to avoid problems like overcrowding if tourists are able to book tickets online in advance. He suggests scenic areas offer platforms for consultation, interaction, mobile payment and online promotion. Beijing founded a tourism-industry big data center in partnership with the travel agency China CYTS Tours and mobile-data-service platform TalkingData this spring. The center crunches data about visitor demographics, such as where they come from. Indeed, big data will increasingly expand its role in China's travel sector. It's poised to go beyond assessing reputations based on travelers' reviews to ensuring these reputations are increasingly deserved by improving their services.

{"content": "Like millions of working women in China, Tracy Liu too rides the subway home, but with a difference. While most of her peers are busy chatting on phones or engaging in conversation, the Beijing-based 25-year-old office worker spends her time reading English novels on Mint Reading, an English-reading program installed on the WeChat platform by Chengdu Chaoyouai Education Technology. Liu spends 149 yuan ($21.4) to purchase content on Mint Reading, which typically allows her to read three novels within 100 days. What is different is that the interactive app is not just about reading novels, but also brushing up one's vocabulary and knowledge, said Liu as she focused her attention to the next chapter of The Great Gatsby, F Scott Fitzgerald's 1925 classic. Once she logs into the course, she will go through the daily vocabulary list, read a chapter and then answer questions based on the story. And what really motivates her is the last step, sharing her daily effort, or in other words the number of words she has read, on her WeChat. \"I am too busy to find suitable time to read books and improve myself. The fragmented time on the subway actually provides me with a learning opportunity, while the sharing allows me to show my friends that I am studying hard and in turn wins me lots of likes on WeChat,\" said Liu. Liu and Mint Reading are just one of the millions of people and startups who are looking to carve out a niche in China's rapidly growing knowledge sharing economy, where paid content is king. Xue Yongfeng, an analyst at Beijing-based internet consultancy Analysys, said that customers are now willing to pay for virtual content whereas earlier they were willing to do so only if it was something physical that they could relate to. \"With income levels rising and new payment options emerging, netizens are now more willing to pay for their favorite content,\" Xue said. And statistics do bear the fact that the online paid knowledge market is on the cusp of a boom in China. Last year, the industry generated more than 4.9 billion yuan in economic output, up 300 percent year-on-year, according to a recent industry report from iResearch, a market consultancy firm. Buoyed by the gradual increase in market awareness and the growing number of users who are willing to pay for high-quality knowledge services, the online paid knowledge market in China is set to maintain relatively high growth in the next three years and reach 23.5 billion yuan by 2020, the report said. The report said there would be a slowdown in the traditional publishing, education, media and other related sectors, while skilled professionals will flood into the knowledge services industry that has a short monetization process and huge potential for growth. On one hand, the knowledge market will further expand in the future. On the other hand, limited by the attention of individual users and the range of acceptable per customer transactions of targeted users, its growth rate will decline and become stable eventually, it said. Guan Qingyou, director and chief economist at Rushi Advanced Institute of Finance, believes that knowledge consumption is growing steadily in China due to the increase of mid-income earners and consumption upgrading. \"The existing content on offer is unable to satisfy market demand, and specialized knowledge will be the future,\" Guan said at a payment summit held in Beijing in June. \"Currently, the market does not lack good payment channels, but it lacks high-quality content. And people are actually willing to pay for good content.\" Guan added for the paid knowledge content providers, the biggest obstacle was the sustainability of the content rather than consumer demand. According to a report published by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the Social Sciences Academic Press, most of the paid knowledge consumers are between 21 and 40 years old. Born in the 1980s and 1990s, these millennials are mainly living in first-and second-tier cities, usually earning 5,000 yuan to 8,000 yuan a month. Those young groups are usually newcomers or middle-level manager in companies, having a higher requirement for practical skills and knowledge content. However, their fragmented spare time cannot support continuous course learning, and it is really hard for them to select needed knowledge content from a vast amount of online information. This is where the high-quality paid content comes in and helps them gain access to learning materials they really need. According to the report, the online paid knowledge market boasted 188 million users by the end of 2017, compared to 93 million users by 2016. Sensing the boom in the market, a growing number of companies have made their moves and some have even reaped the fruits. Audio sharing platform Ximalaya has seen rapid growth since it tapped into the paid content business in 2016 to encourage professionals to sell their knowledge online. For instance, the paid music course by Tian Yimiao, an associate professor at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, has gained more than 13 million views on the Ximalaya platform, making Tian a new online celebrity. \"In the mobile era, everyone's time is getting fragmented,\" Ximalaya said in an email to China Daily. \"Our goal is not to occupy users' time, but help them save time. Compared with traditional offline education training, audio content will help users make full use of their fragmented time, catering to their specific needs.\" Statistics from app tracker Analysys Qianfan show Ximalaya is the largest audiobook platform in terms of active user numbers, with more than 70 million monthly active users in September. Ximalaya claimed the online knowledge payment sector is currently at the very early stage of development, and it still lacks a huge amount of high-quality content in various categories. \"The key is providing content that has practical uses. In-depth and professional content will be the future, and it is of great importance to focus on the social and community functions on the platform,\" the company said. According to the company, professionals from the education sector and grassroots entrepreneurs are quickly occupying the market as there is immense potential in segments like history and self-improvement content. Statistics from market research company iiMedia Research show that 63.6 percent of surveyed paid content consumers aim to gain professional knowledge and 50.3 percent of the consumers paid for the content out of personal interest. \"With people embracing a new era of online knowledge payment, platforms will continuously offer a series of quality content to meet their growing need for lifelong learning. But competition in the market segments will also be fiercer in the near future,\" iiMedia said.", "overall-label": "tech"}

The country will continue to shorten the negative list for foreign investment and allow wholly foreign-funded businesses to operate in more sectors, Han said in a speech at the opening of the annual China Development Forum. He pledged that the country will make unwavering efforts to develop a world-class business environment and encourage foreign businesses to conduct research, development and innovation in China. \"We will step up our efforts for IPR protection as well as law enforcement in various aspects, and establish a system of punitive punishment for IPR infringement to significantly raise the cost of violating the law,\" he said. He also emphasized that more efforts will be made to improve the transparency and predictability of policies, adding that businesses of various types registered in China will be offered the same treatment in government procurement programs so that foreign businesses can enjoy better development in China. The country will further expand its 12 pilot free trade zones and support Hainan province to develop itself into a free trade port step by step, he said. Ning Jizhe, deputy head of the National Development and Reform Commission, said at the forum that China will deepen the opening of the agricultural, mining, manufacturing and service sectors. He said that the nation will speed up building an index system to evaluate its business environment based on international standards, adding that such a system will be piloted in some provinces and cities this year and be fully implemented nationwide next year. China is one of the most attractive destinations for foreign investment, and foreign direct investment hit $135 billion last year, he noted. Director of the OECD Directorate for Financial and Enterprise Affairs Greg Medcraft said China has adopted measures to encourage free trade, and free trade has traditionally driven economic growth worldwide. \"What is amazing about China is that now they are into the next phase of development and they are thinking about how they can be more efficient by having more private sector competition against the SOEs (State-owned enterprises),\" he said.", "overall-label": "politics"}
{"content": "Wang Xin is a landscape designer by profession and a farmer in practice. His customers believe the strawberries he grows on his organic plantation in the southern outskirts of Beijing are \"the best in China\". Every day, when men and women of similar age are stuck in heavy traffic and endless meetings, the 33-year-old revels in his rural life, far from the downtown crowds. He rises with the sun and works all day in the fields or visits the farmers' market to sell his fresh produce. At the end of the day, he goes to bed with sore muscles and falls into a deep sleep. He does not take time to consider whether the work is hard, preferring to get on with the job. \"It has become my lifestyle. This is the life I chose to live,\" he said. In a country where food is so central to the national culture, many well-educated urbanites like Wang are returning to the countryside and dedicating themselves to growing fresher, healthier food. Every Tuesday, Saturday and Sunday, Wang brings freshly-picked strawberries to the organic farmers' market in Beijing. They are grown naturally in nutrient-rich soil, without the use of fertilizers, pesticides, growth hormones or chemicals. \"I don't plan on becoming filthy rich, or I wouldn't have gone for organic farming,\" Wang said. With his firm, athletic build and healthy tan, it is hard to picture him as the designer who used to spend days and nights in front of a computer screen. Having majored in landscape botany, Wang has always been a plant lover. When he was 25, he realized his sedentary lifestyle was making him gain weight, and he could no longer stand being an office drone. He quit his job, rented two plantation sheds in the suburbs and started his farming career from scratch. Last month, Wang presented this winter's first fruit from a batch he planted in September. However, the work really began in July, when he prepared all-natural organic matter to enrich the soil. The formula has been perfected through years of research in collaboration with Beijing University of Agriculture, where he studied, to simulate the formation of the fertile dark forest soil of Northeast China, known for its high crop yields. Logically, the true foundation of organic farming lies in soil content: if the soil is right - as a living organism with a complex organic structure - the outcome is safe, and tasty food can be grown without the need for fertilizing chemicals, according to Wang. But quality produce is not his only objective. He hopes to build a cultivation model that rejuvenates the soil itself, because regular planting and overexploitation can lead to soil degradation within a matter of years. Wang's life on the farm has not always been a smooth ride, but after a rough start he believes he has learned valuable lessons. He has gone back to his old university and visited colleagues in Tochigi prefecture, Japan, to study the most modern organic farming techniques. \"For organic farming to become truly sustainable, revitalization of the soil is key. I am certain that in three to four years, the soil I have been reviving will keep getting healthier and healthier,\" he said.,Wang is not the only person working hard to master soil rejuvenation. In Alshaa League, a semi-arid region in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region in North China, Ma Yanwei has spent years reinvigorating saline soil by applying water-saving methods to cultivate fruit and crops suitable for local conditions. Sweet melons are the best-selling produce from Ma's farm. Their sweet taste is the result of many years of study, experimentation and hard work in the desert. Ma aims to find an ideal organic farming method to maximize the use of the scarce water resources and repair the soil. \"As long as the soil improves, it is natural to harvest healthy produce,\" he said. In the past six years, he has seen a growing number of young people returning to the countryside to take up farming. In 2017, he established a network that allows new farmers to communicate, exchange experiences and help each other. \"It means we will be able to avoid longer detours and the mistakes made by others,\" he said.,For 18 years, Zhang Zhimin, who used to work as a foreign trade expert, has been building an idyllic farm in the southwestern suburbs of Beijing to produce food crops and preserve biodiversity. As a speaker of several languages, Zhang was sent to work in the food import-export sector when China opened its market to the outside world. She believes that \"agriculture is the art of man and nature working together\". On her biofarm, called Heaven's Blessings, nature rules man. Instead of eliminating weeds and pests, the wholesome biosphere works autonomously to produce seasonal harvests. \"Agriculture is the management of life, and life should be nourished by life itself,\" Zhang said. At Heaven's Blessings, trees, bushes, grasses, insects, birds and cattle coexist harmoniously. The place is more like a habitat than a farm. In early summer, Zhang chops tender leaves and weeds that grow in the shade of the peach trees to feed her cattle and make room for grass-based crops to thrive. In early autumn, she lets the cows roam free to finish the weeding process.,In Wang's vegetable shed, the natural ecosystem ensures the harvest is healthy and no outside intervention is necessary. \"I have observed that the grass that coexists with the crops functions as a regulatory factor for the microclimate by keeping the soil moist,\" he said. Also, a native species of spider that weaves webs among the vegetables feeds on minuscule whiteflies that are usually hard to detect, thus preventing the need for harmful insecticides. Having learned about the latest farming models in Japan, Germany and Israel, Wang has also turned to ancient Chinese agricultural traditions to find inspiration to better coordinate human activities with nature. At a Farmers' Assembly at China Agricultural University last month, Meng Fanqiao, a professor at the university's College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, said organic/ecological farming is an important measure to improve the quality and safety of agricultural produce. \"Organic/ecological farming is of vital significance for economic development as well as environmental protection in rural areas. It should play a leading role in China's rural revitalization and the building of an 'ecological civilization',\" Meng said. Ma Xiaochao, a project officer with Know Your Food, a community group that focuses on food sustainability, said, \"We hope to promote healthy eating as a mainstream choice, along with organic ways of producing healthy foods.\" Jin Shuqin, from the Research Center for the Rural Economy at the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, said: \"The green development of the countryside is a strategy that goes hand-in-hand with food security and higher incomes. Revitalizing the environment is a crucial aspect of overall rural rejuvenation.\"", "overall-label": "politics"}

At present, the Beijing government has signed contracts with villages and companies on construction work expected to start soon on some pieces of collective land, Economic Information Daily reported. In July last year, the central government chose 13 cities including Beijing, Shanghai and Shenyang to carry out pilot reform of building residential buildings for rent on collective land. Beijing had arranged 204 hectares of collective construction land by the end of last year, said Guan Aijun, an official from Beijing Municipal Commission for City Planning and Land Resources Management. Another 200 hectares will be added in 2018, he said. In addition to Beijing, other pilot cities are also stepping up exploration.

{"content": "Classic theater productions' adaptations are inevitably compared with the originals\u00a3\u00adfor better or for worse. This perhaps explains the mixed reviews of contemporary director Meng Jinghui's take on Teahouse, based on the original by novelist and playwright Lao She (1899-1966)\u00a3\u00ada household name in China. Some say it's difficult to understand since the script departs so much from the original. Meng considers it \"a spiritual visit to Lao She\". Over 1,000 people attended the premiere at the Grand Theater in Zhejiang province's Wuzhen town on Oct 18. Lao She wrote Teahouse in 1956. Beijing People's Art Theater debuted the work in 1958, and the play is still one of its most popular. It depicts changes experienced by all walks of life during the final years of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), and the periods that follow, including the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression (1931-45) and New China's founding in 1949. Meng swaps the Yutai Teahouse's traditional architecture for a steel wheel that's 19 meters long, 16 meters wide and 11 meters high. It was created by set designer Zhang Wu, who has collaborated with Meng on over 30 plays, and is meant to symbolize each character's fate over time. Film actor Wen Zhang plays the teahouse's boss, Wang Lifa. Meng's three-hour play opens with Wang and 17 other performers clad in white tops and black pants giving monologues in turn as they sit on the wheel. Musician Shao Yanpeng and Beijing-based rock band Nova Heart composed the music, featuring elements of rock, electronica and hiphop for Meng's Teahouse.,\"It is an artist's most basic right to adapt classics into contemporary theater,\" Meng says. \"A classic play isn't a museum exhibit. It should be kept alive and it should continue to evolve. It's an aesthetic adventure for audiences.\" Meng, a 53-year-old Beijing native and Central Academy of Drama graduate, has staged more than 40 works, including Rhinoceros in Love, Two Dogs, To Live and Amber. His avant-garde, critical and humorous style is said to have enabled him to bring new vitality to Chinese theater. He adapted Chinese writer Yu Hua's acclaimed novel, To Live, into a three-hour play of the same title in 2012. The director adapted The Four Dreams by Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) playwright Tang Xianzu in 2016. Meng first read the script of Teahouse as a university student and later watched the play at the Capital Theater. He also saw movies, TV dramas and books based on the work. Meng worked with German dramaturg Sebastian Kaiser to not only adapt Teahouse into a contemporary context but also to generate a dialogue between Chinese and German artists. \"We spent six months reading the original texts of the play by Lao She before we started the rehearsals,\" Kaiser says. \"We also visited the museum of Lao She and the Lao She Teahouse in Beijing. It was an exciting process. We decided not to be intimidated by the classic play, which is like a big mountain in front of us. It's like a journey of seeking direction.\" Some might say that adaptations destroy the classic play, but what they did was to show respect for a theater heritage, he says. \"It is a salute to Lao She.\",Kaiser says he kept asking Meng and the Chinese actors about the play's characters and lines. The dramaturg also asked himself questions\u00a3\u00adlike, \"Who is my favorite character?\"\u00a3\u00adand realized the answers constantly change. \"We tried to understand Lao She, to understand Teahouse and to discover the meanings that were not shown to the audience,\" Kaiser says. Teahouse was staged at the Wuzhen Grand Theater from Oct 18 to Monday at the ongoing Sixth Wuzhen Theater Festival, which Meng co-founded. The festival, which runs through Sunday, features 109 performances of 29 plays from 17 countries. Other classic plays adapted by international theater companies are running in Wuzhen, including Anton Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard, staged by Tianjin People's Art Theater, and Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot, performed by Radu Stanca National Theatre from Romania.

{"content": "  After a period of explosive growth, the financial technology - or fintech - sector in China will likely see slower but more regulated growth, with greater emphasis on leveraging technology to drive true innovation, analysts said.  China has emerged as a leading fintech market globally, with analysts estimating the market size to have exceeded $243 billion by the end of last year, accounting for about 85 percent of the global market share.  The sector's fast and furious growth was also illustrated by the surge of fintech investment in the country, which attracted capital of $8.8 billion between July 2015 to June 2016, equivalent to an increase of 252 percent since 2010, according to a report by Singaporean banking giant DBS Group and global accounting firm Ernst & Young.  Chinese fintech companies have been thriving through meeting the market's growing demand for financial services that are underserved by the country's traditional banking sector.  Internet giants such as Alibaba Group and Tencent Holdings have made a name for themselves both at home and internationally with their third-party electronic payment services, as well as the online wealth management products.  Peer-to-peer lending, small and micro loan services, as well as online insurance sales, have also flourished by taking advantage of the rapid digitalization and explosive online and mobile penetration in China.  Behind the sector's phenomenal growth were rising risks and irregularities that have alerted the country's financial regulators. Stringent measures have been adopted by the regulators, aiming to incorporate the fintech sector into the country's financial regulatory framework. New rules have also been drafted to tackle financial fraud and protect the interests of smaller investors and players in the sector.  One example is the tightened regulation of internet-based micro loan services. Media reports said that the People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, has suspended the approval of applications for setting up new online micro-loan lending services.    Analysts believe that the torrid growth of China's fintech sector will inevitably slow, which will present both challenges and opportunities for the companies, especially as more mature regulations are imposed, and a degree of consolidation may take place.  Chen Huan, chief strategy officer of CreditEase Group, a Beijing-based financial technology firm and peer-to-peer lending platform, said that the future trend of the fintech will put an emphasis on greater standardization, professionalism and a scale-driven business model.  \"In essence, the fintech companies and the traditional financial institutions are the same. The key is whether you have better means to obtain data and information so that you can know your clients better and be able to provide various services,\" Chen said.  Cliff Sheng, partner and head of financial services for Oliver Wyman Greater China, said that future fintech companies will differentiate themselves by pushing the frontiers of technological innovation as the window of regulatory arbitrage closes.  Big-data analytics, the internet of things and blockchain are the three most representative technologies, owing to their ground-breaking capabilities to acquire, assemble, analyze and apply information, according to Sheng.  \"With the ongoing integration of fintech into the regulatory framework, we believe the development of fintech in China has reached a turning point. From now, technology will be the key driver of valuechain disruption in an increasingly data-driven industry,\" Sheng said in a report.  China will continue to dominate the global fintech industry with a very strong domestic market, analysts with DBS Group and E&Y said in the report.  Capital investment will pour in and the market is being bolstered by substantial government support for innovation, they said, adding that demand will continue to be driven by underserved small and medium-sized companies and tech-savvy, often unbanked, consumers keen to access financial services via their mobile phones.

Bush for two weeks and turned out a book twice as long as it had to be. \"I had quite a lot to say. It was an unusual place, and it was an amazing time, an experience that one couldn't have as a civilian,\" he says, adding that another place that he would like to go would be the international space station.,Travel means a lot to Dyer's writing. He says:\"It's like asking how do you feel about breathing. I just have the habit of doing it.\" As Dyer enjoys his second trip to China, he says that he is also interested in visiting India. Dyer's current China trip will take him from Beijing to Suzhou and then to Shanghai. Speaking about China, Dyer says: \"I just love it for all the 'cliched' reasons: vibrant future, the energy, so positive, you feel it and you see it. It's incredibly energized, and specially if you come from a weary exhausted old country like England.\" In his latest book White Sands: Experiences from the Outside World, he dedicates a whole chapter to the Forbidden City. And, in reviewer Jonathon Sturgeon's words on flavorwire.com, the chapter depicts \"a Dyer-like writer meeting a beautiful woman while doing book promotion in Beijing, and he wonders why momentous things tend to happen on the final night of travel.\" The book contains Dyer's observations of the modern Chinese mentality, when he writes about \"Min waiting in the reception, prepunctual as always, never tired, always smiling and happy - but with an air of harriedness beneath that smile as she asked if I'd slept well.\" And on the ancient Chinese palace complex, Dyer says: \"There were a lot of people here too, but the Forbidden City was the size of Cheltenham, so there was plenty of room for everyone. Jeez, it went on forever, and every bit looked exactly the same as every other bit: courtyards the size of football pitches, cloisters, sloping roofs with rooms beneath them.\" His travel-log styled mixture of writing blurs the line between fiction and nonfiction. And each of his books is very different - he has written about jazz, photography, literary criticism and films.,Asked about his choice of topics, he says: \"There will always be things I would be interested in and curious about, therefore writing a book could be a continuing self-education. I just want to find out about a subject to my own satisfaction to see why it has a great effect on me.\" Commenting on his works, James Wood in the New Yorker says: \"Geoff Dyer delights in producing books that are unique, like keys. There is nothing anywhere like Dyer's semi-fictional rhapsody about jazz, But Beautiful, or his book about the World War I, The Missing of the Somme, or his autobiographical essay about D. H. Lawrence, Out of Sheer Rage, or his travelogue Yoga for People Who Can't Be Bothered to Do It.\" Dyer, who was born in 1958 in Cheltenham, England, and graduated from Corpus Christi College, Oxford, says his parents are not readers of his works, and they have no books in the house except for the only one by him. He adds his passion for writing started with avid reading, and his career was launched by writing reviews. Dyer, who currently teaches two classes a week at the University of Southern California, says:\"The first stage of becoming a writer is to read a lot. The way you teach writing is by teaching reading.\" Dyer's works have been translated into 25 languages. And some of his Chinese versions are done by writer and translator Kong Yalei. Incidentally, it was Kong who introduced Dyer's body of work to Zhejiang Literature and Art Publishing House. \"I really enjoy Dyer's works, so I started to translate them,\" Kong says.\"But it's not easy. However, I've seldom seen a writer with the ability to bring sound and music to you when you are reading about them.\" Meanwhile, Dyer has two books coming out in China this year, one of which is dedicated to his icon and friend John Berger.,Typically, in March, Beijing and cities like Shanghai, Suzhou and Chengdu see literary talks and exchanges between local audiences and writers from the United States, United Kingdom, France and Australia, as well as between Chinese literary voices and the foreign writers. Geoff Dyer is one of the writers featuring at the 11th Bookworm Literary Festival (March 8-25). And many more will be involved during the festival and other events including Francophonie (March 8-31) and the Australian Writers' Week (March 15-24).

{"content": "Iconic auteur Chen Kaige clearly remembers the events of Oct 16, 1964, when he was walking home after school in downtown Beijing. Then a sudden flood of pedestrians carried him along to Wangfujing Street, around four kilometers from his school. When then 12-year-old Chen looked up, he saw copies of People's Daily being thrown into the air, with the front page headline \"China successfully explodes its first atomic bomb\". Chen, now 66, reveals this at a recent Beijing event to announce a new film titled   (I and My Motherland). Besides Chen, the first Chinese director to win the Cannes Film Festival's top honor, the Palme d'Or, for Farewell My Concubine in 1993, the upcoming film also features six other directors - Guan Hu (Mr Six); Xue Xiaolu (Finding Mr Right); Xu Zheng (Lost in Thailand); Ning Hao (Crazy Alien); Wen Muye (Dying to Survive); and Zhang Yibai (I Belonged to You). The film, comprising seven short stories, respectively, each made by one of the featured directors, is being produced by Huaxia Film Distribution Co Ltd to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Huang Jianxin, also an established filmmaker who is the chief producer, says: \"I feel thrilled to work with these excellent filmmakers. It's a rare moment.\" Huang says all the directors are passionate about the project, and they plan to discuss the scripts, film sets and casts in the coming weeks.,\"The film is about historic moments and collective memories that are etched in our minds,\" says Huang, who in recent years has produced blockbusters such as Operation Mekong. Meanwhile, Chen says the film will feature China's achievements in the past seven decades and the Chinese drive for a better future. The other six directors also share their most memorable historic moments. Wen recalls the moment when he entered the film industry in 2015, when Ning recruited him to direct and write the script of Dying to Survive, which became a phenomenal hit in 2018. \"I had written the script over three months but then felt completely clueless.\" Wen then turned on the television set and found that most channels were broadcasting live the military parade to mark the 70th anniversary of the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression (1931-45). \"When I turned off the TV I found myself reinvigorated. I finally understood why the young generation feel safe and confident,\" says Wen about the parade that refueled him with energy to return to the writing of Dying to Survive which shot him to fame. For Ning, one of the most commercially successful directors in China, his most memorable moment was seven days after the Wenchuan earthquake on May 12, 2008. When he and his colleagues were at the office, a series of car horns drew their attention. Then with more and more vehicles joining the chorus they realized that it was a collective mourning of the deaths as tradition demanded. \"At that moment you could feel that everyone's heart was connected,\" says Ning. Fu Ruoqing, the chairman of Huaxia Film, says the company got the idea to make the film around four months ago and says it will be very inspirational. The film is scheduled to open across the mainland during the National Day holiday week in early October. ", "overall-label": "life-style"}

{"content": "  Online streaming site iQiyi has paid a record 420 million yuan ($61.8 million) for the rights to remake China's all-time highest-grossing movie,   into a television series. Film and television production company Shanghai New Culture Media Group revealed in a regulatory filing that it had sold the exclusive online streaming rights to Beijing-based iQiyi. The blockbuster, written, produced and directed by Stephen Chow grossed 3.39 billion yuan at the box office when it was released in 2016. As well as being China's highest-grossing movie,   broke numerous box office records upon its release, including biggest opening day sales and biggest single day sales in its opening week. The movie tells the story of a playboy businessman who falls in love with a mermaid that has been sent to assassinate him. In a similar filing it has also been reported that iQiyi has purchased the online streaming rights to serialize another of Chow's movies, this time    which was released during Spring Festival this year. The deal emphasizes the impact streaming video on demand (SVOD) has had on the Chinese market. According to financial services firm JPMorgan Chase & Co, China's online subscribers for SVOD will hit 144 million this year, accounting for 26.9 percent of all digital video viewers. Similarly, SVOD companies such as iQiyi and Tencent have been capitalizing on the market to create more original content and increase revenues from subscribers instead of relying solely on advertisers. At an industry conference held in Beijing on June 9, iQiyi announced that it will connect its online movie business with its open platformto enable movie producers to take advantage of iQiyi's data analytics, artificial intelligence and marketing resources. Yang Xianghua, senior vice-president of iQiyi, said the decision redefines the way that movie producers can access their audiences. \"iQiyi will provide an open platform to connect content creators with viewers in a more intelligent manner and help them in content creation, operation as well as monetization,\" Yang said. \"By doing so, we can effectively lower the risks for content creators and share a vision with all of our partners.\"", "overall-label": "life-style"}
{"content": "The 2019 Cross-Straits Esports Culture Festival recently expanded its presence to Beijing with a public class on the inspirations provided by Chinese traditional culture to popular video games. The three-month event, which kicked off in Shanghai on April 17, will feature a variety of activities for e-sports aficionados in Taipei and Kaohsiung as well. The Beijing event, which took place in Tsinghua Science Park on May 27 saw around 100 experts, researchers and industry insiders as well college students. Most of the public class speakers said that the diversity of Chinese culture had become a rich resource for domestic video game designers. For instance, the popular video game Happy Fish has a number of characters inspired from Peking Opera, Shan Hai Jing (the classic of Mountains and Seas) and some of China's intangible cultural heritage. Tencent's Honor of Kings, China's highest-grossing mobile game in 2018, had a deal with the Dunhuang Research Academy for a female character from Dunhuang's world-known   (flying goddess) murals. Sun Jiashan, a researcher from the Chinese National Academy of Arts, said the passing on and use of cultural legacies should end the myth that pop culture is against high culture. He added that video games, which have a huge and fast-expanding market, could also be exploited as a medium to convey traditional values and promote traditional culture.", "overall-label": "life-style"}
{"content": "A branch of Beijing's Palace Museum, generally known as the Forbidden City, will open in Hong Kong in 2022 to give residents and tourists an opportunity to view some of China's most treasured artifacts. On May 28, the ground-breaking ceremony for the Hong Kong Palace Museum was held at the West Kowloon Cultural District, marking the official kick-off of construction. Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government, attended the ceremony and delivered the keynote speech. She said the building of the Hong Kong Palace Museum cannot be separated from the strong support of the central government and the practice of the \"one country, two systems\" policy.,\"The collections in the Palace Museum are the essence of Chinese culture and the treasures of human civilization. The Hong Kong Palace Museum will display the cultural treasures of the Forbidden City in a long-term, comprehensive and in-depth manner, which will greatly help Hong Kong's cultural undertakings,\" she said. The director of the National Palace Museum, Shan Jixiang, said that Beijing's Palace Museum will cooperate with its Hong Kong counterpart in such fields as multimedia, cultural and creative products and lectures. He also hoped the treasures of the Palace Museum would \"come alive\" and step into the daily lives of Hong Kong residents. The Palace Museum and Hong Kong authorities signed a memorandum of cooperation on the Hong Kong Palace Museum in Beijing in December 2016.

{"content": "A report by China Central Television, China's state broadcast network, Tuesday shows a crisscrossed transport network will take shape in the Xiongan New Area in the future. Upon completion of several high-speed railways, intercity railways and highways, travel time between Xiongan to both Beijing and Tianjin will be reduced to 30 minutes and between Xiongan to Shijiazhuang, capital of Hebei province, will be 60 minutes. And it will take only 20 minutes for people in Xiongan to arrive at Beijing's new airport in Daxing district. The report came on the heels of a conference on coordinated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, held in Beijing the same day. According to the conference, the development of transport infrastructure and ecological and environmental projects are expected to accelerate in Xiongan New Area, Xinhua reported. Presiding over the conference, Vice-Premier Zhang Gaoli highlighted the importance of the area, a new economic zone about 100 kilometers southwest of Beijing designed to integrate the capital with surrounding areas. Thanks to a concerted effort by experts, the framework plan for Xiongan New Area has basically taken shape, he said. It is necessary to launch a group of key projects at a proper time and accelerate the development of transport infrastructure and ecological and environmental projects in the Xiongan New Area, Zhang said. It is also important to invite more domestic and foreign talent to participate in the creation of Xiongan and formulate investment, finance, tax and land policies supporting the development of the area, he added. China announced plans in April 2017 to establish the Xiongan New Area, which covers Hebei province's Xiongxian, Rongcheng and Anxin counties. The country aims to \"develop forward-looking plans and adopt high standards for building Xiongan New Area\", according to the report of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in October.", "overall-label": "business"}
